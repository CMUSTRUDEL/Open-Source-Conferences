Description: 
	Here is “The Manager’s version” - My two cents about making things happen.

Taking part in several bootstrapping adventures, I will be happy to share my experience from “Behind the scenes” of what it takes to bootstrap a new ops organisation in fast growing and ever changing environment.

	00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,400
so one thing over several things this

00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,980
stock going to be focused on

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,509
bootstrapping operations team it's going

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,000
to be focused on bootstrapping

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:20,400
and the unique challenges that you have

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,859
these operations teams it's not going to

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,080
touch the general elements of

00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,210
engineering management mostly focused on

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,590
operations teams another thing is the

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,700
reason I got to talk about bootstrapping

00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,399
is a because I love to do bootstrapping

00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:39,690
the reason I love to do bootstrapping is

00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,809
you get an opportunity to do something

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:44,850
new and also probably in many cases you

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,770
basically shape things according to your

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,350
vision according to your views and you

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,910
have a big say in what you're doing the

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,289
other thing especially here in Israel

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:56,840
there are a lot of opportunities here

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:59,910
for bootstrapping many companies open

00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,070
new adventures here year after year

00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,449
after year so always there is a need for

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,710
a person that know how to do

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,380
bootstrapping another thing this is the

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,119
manageress version which means in most

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,159
cases in talks what you're going to hear

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,560
is either consultancy groups or you're

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,119
going to hear engineers talking about

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,610
their day-to-day life and their needs

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,290
and so on and I think it would be

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,259
interesting little bit just to give the

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:27,990
managers angles what I see as the

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,130
challenges where I come into play and so

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,020
on and again finally it's based on my

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,420
own personal experience this is my

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,280
personal story there is no right or

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,579
wrong here or anything else this is just

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,960
my story

00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,240
another thing about bootstrapping there

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,340
are several types of bootstrapping one

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,049
of them I would call greenfield which

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,659
means basically bootstrapping a new

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:53,549
company from scratch first person in a

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:56,369
company first operations person in the

00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:57,450
company probably five to ten people just

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,119
starting the development

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,009
another thing is a brown field which

00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:03,799
means bootstrapping operations

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,750
organization within an existing team

00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,440
existing organization I had a fair share

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,730
in both type of adventures I probably

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,010
going to go back and forth a little bit

00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,709
but my own personal preference is the

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,599
with one I think by the way we were so

00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,689
in a rush so I didn't had the chance

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,939
even to introduce myself

00:02:20,689 --> 00:02:25,349
so my name is you have lava shaked I am

00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:28,439
the head of Production Engineering got

00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:30,480
here mobility actually if I should

00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:33,269
define myself it would be probably as a

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,459
cyclist if I had a time I will probably

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:39,299
cycle all day but eventually I ended up

00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:42,090
as a Head of Production Engineering in

00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:44,790
this talk I going to go through the path

00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,730
from the moment you pick your destiny or

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,200
you pick your adventure how to what are

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:51,810
these things that I look for a company

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,909
when when I choose to work for another

00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,670
thing is about the management team the

00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:58,319
one that I going to be part of then I go

00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:00,540
probably I going to go a little bit

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,629
about like the first days basically day

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:07,920
0 and they did more then the siege phase

00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:09,599
of setting a new operations team then

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,420
what happens when your team grows from

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:17,209
four to ten people and then what happens

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:17,209
beyond ten to 30 people and beyond so

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,650
let's talk a little bit about how I

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,090
personally choose my companies or the

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,590
companies that work for what are the

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,010
signals that I'm looking for

00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,639
that can promise me good operational

00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:38,190
challenges and basically gonna give you

00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:41,549
going to give me personally a good

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,989
opportunity to come into play so again

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,459
it'll be personal preferences they're

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:46,620
looking for companies in the early stage

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,389
if you come in early stage you have an

00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,269
opportunity to have a good impact or a

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,370
huge impact on the company other big

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:56,010
nose signals I would look for would be

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,150
around scale and complexity places that

00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,459
going to have scale and complexity

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,099
probably going to provide some

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,169
operational challenges also companies

00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:08,190
that have that have the potential for

00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:10,859
hyper growth if you see or if you spot a

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,319
company that has a large user base that

00:04:10,859 --> 00:04:16,109
can be interesting as well

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,000
another thing is SAS or online companies

00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:19,349
so basically a company that the uptime

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,049
is the king that you need to be

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:24,870
available available all the time uptime

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,190
means operational challenges there are

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,830
some other companies companies do it

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:29,690
hardware

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:32,150
on-prem stuff and so on these are less

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,320
than less in my interest and probably

00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,780
the way I see it

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,490
promise less operational challenges or

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,520
at least more contained operational

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,220
challenges another thing I would look

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,990
for is probably about the product what

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,700
type of product the company or the

00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:49,040
business domain that the kind that the

00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:52,220
company operates and the type of product

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,290
or the type of markets again there are

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,540
some business domains that prone to

00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,490
provide more operational challenges and

00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,560
the operational challenge is going to be

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,570
different according to the business

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,640
domains let's take for example companies

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,350
that deliver entertainment is going to

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,540
have a different operational mentality

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,340
then companies are deliver payments

00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,740
different challenges different

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:15,380
operational mentality some people by the

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:17,930
way enjoy the security aspect of

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,600
operations probably they should pick a

00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:24,860
company that suits those charge those

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:26,930
preferences another thing is the

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:31,310
business model so you can have a

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,650
business model of small user base but

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,410
highly paid users and that going to

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,780
enforce certain operational mentality on

00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,700
the organization another thing is more

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:44,360
the b2c mode which you're going to have

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,410
probably huge user base may be free

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,760
model or even or paying just a small fee

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,740
but again you're going to have you

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,410
choose a huge amount of users that you

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,820
need to support so these are basically

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,490
the things that are looking at company

00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:04,160
when I when I personally pick my own

00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:06,650
adventure then the management team so

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,300
when you go and go through the interview

00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,240
process in a company you meet other

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,520
managers other engineers one of the

00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,169
things that I look when I when I go

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:18,800
through the intro interview process is

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:23,500
the operational mindset of my managers

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,510
and my peers my calling managers I

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:29,030
thoroughly question and ask about the

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:32,900
views about for example and to end

00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:35,180
responsibility measurement what do what

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:37,700
are their own personal challenges how

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,129
did they see me play come and play in

00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,809
the field again

00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,219
everything that can had an impact about

00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:44,839
the operational mindset because

00:06:43,219 --> 00:06:47,989
eventually if I don't know how many of

00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,969
you have been in previous talk what you

00:06:47,989 --> 00:06:52,129
want to build into the company you want

00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:54,289
to build an operational mindset you

00:06:52,129 --> 00:06:57,289
don't want to end up having the devops

00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:58,999
teams also probably what you need to

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:01,789
make sure that people are not looking

00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:04,519
for building but a DevOps team which is

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:07,309
basically the team that does what the

00:07:04,519 --> 00:07:11,569
developers doesn't want to do or doesn't

00:07:07,309 --> 00:07:13,699
know how to do another thing when I go

00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:15,139
through the interview process is for

00:07:13,699 --> 00:07:17,389
sure they are going to give there are

00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:19,219
going to be gaps I mean we're going to

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,599
have some different views about the

00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:22,849
operational mentality of the

00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,139
organization but at least I need to

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:26,779
understand if I have people that I can

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:32,719
form a joint agenda and carry through

00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:34,749
the challenges congratulations you pick

00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:37,699
your company and you're going to start

00:07:34,749 --> 00:07:39,409
your day zero probably the first thing

00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:41,629
you need to take in account when you

00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:43,610
start your job you might going to be the

00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:46,219
first person or might going to be with

00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:48,259
just additional engineer and you just

00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:50,899
need to carry through and help the

00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:54,319
business grow one thing you need to

00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:57,409
carry my to carry in mind that your

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,479
first goal is enable cold shipping the

00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:02,629
build pipelines take the code from the

00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:04,699
developers machine out to production

00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:06,439
this is your main concern everything is

00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,300
interesting there are tons of things to

00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:10,819
do but remember or at least in my

00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,099
adventures in most cases what you end up

00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:15,529
is resource constrained constrained or

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:17,479
time constraints so your main focus

00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:19,909
should be helping developers get their

00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:22,369
code from the machine to the production

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:26,029
environment another thing you should

00:08:22,369 --> 00:08:28,579
focus on is is helping the company

00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:30,559
manage the debt there are many debts

00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:32,930
that you accommodate over time probably

00:08:30,559 --> 00:08:35,269
in the operational aspect they are there

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:39,229
are technical debts there are security

00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:40,909
debts some aspects especially on the

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:43,370
beginning you spend a lot of money you

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,290
don't count the money okay and this is

00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:47,470
another day that you need to help other

00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:52,100
you need to help the company to manage

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:53,940
and the third important task would be

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,269
probably hiring

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,339
hiring take a long time it's a huge

00:08:57,269 --> 00:09:03,600
effort I continue that at my current

00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:07,050
adventure it took me it took me a year

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,149
to hire three people the interview

00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,579
process is long very difficult to find

00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:15,079
people you all probably know that start

00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:17,220
to invest on that from day one

00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:20,190
another thing that important to remember

00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,410
is the unpredictability and the nature

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,389
of a bootstrap things going to change

00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,459
things going to go not going to go the

00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:28,889
right way priority is going to change

00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:30,959
product is going to shift remember that

00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:33,060
your key role in the organization is to

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,850
be an enabler not to setback the

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:38,190
organization always you need to shift

00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,850
and pick a path and see how you enable

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:43,769
the organization another important

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,380
important thing to remember at the

00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:50,040
beginning at the beginning is a small

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,899
group not a lot of people this is the

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,690
time that you get chance basically to

00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,610
work with the seed of the company form

00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,870
their relationships form the alliances

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,870
get better understanding of your

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,610
surroundings the company will grow you

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,800
won't have the same relationship and it

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,959
will it will be even more difficult to

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,990
develop relationship your relationships

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:12,360
over time what I do suggest is invest

00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:15,839
the time and spend the time with your

00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,130
peers at this period it's going to come

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,779
into play in the future when an

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,310
organization gotta grow you're going to

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:27,569
get much better cooperation and

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:30,779
understanding then the seed you just

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:33,779
started from team member number one

00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:38,819
which I have even a personal story to

00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:41,639
say up to a three team members I would

00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:45,870
call that phase the seed the first team

00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,880
member is probably the important one the

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,880
tedious team member going to be your

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,870
wingman it's going to help you it's

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,300
going to help you in the recruiting

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,430
process it's basically going to be part

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,259
of their recruiting attraction when you

00:10:56,430 --> 00:11:00,480
start to interview people you're gonna

00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:02,850
pick this person in the front and you're

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,920
gonna put yourself in at the front make

00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:07,090
sure you have a good candidate that can

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,920
help you attract people

00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,360
another thing is you need to have

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,130
someone that can be a technical

00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,440
Authority and other several knowledge

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,320
and understanding make sure you pick

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:20,380
someone your first seed as this kind of

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:23,140
person about the high regard not going

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:24,610
to dive too deep here just going to say

00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,350
just gonna say a few words because

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,130
hiring can be actually a separate topic

00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:33,190
for a separate talk what we look for

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,930
mainly in hiring is mindset and

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,990
foundations we're not looking for

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:41,650
knowledge in tools or specifics cloud

00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:44,530
providers for example we just mostly

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,570
check operational mindset does it have a

00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:49,360
good foundations we can build you can

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,520
build on and learn new tools decent

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,710
coding skills and that's it this is the

00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,000
most important the other things is at

00:11:53,710 --> 00:12:00,580
this phase don't take juniors

00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:04,120
at this phase unfortunately you need to

00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:05,650
be really focused on execution and you

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,090
can't afford someone that you need to

00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:11,920
carry on and teach and then there is the

00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:13,990
part of the internal branding and you

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,480
should remember this is very important

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,100
at the beginning this is probably how

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,420
the operations team going to be

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:24,130
perceived in the future remember again

00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:27,430
to develop the mindset within your team

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:30,250
and tower's the organization as an

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:32,650
enabler how they can to approach I mean

00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:35,080
I know many smart operation people that

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:37,630
knows a lot and always going to show you

00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:40,960
the setback don't be this kind of person

00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:43,780
don't create this kind of mentality see

00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,450
how you can push them forward the last

00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:47,920
thing to remember is probably you're

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:49,420
going to encounter many people that

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,550
doesn't have operational amounts and

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,350
mindset doesn't care about operations

00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:55,050
doesn't want to know anything you're

00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,960
gonna meet this type of developers

00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:02,410
taking account that this is how it is

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:04,980
and your role is to teach and see how

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:10,270
you can pull them in rather than shout

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:12,700
pushback or get into fights another

00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,260
topic that I don't have written here but

00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,630
it's probably a little bit important

00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,730
that to touch at this phase is the

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:20,910
discussions about build versus buy

00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:22,800
should I build this tool should I

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:25,620
distel should I build my own monitoring

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,840
should i buy my own monitoring probably

00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,170
at this phase in the seed phase of the

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:32,010
company and your team buy buy whatever

00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,040
you can

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:36,810
the only reason not to buy is a or

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,640
reasons you don't buy is a you don't

00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:44,280
have the money to buy and then you have

00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:46,080
no choice B you can't find you can't buy

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,770
it I mean you need a specific

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,330
operational feature that you can't buy

00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:53,520
Mogi going forward by the way it's going

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,770
to change some of the things or some

00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,110
aspects that might gonna end up being a

00:13:55,770 --> 00:14:00,120
core competence of your business you

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,490
might want to build take for example a

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,390
company sorry you might yeah you might

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:06,330
want to build

00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:09,590
take for example company like logs IO

00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:11,940
which deliver logs and use elasticsearch

00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,980
probably what they should do is build

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:21,780
their own elasticsearch clusters rather

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:23,250
than buying it from elastic then let's

00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,740
talk a little bit about what happens

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,900
when you become a team a team from four

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,960
up to ten people this is by the way I

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:33,690
think ten if you're a good manager you

00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:36,030
can manage directly ten people but this

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,490
is basically where the limit comes and

00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:40,650
it's become more than that you need

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:44,130
another managers or break the team into

00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:46,860
smaller pieces so one of the challenges

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:49,470
of having an Operations team is it's a

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,420
multidisciplinary team if you take a

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,850
development team they have the product

00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,920
they have a clear stack which means the

00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,100
development language clear process how

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,200
to ship the code and that's it when you

00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,190
talk about operations team you're going

00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,710
to have people that are going to be

00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:07,110
specialized in security build systems

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:11,090
some infrastructure components like

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:14,190
Kafka MongoDB and so on those people

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:16,500
still need to act like a team these are

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,330
the people at this phase that gonna

00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,180
provide all the operational needs for

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,350
the organization so in one hand you're

00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:25,110
going to have people that gonna have

00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:27,120
specialised competency around a specific

00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:29,100
area on the other hand for example

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,190
everyone need to be able to do the

00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:34,560
on-call shift so you always need to make

00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,420
sure that you create this shifting

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,420
and people learn from each other maybe

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,510
not specialized but still need to be

00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,220
able to fulfill each other tasks another

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,230
thing which is probably unique to

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,560
operations team is the context switching

00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,330
operations teams suffer from huge

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,330
context switching one of the reason is

00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:56,130
basically the ratio in most cases what

00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:59,610
you're going to have a dis situation for

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:01,650
example my own personal situation the

00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:04,410
ratio is one to ten so I have one

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,070
operation team up 200 developers against

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:10,050
tiny developers this and especially at

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,120
this phase generate huge contacts which

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,950
people always come into your team area

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,320
not necessarily by the way because

00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:18,990
something wrong with what the operations

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,700
team deliver many cases you just don't

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,339
know where the problem is or how to

00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:26,820
operate a specific thing and again this

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:29,250
created create a flux of context of

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,870
context switching around your team there

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,910
are many ways to mitigate that and if

00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,830
you want to come talk to me later and

00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:38,390
probably for every organization it's

00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:41,460
going to be different but again solvable

00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:46,560
another thing that is unique for an

00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,120
operation team is the ownership in

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,280
product development team you're going to

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,620
have a product person and you're gonna

00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,339
have maybe a project person even and

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,540
then you're going to have the

00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:56,280
development team and they're gonna

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,950
manage the backlog they're going to

00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,660
manage the external relationships with

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:03,510
other teams or with the customer and so

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,160
on mostly in operations team you don't

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,900
have these people you don't have the

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,689
people that you don't have a product

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,250
owner for example what it means that at

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:14,069
a certain phase your team members need

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:16,260
to be people that can stand up that can

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,540
actually take in charge on specific

00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,850
component that can take care of a

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:23,699
backlog communicate with development

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:25,980
teams priorities all this kind of stuff

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,260
it's very difficult to do alone as a

00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,760
manager by yourself you need to make

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,830
sure in your hiring process that you

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:36,600
pick people that can take this liability

00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,310
another challenge not written here and

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,040
probably it's not a challenge but this

00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,450
is something I noticed over time is that

00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,580
operations team are a little bit

00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:45,929
disconnected from the business every

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,280
time you're going to hear that we are so

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,390
lower on the stack it doesn't matter

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,310
are gonna pass to a different company

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,440
it's gonna be the same I'm gonna be the

00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:57,010
same the business doesn't matter

00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:01,870
I think cooperations team can benefit

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:05,400
from better engagement but again in most

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:05,400
cases that I've seen it doesn't happen

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,850
now let's touch a little bit about

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,260
evolution the 10 to 30 t to 30 team

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,320
members or people in the ops

00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:21,460
organization and a little bit about the

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:24,160
beyond so for the 10 and 30 people what

00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,540
probably gonna happen is and we've seen

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,310
that in the previous one they're going

00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,590
to be the platform over at the platform

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,390
teams or basically feature op teams

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,850
you're gonna have team that gonna focus

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:36,430
on security a team that got that kind of

00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:39,630
focus on the build a team got that gonna

00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,160
focus on data engineering and so on

00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:44,050
you're going to start to manage managers

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,270
it's going to be different for you as

00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:49,210
well managing managers it's different

00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,340
from managing a team another thing is

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,560
you probably going to have product

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,060
people that connect product or project

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,950
people that going to help you carry the

00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:01,570
burden at this phase you're probably

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:04,050
going to consider to change a little bit

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,000
the mode of operation so in many cases

00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:09,430
you're gonna see that you operate you

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,560
have your feature teams and some teams

00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,990
you're gonna have embedded people within

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:16,480
the teams you're gonna have some people

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:18,430
that gonna do mostly consultancy senior

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,920
people that going to do design reviews

00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:22,840
that going to go with with each team and

00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:25,060
team and go and go to their architecture

00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,550
and the design review and the design

00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:29,410
process that they have so you're going

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:31,960
to have multiple modes of operations

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:36,070
within your operational your operations

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:38,890
organization the last one with probably

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,080
not many people get to meet is basically

00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:44,200
get to the point that you have more than

00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:48,250
30 people and it's not only the feature

00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:50,590
teams and so on the organization become

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,350
huge may be thousand two thousand

00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:54,700
engineers and at this point what

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,290
probably going to happen you're going to

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,600
shift to the mode of the knobs or

00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,850
basically everybody doing

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,950
ops you're going to have things for

00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:05,429
example you

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:08,070
see that supplement form Netflix or

00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:10,769
Pinterest there is a team that run the

00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:13,620
clock de Kafka cluster the Kafka

00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:16,260
clusters consists between $2,000 up to

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:18,840
5,000 nodes they have around 30

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:21,690
engineers that make sure that these

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,630
operational components up and running

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:26,730
this is what these engineers do so these

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:30,090
are not now operations engineers

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,370
basically this is the Kafka or data

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:34,230
event pipeline team or whatever but this

00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,510
is a team that focused on operations and

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,580
you're gonna find many teams like that

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:42,480
another thing for example if you look at

00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:45,539
Airbnb the payments team 150 people

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,740
maybe 200 even these days probably

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:50,220
you're going to find people over there

00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:52,470
just run the operations that with

00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,960
specific appliance and specific security

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,990
for a team and team and all gonna be

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:04,320
under the payments team not under the

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:06,620
operational organization probably the

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,440
key takeaways that I would like to leave

00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:12,809
before we finish this talk is when you

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:16,529
choose for adventure look for complexity

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:19,049
and scale and operational mindset second

00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:20,700
thing the early days very very important

00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:24,029
you're gonna reap what you sow if you're

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,760
gonna invest in solid foundations and

00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:27,919
good relationship it's gonna serve you

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,600
in the future

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,909
last thing but probably the most

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:39,360
important is to be able to tell when you

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:40,950
become from an abler to a liability at a

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,350
certain point you took decision in the

00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:45,990
past and they worked and they were fit

00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,779
to a certain situation over time when

00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,659
things changing if your team doesn't

00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:54,090
adapt you become a liability if your

00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:56,899
team becomes a team that can support if

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:59,519
the team become that slows the business

00:21:56,899 --> 00:22:01,230
then you need again to take a look on

00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,720
this specific team or specific

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,919
functionality and see how you figure out

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,309
the model that become an enabler again

00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:11,080
that's it

00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:13,030
any questions yep

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,570
and what do you do or why did you do it

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:19,660
- you know attract people so when you

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,880
get more qualified candidates and more I

00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:26,140
think two things mainly I have an

00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:31,660
amazing seed the first few people that

00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:33,490
not started basically very good well

00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,080
let's be honest one of the things we do

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:40,330
at our interview process is pretty hard

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,820
it's basic but hard and it makes most

00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:46,000
people humble and also it's exposed the

00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:48,250
knowledge of our team members so it's

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,080
sort of complement and then people want

00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:51,970
to work with a good team so this is why

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,400
I said in the seed phase if you have a

00:22:51,970 --> 00:23:05,710
good team if you have a good seed

00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:08,050
this is crucial for equipment first the

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,000
definition of junior's can vary I have

00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,430
for example one person that have been in

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,110
the Army like four that served in the

00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:16,930
Army and technical unit for like seven

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,550
years he has no knowledge Amazon for

00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,170
example whatsoever and many other

00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,780
commercial tools and so on

00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:24,010
he's sort of a junior but still he did

00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,500
some work and has the operational

00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:29,620
mindset at my current phase this is the

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:31,750
kind of juniors I can deal with probably

00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,420
when you go beyond ten people when you

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,580
break it into smaller teams you can take

00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:39,430
basically people with zero knowledge

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,300
there zero knowledge about 100% of

00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:42,940
aspiration

00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:46,450
by the way motivation here is people

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:50,860
want to be good good obstacle play huge

00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:52,660
I bet I bet it before on people that

00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,230
didn't have any knowledge in operations

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:59,620
and there were that great I mean if they

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,840
want to be good at that they can thank

00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,380
you for your time guys

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:09,509
[Applause]
