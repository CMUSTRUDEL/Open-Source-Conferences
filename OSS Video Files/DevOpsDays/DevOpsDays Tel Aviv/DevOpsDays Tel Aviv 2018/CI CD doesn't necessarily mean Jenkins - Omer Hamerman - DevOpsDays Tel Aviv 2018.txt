Title: CI CD doesn't necessarily mean Jenkins - Omer Hamerman - DevOpsDays Tel Aviv 2018

Description: 
	Been working with Jenkins for years until I saw the light in tools like Travis, CircleCI & Drone; an open source, container-based, fast, stable, and plugins are a breeze. So, when I see docker oriented companies, with no super custom processes use Jenkins, I canâ€™t help but ask myself, WHY?

	00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:09,980
I'm going to be talking about why you

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,300
don't have to use Jenkins for your CICP

00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:14,340
last time I try to open a discussion

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,500
about this on reddit I got so much hate

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,810
and personal attacks that I wouldn't be

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,820
surprised if it happens today but please

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,960
bear with me for four minutes before you

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:27,240
start throwing things and we'll be okay

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:29,760
so my name is Omer I work at products

00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,090
formerly DevOps IL if you don't know us

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:35,790
come talk to me afterwards and let's

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,559
talk about waste so I want to take you

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,570
through a very common scenario which

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,879
some were probably most of you know

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,559
working with Jenkins so let's say you're

00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,780
logged into Jenkins your favorite CI

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,620
server and you try to find the job that

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,840
builds environment dev one so you try to

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,699
locate it and you'll know this fuzzy

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,370
search bar and you look for build

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,960
everyone and you find the right if you

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,140
find the first one that goes along you

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,100
click it but you actually build them too

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,750
so you cancel the job you go back you

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,000
find the right one and you run it and

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,270
then you go check the logs and you found

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,729
that it fit so you see why it failed and

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,130
then you find out that it actually had

00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:19,080
created some stacks on AWS and I you go

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,270
you have to go back to leave the stacks

00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,159
and then go back to Jenkins run the

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:27,450
right job and now everything's fine

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,640
right wrong so how can we improve this

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,360
process if we're using Jenkins we can do

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,020
a few things

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,750
so to minimalize how much we interact

00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,470
with UI we can do a few automated things

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,210
like web hooks so triggering our

00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,970
processes CI processes with web hooks

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,729
are much easier and faster we can use

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,430
remote commands like working with chat

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,110
up sports and stuff like that for

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,840
Jenkins itself we can use the Jenkins

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,549
file which is basically groovy script

00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,560
that describes job we can use

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,719
domain-specific language the job dsl

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,439
plugin for jenkins to build our jobs and

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,540
the entire infrastructure inside but

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,489
things will still be missing I mean it's

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,110
not really it is easy to scale plug-ins

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,890
development are not really that

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,410
straightforward

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,960
it wouldn't be self-healing and

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,750
wouldn't be stateless and seriously who

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:21,780
wants to write groovy

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:26,660
so drone to the rescue

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:29,000
who here ever heard about drone nice ok

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:33,120
nice

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,860
so drone is not special you can use many

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,870
other tools and products out there in

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,360
the market you have circle Travis cute

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,290
love built bucket they're all nice and

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,500
useful

00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:45,030
I chose specifically drone because first

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,130
of all it's completely open source so

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,020
you can install it in your own

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,270
infrastructure without being dependent

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,570
on anything it's written goaling it's

00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,850
really super easy to setup and it's just

00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:59,340
an awesome tool to work with why is that

00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,920
so so first of all drone is container

00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,660
native so container native means that if

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,110
you're already working with containers

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,440
and used to building images drone is

00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,750
really set up for that and masters

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,180
agents plugins steps in your pipeline

00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,730
everything is basically a container that

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,500
receives some parameters or commands and

00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,900
just exit that's all

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,340
in that sense building and plugging is

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,320
really easy if you want to build a new

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,110
plugin all you have to do is just choose

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,820
an image to base your container on it

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:33,209
doesn't matter what choose your own

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:37,200
preferred language of choice use that to

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:39,030
do some magic and just let it out drone

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,190
also has a really nice marketplace for

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,320
plugins it's not as big as Jenkins but

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:45,060
if you don't find what you want like I

00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:48,510
said it's really easy to develop a new

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,090
one another really cool thing is using

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,680
your own database so using drone in your

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,690
own infrastructure means you can tell

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,540
you control the database and having your

00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,459
own relational database means you get a

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,920
stateful in the carpet system it's easy

00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,239
to backup easy to install easy to

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,180
restore it's measurable

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,160
and it's square oval so if you take

00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,220
something like your fauna and connect it

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,500
as a back-end with your drone database

00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,200
you get all nice things you can run

00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,959
queries on everything see speed of teams

00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,650
speed of developers success failure

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,260
rates progress of different parts of

00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,910
your application and and the list goes

00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,730
on

00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:31,740
so bottom line of this whole talk don't

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,510
fixate on the one thing that everyone is

00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,910
using there may be other great tools out

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,160
there that better suit you so use what

00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,350
best suits you try to remove waste from

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,790
all processes and focus on what we all

00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:46,400
want which is innovation thank you

00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:51,529
[Applause]

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,529
