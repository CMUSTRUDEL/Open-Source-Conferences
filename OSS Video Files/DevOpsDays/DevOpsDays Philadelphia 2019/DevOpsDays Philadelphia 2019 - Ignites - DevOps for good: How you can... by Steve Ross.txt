Description: 
	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - Ignites - DevOps for good: How you can and should donate your skills to non-profits by Steve Ross

If you’re into DevOps, you probably have the skill and grit to volunteer your time for a non-profit near you. In this talk I’ll show you how your DevOps skills can be used to help service organizations that need it. If you want to make an impact in the world using tech, this is the way to do it!

I have experience volunteering tech expertise with several non-profits and have worked with others that volunteer as well. I’ll share specific parallels between DevOps practices (like CI/CD, tooling, automation, debugging, monitoring) and non-profit tech needs. I’ll also share some common employer benefits that attendees can take advantage of to help local non-profits.

really large tech companies in my career

00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,690
and I've worked for some really really

00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,160
small tech companies probably some logos

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,590
up there that you've never seen before

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,019
but no matter how big or small the

00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:07,689
company is I've been able to donate some

00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,390
of my time and my skills to nonprofits

00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:12,729
and so should you who needs help

00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,259

love puppies you can help puppies with

00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:17,680
nonprofits if you love trees you can

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,630
save trees if you love the city of

Philadelphia you can help save the city

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,960
of Philadelphia any passion that you

00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,570
have there's a nonprofit out there

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,930
that's looking for your help you have

00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,790
skills you have DevOps skills nonprofits

00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:32,890
are desperate for this kind of tech help

00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:35,320
getting started is really really easy

00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:37,420
and the best part is that your employer

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:39,040
will actually help you and even if they

00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,470
won't I have a solution for you at the

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,530
end so the first skill you have are

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:46,900
tools you have tools that you use every

00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:48,610
day for your job you can share those

00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:50,799
tools with nonprofits things that they

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,750
you take for granted that they may never

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,430
have even heard of before I mean there

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,500
are so many tools unlocking slack Trello

00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,509
G suite Salesforce LastPass Evernote

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,610
buffer zoom Adwords these are just a few

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:03,009
apps that are either completely free for

00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,540
nonprofits they have a free tier or they

00:02:03,009 --> 00:02:05,890
have some kind of nonprofit discount

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,299
rate which by the way if you make

00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,840
software and you don't give it away for

00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,030
free to nonprofits boo to you the second

00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,549
skill that you have is data wrangling if

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:17,590
you do anything in DevOps you know how

00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:19,480
to date handle large amounts of data

00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,340
small amounts of really important data

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,590
you handle data every day and you know

00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,720
how to extract information and value out

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:27,090
of that

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,099
don't underestimate how much data

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,900
processing small nonprofits have to do

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:31,950
by hand they have important data too

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,840
they just don't have as many

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,910
technologies for using it things like

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,860
Google sheets Excel even if you use

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:39,360
Python bashing a new plot to put

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,440
together a chart you probably have

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,720
skills that you can donate third is

00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,760
automation if you work in DevOps you're

00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,220
really really good at automation finding

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,959
toil and eliminating it if you're you

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,879
donate just a few hours to a non-profit

00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:56,819
you may be able to save them weeks or

00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,349
even months of their year nonprofits may

00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,940
not even know that some of their

00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,950
workflows can be automated with some

00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:04,349
tools that you take for granted you can

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,510
use things like a to us or Azure GCP

00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,430
free credits for nonprofits other

00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,230
services like if this and that or SAP

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:11,670
here you can automate things that

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,299
nonprofits didn't even know could be

00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,590
automated

00:03:12,299 --> 00:03:18,930
fourth is IT purchasing so if you work

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,480
in IT you're very familiar with buying

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:24,329
and selling software and the complex

00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,400
process involved in doing that if you

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,620
buy software for your job you know the

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,299
tricks of buying software if you sell

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,310
software for your job you know the

00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,500
tricks of buying software requirements

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:36,389
definition contract negotiation customer

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,190
support implementation these are all

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:40,380
things you can help nonprofits that need

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,549
to buy tech and they can save a lot of

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,849
money from your skills

00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:46,829
the last is teamwork so DevOps is at the

00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:49,019
cutting edge of teamwork and

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,780
collaboration and culture among not just

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,760
tech any industry and there a lot of

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,620
nonprofits are so focused on their

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,329
mission and helping the world that they

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,250
often don't have the time or the funds

00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:01,919
to think through how their team can

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,959
actually work better together in DevOps

00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,940
we have a whole bunch of things that

00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:08,040
we've developed like stand-ups literally

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,069
anything on the agile manifesto you can

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,940
just pull out and help a non-profit with

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,010
so at this point you may be thinking

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,419
like well Steve this is so great

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,940
tons of skills that I have but like I

00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,669
have no time to do this so you want to

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,910
know just how exactly do I expect you to

00:04:20,669 --> 00:04:27,360
do this and this is how employee

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,030
volunteer benefits you can get paid time

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,590
off to volunteer from your employer

00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:33,870
matching cash for your volunteering time

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,940
matching cash if you give cash donations

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,740
or even gifts in kind from your employer

00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,470
of the products and services that

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,810
you sell everyday if your employer

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,980
doesn't have a policy just ask them a

00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:45,990
lot of times they're willing to make

00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:48,480
accommodations if you just ask get a

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,250
group of employees together to volunteer

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,200
for maximum benefit and don't

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,090
underestimate the value of marketing and

00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,310
recruiting benefits for you posting on

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:58,890
Twitter about your your employer

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,300
donating if you don't know about a

00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,790
non-profit you don't know what to do

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,350
just volunteer for anything and then ask

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,660
the nonprofit they need tech help they

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:08,970
