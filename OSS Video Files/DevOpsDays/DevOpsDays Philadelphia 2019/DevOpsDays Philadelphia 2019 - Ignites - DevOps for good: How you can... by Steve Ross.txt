	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - Ignites - DevOps for good: How you can and should donate your skills to non-profits by Steve Ross

If you’re into DevOps, you probably have the skill and grit to volunteer your time for a non-profit near you. In this talk I’ll show you how your DevOps skills can be used to help service organizations that need it. If you want to make an impact in the world using tech, this is the way to do it!

I have experience volunteering tech expertise with several non-profits and have worked with others that volunteer as well. I’ll share specific parallels between DevOps practices (like CI/CD, tooling, automation, debugging, monitoring) and non-profit tech needs. I’ll also share some common employer benefits that attendees can take advantage of to help local non-profits.
