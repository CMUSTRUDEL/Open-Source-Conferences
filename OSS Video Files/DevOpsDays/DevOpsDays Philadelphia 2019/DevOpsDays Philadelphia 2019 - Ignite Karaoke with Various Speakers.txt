00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:19,640
okay sometimes when we're working in

00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:21,740
development or operations and thus

00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,300
DevOps we kind of feel like we have to

00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,009
protect our salts in the outside world

00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,619
one of the things we have to do is

00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:28,759
choose the right tools to do that

00:00:26,619 --> 00:00:30,110
bananas are good for scale if you want

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:32,329
to understand the size of something but

00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,829
not necessarily for protecting you when

00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,600
it comes to protection you can choose

00:00:33,829 --> 00:00:37,760
other weapons and maybe substitute

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,380
something in your environment so today

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,239
you'll be observing your environment and

00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,920
watching how things run I'm going to try

00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,260
and fit performance management in here

00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,179
somewhere

00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,579
and if you have the wrong performance

00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:52,460
management tool this is what can happen

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:55,129
in your environment particularly the day

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,730
after eating curries like this and then

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:00,440
if you're looking at you know maybe the

00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:02,989
guy beside you and the person beside you

00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,210
is working fine but you're not in the

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:07,310
same circumstance and you seek seek help

00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:09,830
with events like this sometimes the help

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,560
is not always clear but there is help

00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:14,210
out there that one of the things that it

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:22,730
is telling you what's going on will show

00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:24,620
you the right way but even with the

00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:26,810
right way you can still end up

00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,150
overloaded you can still end up with too

00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,700
much of a good thing so what you want to

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,350
do is bring yourself and make yourself

00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,630
into the happy person who can leap

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:36,650
through fields by having the right sort

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:38,000
of performance management your

00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:40,190
environment so you can see exactly

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,480
what's happening when it's happening so

00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:43,580
that you can get in front of the game

00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:50,120
instead of behind the game and be as

00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:51,620
cheery as that little fellow that was a

00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,470
ringer there's there's no way I can

00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:57,410
follow up on that but all right I am Ned

00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,830
what's up I am sure I'm ready let's do

00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,130
this

00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,050
all right you know there's a lot of

00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:05,120
power behind being able to build

00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,310
infrastructure on demand there's all

00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,489
sorts of nerd knobs and different

00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,870
toggles you can go with that could

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:13,670
create an infrastructure that is overly

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,830
complicated and impossible for you to

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:18,290
manage and that's why you need

00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,269
automation and machine learning and AI

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,430
to help you look at your infrastructure

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:24,770
and find places where you can improve

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,830
not only your security

00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:30,050
but also your data governance just like

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,300
the numbers on that computer if you

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,920
don't have proper security or a proper

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,460
data governance you could find yourself

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,390
in a whole lot of trouble perhaps you

00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:43,490
might even crash and burn

00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,550
therefore I highly encourage you to get

00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:48,410
into the world of AI and m/l don't be

00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:49,940
like this completely empty hangar where

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,940
the Zeppelin has already left the

00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,760
building but rather fly high with that

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,350
Zeppelin of AI and ml which anagrams

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,660
into mail if you think about it which is

00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,490
weird I don't know where I'm going with

00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,480
that neither desire neither does this

00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,680
guy he's clearly trying to dig up some

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,960
interesting information in his

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,090
environment but he's just got the shovel

00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,950
pointed in the wrong direction so not

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,820
only do you have to embrace AI and ml

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,260
when you're looking at your

00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,790
infrastructure you have to make sure

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,070
you're pointed in the right direction so

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,320
that your tower does not completely

00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:26,860
collapse and you end up in a squirrel

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,860
calamity and I think that's all I've got

00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:36,440
[Applause]

00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,640
well I have so many products to tell you

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,640
this isn't day and age

00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,970
where's 3398 today for you only it's to

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,650
be 20 to 98 and for another 15 95 we're

00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:47,650
gonna ship YouTube for the same price

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:55,580
did I say to make that floor for same

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,370
price we're gonna have this young lady

00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,990
here deliver them to you and finally bow

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,490
tied and wrapped up so you're really

00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,020
happy for those Christmas presents are

00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:09,740
coming up in his end of the year

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:11,480
oh my well I said just take a little off

00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,000
the top I was trying to get ready for

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:17,770
the Christmas party and I'm not quite

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,049
sure what I ordered and this is today I

00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:23,090
told you not to make a left off the exit

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:24,500
I told you to keep going straight down

00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:28,660
the road but you wouldn't listen to me

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,660
as usual and now we're another fine mess

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,150
and I'm dying here

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,530
and this is how we're going to supply

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:44,180
solve the problem about cabling through

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,800
our building we have too many problems

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,240
with it we're just going to drill a big

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,260
hole and we're going to put the cable

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,240
through the wall

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:54,640
I hear the system's working I think this

00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:05,930
time we got it right

00:04:54,640 --> 00:05:07,460
thump-thump thump-thump so a lot of

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:09,080
times when you've been at the company

00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:13,700
long enough you have to train the new

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,590
hires and sometimes you have to start

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,880
with dress code because you never know

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,940
what they're gonna come in on day one

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:23,270
when you put formal casual and they

00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,740
decide real casual and then you have to

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:31,460
give them their first project and you

00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,530
say helium they use hydrogen and then we

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,850
all know how that ends so you always

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,310
want to make sure they've got there any

00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,780
virus up-to-date because otherwise you

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:40,970
may as well be wearing these glasses or

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:42,920
at least have them on hand because while

00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:47,750
you're crying in the backgrounds they're

00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:49,490
just sitting there putting out fires if

00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:52,610
I could read those instructions that

00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:54,110
would be helpful as well we do have

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,420
dinosaurs at my work I don't know about

00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,780
you they are the ones who pawned off

00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:01,220
this new hire on to me because they are

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,980
one of those people that have been there

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,580
so long they're like I don't have to do

00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,580
this anymore

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,710
you take the new guy because I have a

00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,380
drawer full of these that I still have

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,630
plenty of projects put together for them

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:18,110
I swear I can get snapchat to work on

00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:19,640
that Eadie's model cell phone I don't

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,090
want my new hire messing up my new

00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,090
project

00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:35,960
I was that new hire don't give me access

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,870
to root don't give me any of this

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,670
product

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:54,050
[Applause]

00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:54,050
