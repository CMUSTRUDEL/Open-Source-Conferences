Description: 
	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - CI/CD (Constantly Ignoring, Constantly Deflecting): A Case Study of Pervasive Indifference in Technology by Jocelyn Harper

Too often as technologists, we want to align ourselves with the apolitical when it comes to the products that we diligently work on. Over the past few years, and more so over the past couple of months, it is more evident than ever that the choices that the companies we work for and efforts that we support directly impact our society for decades to come in significant ways. With great power, comes great responsibility, and with great responsibility comes the hard reality that weâ€™re not just writing code and never were. With brief looks into Girl Develop It, npm Registry, Chef, and more, we will look at the historical context of these organizations and how by ignoring these apolitical stances we are feeding back into the cycle.

[Music]

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:20,680
hello everyone how are you this morning

00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:22,509
I am glad that you all are here all

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,400
bushy eyed and you have the coffee

00:00:22,509 --> 00:00:26,020
because today we're going to be talking

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,689
a little bit about philosophy and ethics

00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:33,850
in tech so in case you did not know I

00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:35,980
apologize so my talk is constantly

00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,100
ignoring constantly deflecting a case

00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:41,100
study of pervasive indifference in

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,100
technology

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,680
awesome

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,360
just a little bit about myself my name

00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,340
is Jocelyn Harper I am a senior

00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,620
associate software engineer at Calpol

00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:52,540
the one I'm currently a full-stack

00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,350
engineer and at Kaplan they mean that

00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:58,090
quite literally I am all over the place

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,710
primarily in the DevOps sector for our

00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:02,020
pipelines for all the applications that

00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,920
my team are in charge of and also mobile

00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:07,180
development as of two months ago

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,850
secondary to this I'm also the host of

00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,530
get cute podcast which is just a podcast

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,259
that I decided to start because I was

00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,090
really tired of sis white dudes talking

00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:19,750
to me about things in podcasts that I

00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:22,450
could not relate to so I decided to

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:24,820
start telling these things for my point

00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:26,770
of view and I'd like to say I'm kind of

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,570
funny in it so if you guys would like to

00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:34,780
subscribe to that I'm on all major

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:36,850
podcast platforms so ethics we're going

00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,490
to jump right into the fun stuff with a

00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,290
extremely condensed version of ethics

00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,409
and morality and how it all pertains to

00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,900
you and with tech that we have today

00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,970
just give me a moment there we go

00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:51,220
typically when you hear a conversation

00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:54,340
about ethics it's divided into two

00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,560
subjects personal in business personally

00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,820
and there are others that do you agree

00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,470
with me people that have gone to school

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,659
for this and have written papers and

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,759
books about it as well but these are two

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:05,290
entities that cannot be completely

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,570
separate when it comes to running a

00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,640
business I would dare to say that

00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:10,929
whenever we start a company aside from

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:12,939
the idea that we think it's going to

00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,319
make us money we all have already

00:02:12,939 --> 00:02:16,150
established a code of ethics with

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,310
ourselves for how we want our business

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,470
to be conducted of course this is much

00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:22,180
easier said than done because as we have

00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,630
witnessed throughout history the

00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:26,150
majority of businesses at

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,070
point-in-time know how matter how small

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:29,810
the infraction have pushed aside their

00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:40,040
ethics momentarily when it comes to

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:41,840
maximizing their profit perfect sorry

00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:52,490
technical difficulties don't know what's

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:54,230
happening there we go so the definite

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,880
definition of ethics I pulled this

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,490
directly from dictionary.com in

00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,840
Wikipedia org ethics are the moral

00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,250
principles that govern our person's

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,370
behavior or the conducting of an

00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,380
activity as far as business ethics are

00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,480
concerned they're also known as

00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,190
corporate ethics it's a form of applied

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,530
ethics or professional ethics that

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,510
examines ethical ethical principles and

00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:16,640
moral of ethical problems that arise in

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,290
business environments it applies to all

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,970
aspects of business conduct in is

00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,480
relevant to the conduct of individuals

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:25,520
and entire organizations that's really

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,800
the long-winded explanation of it but if

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,630
any of you have ever worked for a fairly

00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,520
large corporation to me I just think of

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:33,320
all the ethics trainings and modules

00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,180
that we have to go through that are

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,610
essentially telling you not to take

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,650
money from anybody not to accept bribes

00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:44,150
don't try to bribe anyone etc etc most

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,250
businesses start out well-meaning with

00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:48,230
the ethics that they set forth but it's

00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:49,730
most sure but as more shareholders that

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:52,010
do not share the company's initial dream

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:53,660
or ethics or start to be added though

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:55,460
shareholders start wondering why the

00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,170
company is not maximizing their profit

00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,880
it's where ethics start to take a

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,450
backseat to the overall bottom line and

00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:04,370
when things begin to blur in an effort

00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:06,500
to not sound too cynical about business

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,690
because I pretty much have the entire

00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,520
time I will say that a tech company off

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:12,110
the top of my head that's had a great

00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,360
public example of taking a stand with

00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:17,900
business ethics is Apple more notably

00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,299
their stance against the FBI in 2016 for

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:22,580
those of you that are unfamiliar the FBI

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,770
argued that in relation to accessing the

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,570
San Bernardino shooters phone in 2016

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,420
that it would only be in for that one

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:31,070
instance where Apple and Tim Cook put

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,660
its foot down and refused to help with

00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,850
the decryption in the bypassing of the

00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:36,350
feature after ten unsuccessful logins

00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,060
which involved in a day to wipe on the

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,560
phone

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,300
now regardless of how your personal

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,520
feelings about Apple as a business or

00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,910
anything aside about the San Bernardino

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,039
shooter aside the situation that Apple

00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:53,960
took was based on their moral ethics

00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,789
they knew that helping the FBI in that

00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,680
situation would also put Apple in this

00:04:55,789 --> 00:04:59,690
situation to be able to unlock a phone

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,449
at any other time any time the FBI

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,940
decided to take a judicial injunction on

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,620
them what could stop the FBI from

00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,840
acquiring another federal injunction for

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,639
Apple to unlock another iPhone people

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,199
Apple knew that accepting the federal

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,819
court ruling and unlocking the phone for

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,409
this one instance could start the ball

00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:16,940
rolling on what would be kind of be

00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:30,520
controversial government interference

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:30,520
and access to our phones there we go so

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,280
one of the best explanations of ethics

00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,530
is by the ethics guy and yes this is a

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,570
moniker that he goes by named Bruce

00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,190
Weinstein the principles that he

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,690
mentions are simplified and condensed

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,820
from the book the principles of

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,310
biomedical ethics by Tom elbow chomp and

00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:50,750
James L Childress he suggested the

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,159
following principles of ethics can be

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:57,169
applied to business and personal life

00:05:52,159 --> 00:06:02,830
one do no harm to make things better 3

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:05,270
respect others 4 be fair and 5 just care

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,860
now I'm not here to tell you how to

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,300
apply these principles of ethics to your

00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,130
life because I believe that how you

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,380
choose to interpret these is entirely

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:13,669
personal we all have our own personal

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:15,500
code of ethics that is loosely or

00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:17,020
rigidly based upon these principles that

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,219
we use to go through day to day life

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:21,560
luckily for us depending on what

00:06:19,219 --> 00:06:23,569
industry you work in shot out to the

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,639
heavily regulated financial industry

00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:26,870
that I happen to be a part of we're all

00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:28,159
so beholden to the ethics of the

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,469
companies that we work for and press

00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:32,389
upon us although a lot of their ethics

00:06:30,469 --> 00:06:34,460
contain legal jargon it is safe to say

00:06:32,389 --> 00:06:36,169
that when we strip that away business

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,460
ethics are loosely based off of the

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:39,740
following principles of ethics as well

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,449
because following business ethics will

00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,130
also keep you in line with the state and

00:06:41,449 --> 00:06:45,849
federal law and also turns out it's

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:45,849
profitable to

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:55,810
Thanks it's really cute makes me happy

00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:59,020
when I'm speaking all these things

00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:01,180
so an even simpler explanation is the

00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,610
difference between right and wrong in

00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,080
the case with Apple versus the FBI Apple

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,610
found that it would be wrong for the

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,920
company to bypass the encryption on the

00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:14,020
iPhone Tim Cook and Apple took that

00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:17,170
stand another example I see in a laptop

00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,460
in the audience that I want right I see

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,570
that has a cool sticker on the back of

00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:22,390
it yada yada yada

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,530
so personally for me what is stopping me

00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:27,220
from taking someone's laptop so

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:29,350
essentially you could say the owner

00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:31,270
would stop me other people in the

00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:33,670
audience if you're brave they would stop

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,170
me or even the fact that it's against

00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:37,330
the law would stop me but above

00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:40,090
everything else I analyze the situation

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,370
with this is it right or is it wrong

00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,980
regarding my own personal code of ethics

00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,990
so besides me being caught and

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:48,040
apprehended immediately I wouldn't steal

00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,030
the laptop because I believe that

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,310
stealing is wrong

00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,080
stealing is against my code of ethics

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:56,140
because it would not be fair and would

00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:58,360
cause harm to others so specifically the

00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,190
person that I'm stealing it from and

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:02,230
it's also important to note the net

00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:04,810
every decision is as binary as right or

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:07,150
wrong it depends on how closely tied and

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,800
how deeply that it affects you my take

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,910
on blatant racism won't be the same as

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,700
someone that doesn't have to deal with

00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:14,290
racism which for me is a shame because

00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,390
that's where empathy starts to come into

00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:17,590
play with along with your ethics I may

00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,570
not be able to identify with your

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:21,400
specific situation but I can still apply

00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:32,430
my rate code of ethics to seem to figure

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:34,690
out where it lies so ethics plus success

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,190
small business books will tell us that

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,330
you will have a successful business if

00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,190
you start out with a strong code of

00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,750
ethics for conduction of business and

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,290
also for your eventual expansion of

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,370
employees and don't get me wrong there

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:47,290
are companies out there that seemingly

00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,570
have the public perception of being good

00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,060
companies they have a great public image

00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,920
no notable public hiccups have a track

00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,150
record of good business dealings and do

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,220
you make with their customers and with

00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,900
their stakeholders at the helm the thing

00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,440
is is that most companies all start out

00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,390
that way but somewhere along the line we

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,550
the institution of a board or perhaps a

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:08,250
CEO switch like we've seen happen many

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:15,690
times over their ethics fear slightly to

00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:17,880
the left and sooner than you would think

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:20,130
we have talked about seemingly good

00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,830
business ethics but let us talk about

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,330
bad business ethics earlier we talked

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:26,460
about my sudden wanting need to steal a

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:29,640
laptop but businesses can steal in terms

00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:31,680
of resources time money materials they

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,870
can ally to employees they can lie to

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,060
customers in the government about the

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,950
dealings of their business they defraud

00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:39,360
customers and other businesses they can

00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,190
use their abundance of money to have a

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,710
heavy hand of political influences

00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,390
locally and nationally we have all seen

00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,940
this happen and it's still happening

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,500
within our lifetime aligning with my

00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,240
code of ethics I personally would not

00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,580
work for or financially support a

00:09:51,240 --> 00:10:01,410
company that has the public opinion of

00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:03,060
having poor business ethics so for the

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,560
sake of brevity we're going to focus on

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,480
the situation will aspect of morality

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,890
spectrum because that's where most of

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,600
you are when it comes to situation that

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:17,040
arise with tech companies that happen to

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:19,620
work with every single day here is the

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,110
more I always shown as a simplified

00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,330
spectrum I don't know if any of you had

00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,010
to even remember taking like a morality

00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,900
test when you was first started going

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:30,300
into public school I realized as I was

00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,040
writing this talk that I remember that

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,530
taking that when I was like four almost

00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,400
five beginning to kindergarten

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:37,650
essentially they just sit you in a room

00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,440
with a psychologist or psychiatrist and

00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:42,150
they administer a test with toys with

00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,490
colors and things to try to figure out

00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:46,770
where you lie on the morality spectrum

00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:52,170
and depending on where you lie you would

00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:54,060
get shifted to different classes now I

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,710
wouldn't be diving I won't be diving

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,350
into children's philosophy because a I'm

00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:00,390
not qualified to do that and there's a

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,610
whole lot of moral prisms that go just

00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,190
beyond the sake of this spectrum here

00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:07,410
but it's and it's beyond the scope of

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,000
this talk in the scope of me but so the

00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,230
centralized morality spectrum is enough

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,630
so as denoted by Mike Yukos moralistic

00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:17,550
is good virtuous up

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,400
I would say being moralistic all at the

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,640
time would make you chaotic good at the

00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,320
opposing end there is a moral bad

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,200
chaotic evil and then there's everything

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,089
between situational because sometimes

00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,310
epic is not black and white it's not

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:34,230
binary sometimes there are deciding

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:36,660
factors and how you will react and in

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,029
how you will gain some moral or a moral

00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:46,830
or perhaps be completely indifferent I

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:47,970
urge you not to be indifferent as I said

00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,180
before we're going to be talking about

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:55,770
situational okay and now this is cute

00:11:51,180 --> 00:12:00,690
for me so let's take a moment to think

00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:02,160
of technology as a whole as house and I

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,960
know that probably like an apartment

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,300
building or something would be better

00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,770
apt but I couldn't find a really spooky

00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,300
apartment building and it wasn't nearly

00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:11,070
as cute as this image so you guys will

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,529
just have to work with me on that so

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:16,080
it's a pretty old house many great

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,460
people mostly women but many great

00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,370
people have contributed to the

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,440
architecture that is the house of tech

00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,700
within this house there are many rooms

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,470
each room is dedicated to further

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,930
advancing our society for better for

00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:30,060
worse but seemingly for the better that

00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:33,420
is until we get inside of the closets of

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,760
these rooms as we know every closet has

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,560
their skeletons but how many skeletons

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,930
are we allowed to accept before we just

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,740
start asking are we supposed to be just

00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:48,540
okay with this so where do you stand

00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:49,950
it's a loaded question but it is no

00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,050
longer the time to tiptoe around the

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,220
issue it's not that these issues within

00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:55,830
our industry are becoming more prevalent

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,320
it's just easier easier for us to talk

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:00,150
about it now so say what you would like

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,220
about social media platforms like

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:04,140
Twitter it have become a great network

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,850
for people that may have not been given

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,160
a second glance and voicing concerns

00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:10,050
about issues in our industry like any

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,970
open forum there are concerns about echo

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,430
chambers but with certain topics like

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,839
overt racism and discrimination those

00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:18,750
are the type of echo chambers that I'm

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,490
okay with I have seen more people band

00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,870
together against unjust situations in

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,610
our industry with direct change as a

00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:25,500
result on Twitter that I can downplay

00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:28,800
what influence social media has given us

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:30,989
of course for better or for worse

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,629
however before we begin analyzing our

00:13:30,989 --> 00:13:36,509
very current situations and before you

00:13:33,629 --> 00:13:38,429
ask this question of yourselves let us

00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:42,019
look to our past perhaps have a better

00:13:38,429 --> 00:13:42,019
understanding of our future

00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,809
IBM cool

00:13:46,499 --> 00:13:50,129
nobody is shiftin nervously nobody's

00:13:48,809 --> 00:13:55,110
leaving that's exciting okay we're going

00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:57,869
on so IBM a lot of these let's say

00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:59,639
instances you can explain away with

00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,509
saying well how could they have possibly

00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:04,949
known what they were going to do with it

00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:07,829
and that's funny because that is exactly

00:14:04,949 --> 00:14:09,299
what IBM used as a defense when news of

00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:11,910
the business conduct it conducted with

00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:16,889
Nazi Germany in World War two hit the

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,420
news this is very condensed I'm not

00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:20,670
going to go into all the details about

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,100
this but I highly suggest you all read

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,600
the IBM in the Holocaust the strategic

00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,369
alliance between Nazi Germany and

00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,100
America's most powerful corporation by

00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:31,529
Edwin black it is arguably the most well

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,240
researched book detailing IBM and its

00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,009
subsidiaries involvement with Nazi

00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:37,110
Germany in the facilitation of genocide

00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,879
it was the book that brought the

00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,369
severity of IBM's involvement to light

00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,410
in 2001 and with it a new conversation

00:14:41,369 --> 00:14:45,449
about what roles and influences tech

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:49,499
companies have in our society for better

00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:51,629
or for worse as Michele giulio noted in

00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:53,819
her article did IBM help Nazis in World

00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:55,769
War two yes he did

00:14:53,819 --> 00:14:57,569
for Wired magazine IBM technical

00:14:55,769 --> 00:15:00,240
technology allowed Hitler's troop to

00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:02,100
achieve scale velocity and efficiency

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,389
that would have been impossible without

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,100
computerization and when I saw that it

00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,019
may gave me chills because isn't that

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,879
something that we do right now with our

00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:16,439
applications to make sure that we have

00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:19,980
scale velocity in efficiency except for

00:15:16,439 --> 00:15:21,990
them it was mass murder and so what

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,939
computerization you ask it's as simple

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:26,069
as a punch card and the Machine agos

00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:28,230
with it a punch card that tracked the

00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:29,790
ethnicity of Germans and made it much

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,709
more efficient for the Nazis to carry

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,709
out the extermination of Jews and others

00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,170
so again

00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,300
situational as new scandals and by

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,490
scandals let's just say that the public

00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,080
is becoming more aware and informed

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,060
about what is happening behind closed

00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,010
doors at these tech companies you cannot

00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,990
help but wonder where the company's

00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,990
epics align with the shareholders bottom

00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:58,270
line we have donated much of our lives

00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,560
to either consume or be consumed by the

00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:01,779
products that these tech giants have

00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,040
created and now more than ever we should

00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:05,260
be realizing that they are touching

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,990
every facet of our livelihoods and even

00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:09,730
now our democratic process I would argue

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:11,110
that as employees we should be holding

00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:13,540
our companies and ourselves to higher

00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:15,130
standards I understand the willfulness

00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,870
to slip away into retirement without

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:20,110
making as much as a peep because that is

00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:21,520
my default however if we're going to

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,020
follow the principles of ethics that

00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,850
Weinstein laid out beautifully in my

00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,920
previous slide it is when things start

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,440
to start showing themselves is unfair

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:31,600
uncaring and harmful and it doesn't just

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,279
have to be me or to me or any of the

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,140
communities that it identifies and

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,660
that's where empathy starts to come into

00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:45,400
play and that's when I start my call to

00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:47,800
action who okay so here we have a

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,660
timeline of 2019 please ignore on

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,250
November and December obviously those

00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,960
months have not happened yet so nothing

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:55,630
I can't predict the future

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,250
so I'm going to give you a quick rundown

00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:59,380
of the situation that arose at Tuck

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,900
companies and those that run said to

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,900
companies this year in 2019 let me

00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:07,600
preface this by saying I will try to

00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,310
remain impartial I'm really hard with

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:13,709
that because my face tends to give what

00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:13,709
I'm thinking away so just ignore my face

00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,429
specifically I want to be completely

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,880
transparent girl develop it I was

00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:25,030
personally devolved in whatever don't

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,160
want to cause a situation that was so I

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:28,929
cannot remain impartial for that but

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,400
again I do feel as though all these

00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:31,660
situations are valid and should garner

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,760
thought and I won't but happy to

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:38,230
facilitate that for you so 2019 and I'm

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,670
so happy that the Congress hearing

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:41,590
happened in January so I could talk

00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:43,390
about Cambridge analytic and everything

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,270
it's very exciting so Mark Zuckerberg

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,320
testifies before Congress Congress what

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:50,440
is he testifying in front of Congress

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:52,240
for someone that has been living under a

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,670
rock might ask or somebody that just

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,560
doesn't

00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:56,210
attention to techniques at all he is

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,040
testifying in front of Congress because

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:01,340
of the Cambridge analytical situation of

00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,530
2018 and what happened in that situation

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,430
Cambridge analytic huh a company that

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:06,560
was linked to Donald Trump's

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,940
presidential campaign because Trump's

00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,010
campaign used the data for voter

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,950
outreach mishandled the data that

00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:16,730
Facebook was allowing the company to use

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:18,470
so again why is Mark Zuckerberg

00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:20,360
testifying before Congress that seems

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:23,540
like a Cambridge analytically issue and

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,820
not really because of the ties of the

00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:27,650
Trump campaign Facebook became entangled

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,810
in the Russian investigation surrounding

00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,580
the 2016 election and Cambridge

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,070
analytical gained access to private date

00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:40,490
of over more than 50 million Facebook

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:43,790
users moving on to March 2019 and PM our

00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,740
favorite package manager so comes to a

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,970
head with employees and continues a

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:50,330
series of layoffs that they actually

00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:52,910
started mid summer of 2018 I don't think

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,440
a lot of people understand that three of

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,510
the five employees that were happening

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:58,460
to be fired for an PM however in March

00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,670
claimed that they were fired because

00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:03,140
they were trying to unionize unionize he

00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,120
was in tech is a topic that needs to be

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,130
talked about right now not just because

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,560
about NPM allegedly firing these

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,300
employees for trying to unionize but we

00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:13,270
have seen the courage of not having a

00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,070
union for tech workers firsthand

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:18,470
especially with game developers and the

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:21,500
most recent one that I want to talk

00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:24,380
about is Amazon who weighed off just in

00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,270
June 2019 a dozens of developers and

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:28,850
dozens as what is used in their words

00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:31,010
it's closer to 100 of developers of at

00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:35,150
foreign Amazon games organization

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:37,010
reorge April 2019

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:38,630
green warned house steps down as

00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,190
executive director of girl development

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,050
amidst allegations of racial

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:43,730
discrimination against employees at

00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:46,820
headquarters here in Philadelphia and

00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:48,680
also national chapter leaders if any of

00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:50,540
you are not where or familiar with the

00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:53,660
situation with girl development in late

00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:55,340
2018 of last year news broke that there

00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,290
was racial discrimination happening at a

00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:58,820
chapter in Minneapolis against one who

00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:02,360
is what now one of my friends Lenny

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,070
Simms and then further probing it also

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,730
turns out that it ran much deeper to

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,120
discriminatory micrograph

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,970
and sometimes full-on aggressions

00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:13,320
allegedly being made toward only black

00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,760
toward the only black female employee

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,220
that worked at headquarters at time

00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:19,560
right here in Philadelphia from that

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,060
spurred a movement movement from the

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,410
current chapter leaders calling for girl

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,000
development to make it the major

00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,820
organization will changes to the board

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,740
and for Warren house to resign now that

00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:32,670
was an October 2018 and it took her a

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:36,330
few months to actually do that right

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,980
September 2019 set Vargo a current

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:40,170
engineer at Google Cloud and a former

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,970
employee of chef calls out chef and

00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:44,630
removes code from chef's open-source

00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:47,960
repo after he discovers his chef had a

00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:49,950
$95,000 year-long contract with ice

00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,080
something to note that before chef

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,760
eventually backtracked with also a large

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,130
outpouring of concern from current

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,840
chef's employees about the contract they

00:20:56,130 --> 00:21:00,270
also said that they were going to donate

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,460
the full contract the money that they

00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:06,750
made from the contract to organizations

00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:08,460
which is great however they did say that

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:10,440
they were going to fulfill their current

00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:13,560
contractual obligations to ice and CBP

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,090
but chef also prefer to keep personal

00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:19,500
politics out of its business decisions

00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,870
will touch back more on that later I

00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:26,970
promise that whole slide okay October

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:29,130
2019 so we're current now and 2019 seems

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,370
to be a really bad year for Mark

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,590
Zuckerberg and October seems to be a

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:37,200
really bad month for Mark Zuckerberg I

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:40,500
think there's four things that he's been

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,330
a part of so anyway let's get into it at

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,370
the beginning of the month recordings

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:45,870
from to July meanings of Zuckerberg

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:48,390
addressing concerns with Facebook

00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:50,460
employees were leaked in these meetings

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:52,710
he talks of Elizabeth Warren I'm

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:53,850
favoring Lee a lot of people do and this

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,040
is said if she were to win the

00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,680
Democratic nomination and go on to be

00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,550
voted in as president the United States

00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:00,570
Facebook would find themselves on a

00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,160
lawsuit with the United States

00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:07,380
government burr overall would see them

00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:09,540
coming out as victorious situation

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,010
number two Elizabeth Warren decided to

00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:14,520
test the waters of Facebook's

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:16,590
advertising policies and paid for an ad

00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,360
that falsely advertises Zuckerberg had

00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:21,190
endorsed Trump for re-election

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,900
the verbage in the ad goes on to say

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:27,310
that the claim was false but the point

00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:30,130
absolutely had been made a few days

00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:31,630
after one's ad Zuckerberg gave a speech

00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,610
at Georgetown University where he

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:35,170
defended Facebook's actions about having

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,880
policies with policing speech on the

00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:42,280
platform embarrassingly he quoted dr.

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,260
Martin Luther King jr. which is the only

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:46,870
opinion I will give you about this

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,310
speech because whenever any sis wife man

00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,190
that could stop dear Martin Luther King

00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:52,780
jr. is usually miss quoting or selecting

00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:54,370
specific lines out of speeches in order

00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,770
to defend their apparent behavior

00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:58,780
because what better way to pacify people

00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:01,120
than having one of black America's

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:08,590
Heroes defend what you've done from the

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:11,190
grave yeah I know as of yesterday

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:14,440
Mark Zuckerberg privately recommended

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:17,350
that oh my god I'm gonna mess up this

00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,120
name Pete book dig tires for Pete's

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,980
presidential campaign according to the

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,290
article from Bloomberg written by Tyler

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:24,850
pager and Kurt Wagner and I asked we

00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,440
suggest you go read that article because

00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:30,070
it's not a lot of fluff it's nothing but

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,910
details about this space okay I'll hurry

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:36,340
up and it shows that there's a lot of

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,290
ties that these two have including that

00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,270
Pete was actually one of the original

00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,860
first 300 users of Facebook but

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,240
apparently they're trying to make it

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,560
like they weren't really friends but

00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,470
then how was he one of the first

00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:52,120
original 300 people with it okay moving

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,950
on okay so we're going to go back to the

00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,170
moral spectrum for a temperature check

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:58,000
with us remembering the five principles

00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,660
of ethics for the sake of this talk to

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,880
do no harm

00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,310
make things better respecting others to

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,530
be fair to care apply them to the

00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:07,360
aforementioned stereos and see where

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:09,460
they fall on the morality spectrum for

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,020
you it's interesting because even with

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,070
principles playing laid out the results

00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,660
are going to differ because the

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,180
definition of these can be subjective to

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,530
the individual the majority of the

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:19,420
situation I've presented you stem from

00:24:17,530 --> 00:24:21,880
companies wanting to remain apolitical

00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:24,130
yet having a definitive role in politics

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:28,960
at the same exact time I say that you

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:30,910
cannot do both you have to have the

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,360
business side you cannot have the

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,710
business that you had remain

00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,570
a political in the face of corruption

00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:37,540
are important policies yet use your

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,830
money and privilege to directly affect

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:43,600
politicals

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:43,600
standings just doesn't work those ways

00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:51,950
perfect so this is an expert that is

00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:53,420
pull directly from Perry Chris open

00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:56,299
letter that he posted to the chef blog

00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,540
when things first came to a head was

00:24:56,299 --> 00:25:01,610
chefs contract with ice feel free to

00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:03,350
read the letter in its entirety I pull

00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:05,270
this entire paragraph out of the letter

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,309
because I felt as though it was needed

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,650
to be said and I wanted to make an

00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:12,200
example out of this also notes that

00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:14,540
there I'm no waste bashing on chef and

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:16,820
I'm not bashing on the CEO I'm just

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:20,480
pulling this out as an example of things

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:22,549
not to do when things go wrong so I'll

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,870
read it while I understand that many of

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:25,700
you and many of our community members

00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:28,190
would prefer we had no business a

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,840
relationship with DHS ice I have made a

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,910
principled decision with the support of

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,169
the chef executive team to work with the

00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:34,790
institutions of our government

00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:35,960
regardless of whether or not we

00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:40,220
personally agree with their various

00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,440
policies I want to be clear that this

00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:44,059
decision is not about contract value it

00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,650
is about maintaining a consistent and

00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:50,330
fair business approach in these volatile

00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,799
times I would say that it when people

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,570
are deporting families and ripping

00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:56,360
children away from said families and

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,950
then adopting them out into families for

00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,380
that you never see their real families

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:07,280
ever again that fairness with them is no

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:10,130
longer an option so let me do this

00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,480
so I can see my perfect so ethics is

00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:13,130
knowing the difference between what you

00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,890
have a right to do and what is right to

00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:17,299
do this was said by Potter Stewart who

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:20,660
was an Associate Justice of the Supreme

00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:21,950
Court from 1958 to 1981 and also a judge

00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:25,640
that was a heavy advocate for civil

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:27,049
rights at some point we need to step

00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,290
away from our keyboards and ask

00:26:27,049 --> 00:26:31,850
ourselves when it is enough enough we as

00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:33,950
a collective cannot do the same when it

00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:36,230
comes to our industry an industry where

00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,270
we doderer selves on being says smart so

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,730
cunning so able to problem-solve and

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,260
ship these solutions to the world yet we

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:45,280
cannot come together to figure out for

00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,110
ourselves when is it enough

00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:49,000
different breed stagnation and that does

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,670
nothing good for anyone including

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,000
yourselves when do we stop sitting idly

00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:56,770
by what is your call to action is it

00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,540
innocent people being put in cages

00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,620
children being ripped away from their

00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,820
parents and being adopted right

00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,610
underneath their noses

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,370
children dying people's data being

00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:08,530
mishandled and misused active racial

00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,120
discrimination or is that not relevant

00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:13,930
to you because it's not happening to you

00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,310
or anyone that you know I'm not making -

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,400
not asking you to make a decision about

00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:21,100
your morality now but you need to do it

00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,150
soon I am asking you however to go

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:24,040
throughout the rest of the conference

00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,990
and in between talks and sessions to

00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,550
think about it we don't carry around a

00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,950
physical list of our code of ethics

00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:31,330
because we don't need to but luckily it

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,650
gave you a good list of principles as a

00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:35,440
starting point to help assess these

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,480
situations so start out with the things

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,220
that you strongly morally opposed or

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,720
perhaps strongly morally or four and

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:43,420
start applying them to the situation

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,520
that I've presented you today you don't

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,350
have to vocalize them or even tell me

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,390
about them but start filtering out the

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:52,120
situational aspects of the spectrum and

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,410
see where you will take a stand having a

00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,090
strong understanding of who we are as

00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,290
people is what is going to help us

00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,600
weather the storm that we are on the

00:27:56,290 --> 00:28:00,190
cusp of because the issues within our

00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,380
tech community are not are only going to

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:03,790
get bigger from here and sitting by and

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,380
letting the newspapers report with any

00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:09,130
sort of real action will only get us by

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,840
for so long with great power comes great

00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,670
responsibility and with great

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,810
responsibility comes the hard reality

00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:16,090
that we're not just writing code and

00:28:13,810 --> 00:28:18,220
never were we are no longer just hiding

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:20,950
away behind computer screen and making

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:22,600
what the companies tell us to do now

00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:23,950
more than ever we as employees of these

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,830
companies have the voice and the power

00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,960
to spur real change because hey we're

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,940
shareholders in these companies - but

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,070
beyond that we are humans we have

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:34,990
emotions hopes and dreams and we must

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:37,000
realize that we are contributing to them

00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:40,930
and we can make or break these things

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,400
for other humans as well so what will it

00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:43,510
take for you to face the truth that a

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,880
lot of the things that we're being

00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:48,940
worked on by us right now are not

00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,710
necessarily ethical not calling anyone a

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:52,810
bad person for working for a company

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,670
that has done bad things and absolutely

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,470
don't want this to be your takeaway we

00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:58,090
work these jobs for money first and

00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,659
foremost and unless we want to uproot

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,639
ourselves

00:28:58,659 --> 00:29:02,470
families sometimes the pickings are slim

00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:04,929
once we get to a certain level

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:06,429
however we as technologists need to

00:29:04,929 --> 00:29:07,899
recognize what profound privilege that

00:29:06,429 --> 00:29:09,539
we do have in discourse that is

00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:12,840
happening surrounding our industry today

00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:16,590
so I ask you what is your code of ethics

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,590
when will you take a stand

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:35,380
[Applause]

00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:35,380
