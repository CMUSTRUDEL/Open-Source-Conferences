Description: 
	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - Deduplicating an Organization by Jearvon Dharrie

There is a delicate balance between empowering teams with freedom of choice and empowering by removing undifferentiated lifting. In this talk, I will discuss how Comcast is building consensus around common technologies such as cloud, CI/CD and operational visibility. Topics that will be covered are, identifying where to consolidate, convincing engineers to change technologies and being open and transparent. Attendees of this talk will walk away with a view of our process. They will be able to take the solution or pieces of the solution and apply it to areas of their organization where consensus is needed such as diversity or office configuration.

[Music]

00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,990
all right so thanks for having me this

00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:23,509
talk is called deduplicating enterprise

00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,740
and no matter where I end on this talk

00:00:23,509 --> 00:00:30,619
hopefully you would have learned

00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:36,260
something so a little history this place

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:39,320
is called maheno a city in Pennsylvania

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,480
and it turns out that cable TV was first

00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,640
tried in Pennsylvania which I didn't

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,370
know so while working on this talk I

00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,249
decided to look up the history of cable

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:51,230
because I worked at a cable company to

00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:54,559
see the progress of technology in the

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:56,510
cable industry I was like ah cable let's

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,159
try it first in Pennsylvania according

00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:04,339
to Wikipedia so who knows if that's

00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:06,470
right so who remember is this when

00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:10,690
watching TV as a child all right so

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:15,410
these were like the bad old days when

00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:18,170
you know the guy was really slow we got

00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,390
this from a vendor or companies would

00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,090
get a guy from a vendor all their

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:27,440
software was built by a vendor and

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:29,060
changes wouldn't happen like there would

00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,160
be like one roll out a year or one roll

00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,520
out every six months so if there was a

00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:38,740
bug that you introduced at some point in

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,660
time good luck getting it fixed right so

00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,330
that was okay at that time right so for

00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:47,630
companies most large companies kind of

00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:49,520
have a similar story software wise you

00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,910
usually get there first I usually solve

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,220
something first where you go so quickly

00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:56,960
and then you become you get behind the

00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:59,120
curve right because software is moving

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,490
and it's constantly changing and the

00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:04,370
newer companies let's say like a newer

00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:06,530
streaming company gets to take advantage

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,959
of all the new Giddy's that are coming

00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,910
out like the public cloud or certain

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,340
types of new ways of thinking of

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,410
engineering but that doesn't mean that

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:20,230
your old enterprise or your current

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:22,159
enterprise can't go into that direction

00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,749
and then there's constantly this

00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:24,870
pendulum swinging back and forth right

00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:27,000
so there might be like

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:28,019
hey we want to do this new thing and

00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,989
then we realize that it's really

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,790
expensive and then Finance gets really

00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:33,930
scared and says we don't want to do that

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:35,580
anymore we're gonna go back to that

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:40,379
whole thing so how do you balance those

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:43,860
things so fast-forward I don't know how

00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,049
many years now we can talk to the TV and

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,489
this is the voice remote two iterations

00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:50,819
of it

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,950
and we kind of could consider ourselves

00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:55,560
I'm going nameless for a while and then

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,060
I'll introduce all who I work for

00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,730
so this is a voice remote you could talk

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,739
to the TV it has changed how you watch

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:04,109
TV like I cannot go to my parents house

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:05,459
and watch your TV because I have to

00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:09,209
browse all right I don't know what

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:11,720
channel things are on so we got there by

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:14,459
sort of reinventing ourselves right and

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,560
sort of becoming a tech company and the

00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:20,250
way that I would think of a our company

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,739
is like we moved to a new place let's

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,790
say we moved to like France and we sort

00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:25,200
of know the language and we could

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,720
communicate with people on a basic level

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,750
but we don't get the inside joke so we

00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,459
don't know where the cool spots are so

00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:39,329
that's where we want to go right to be

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:41,579
native native to the land so what does

00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,560
the talking so I called the talk I wrote

00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:45,120
this talk late at night and I thought I

00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,680
made up there were deduplication but it

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,730
turns out it's ER it's a real word and

00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,500
the summary of it means to eliminate

00:03:52,730 --> 00:04:00,780
redundant information and it's mostly

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:04,949
used in computer lands so like removing

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:08,220
redundant files or whatever right so

00:04:04,949 --> 00:04:10,590
what does the deduplicate mean in the

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,370
context of this talk and the context of

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,750
Comcast which is where I work so there

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,449
are like four or five things that I came

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,549
up with to sort of support this word or

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,820
define this word and the first thing is

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:25,590
we want to reduce the amount of

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,490
undifferentiated lifting that teams are

00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:32,340
doing so no longer do we want you to run

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:35,909
your own Cassandra clusters or your own

00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,910
CI CD platform like let's try to sort of

00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:42,690
bring those together and provide

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,920
common services where it makes sense so

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:46,350
at one point in time I mentioned that

00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,630
Comcast was very vendor heavy the

00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,450
pendulum swung to the other side where

00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:53,130
we gave everyone freedom to do what they

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,900
wanted all right so like each

00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:55,710
organization and each team got to make

00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,520
their decision

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:03,270
we also staff them very largely so they

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,760
can do whatever they want which turned

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,850
out not to be a good idea

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:12,110
so the pendulum is swinging back right

00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:15,630
so during that journey we realized that

00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:18,090
folks making their own choices is very

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:20,070
important and it makes them happy and it

00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,780
makes them do their best work so we

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,120
still want to provide like common

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,150
platforms where it makes sense but still

00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,520
allow them to have that freedom of

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:33,030
choice so maybe instead of forcing them

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,170
to use one technology we support them to

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,360
say hey like this is what you should

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,450
strive for when you're looking for free

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,130
technology all right so as I mentioned

00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,630
like right now there are multiple if you

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:44,400
go to a conference maybe this conference

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,730
there are probably vendors here and we

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,780
probably use all of them so we want to

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:54,080
reduce the amount of of churn and

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:56,670
technology choice where it makes sense

00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,630
the other thing we want to do is sort of

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:02,280
provide like a path for teams to to go

00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,570
make a decision right so like let's say

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,950
you are researching a queueing system

00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:09,930
hopefully there's like some document or

00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:14,640
someone has published their findings

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,370
about queueing systems XY and Z and you

00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:19,500
don't have to start from zero you can

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,750
start at some base level that everyone

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,080
has access to you can read the cons and

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:26,790
the pros that someone went through and

00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,080
start at a higher level and then focus

00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:30,540
on what you really need to focus on

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,640
which is the business part of things we

00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,200
don't improve developer experience so

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,490
let's say firewalls everyone struggles

00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,440
with firewalls that their company is

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:41,280
probably probably not like an eager

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:45,060
start-up or creating a new AWS account

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,250
like how do we improve that process and

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,680
thinking about that the other thing is

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,360
we want to take advantage of our scale

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,780
so we have lots of developers

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:58,020
who are very talented so let's say like

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:02,669
we have a large Python usage story how

00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:04,979
can we come across or come up with like

00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:07,470
a Python stack that makes sense for most

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:09,449
cases that we would have a good

00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:12,449
knowledge base for us so like a good

00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:14,930
HTTP library or a good framework so

00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,070
folks to get started on their project

00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:19,410
start working on the business part of

00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:23,610
the project and deliver that faster to

00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:25,260
the consumer and the other thing is just

00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,060
we just want to reduce friction overall

00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:31,710
because we're all developers at one time

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,419
we all faced the problems that we're we

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,139
were trying to fix so we want to make it

00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:39,630
better so why do we want to do this

00:07:37,139 --> 00:07:42,380
right so I mentioned earlier we have

00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:46,169
cool products now we're making money

00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:47,280
we're pretty reliable some people still

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:51,180
like us some people still don't like

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,400
this that's a hard thing to fix and

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,690
we're constantly evolving so why do we

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,419
want to do this why do we want to change

00:07:54,690 --> 00:08:00,210
things and get away from what we're

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,190
doing because we believe in continuous

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:05,729
improvement it's a huge part of our

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:07,889
culture or currently it is anyway has

00:08:05,729 --> 00:08:10,220
become that so we're always trying to

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:15,300
think what can we do better

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:18,030
to deliver more value to the customer so

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,599
whether that means like adding features

00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:23,190
to your Wi-Fi which you might have heard

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,169
in the commercials like X Y it's no

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,690
longer Wi-Fi we're making the voice

00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:29,099
remote better so being able to like

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,810
deliver those features quicker to

00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,260
customers and deliver more of them in

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:36,719
the year we want to improve quality of

00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,770
our services so you might see online

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,659
that people are complaining about

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:41,459
outages or whatnot so like how do we get

00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,979
around those things how do we catch them

00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,020
before the customer sees them

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:50,160
we want to operate cheaper right so make

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,900
our products run more efficiently so we

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:56,209
can invest that money in either more

00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:59,700
products or into our employees or to our

00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:01,490
customer base and then going back to

00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,560
like where we started like in the 1960s

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,620
to now

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,090
you've bought a lot of companies we've

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:10,640
also integrated with a lot of companies

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:13,010
so you can imagine that

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,529
Comcast and the larger Comcast NBC

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:17,690
Universal is a very complex machine

00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:20,480
right like to figure out like where

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,710
something is going wrong or overtime

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,390
like people have just like built things

00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:29,690
and taken their architects word for it

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:34,430
that it should work and no more

00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:36,800
architects so this talk is mostly about

00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,910
that journey all right so I'm going to

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,140
talk about some of the things that we've

00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,400
been doing I'm gonna bring us through

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,370
some of them and hopefully spend some

00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,620
time with some others about how we're

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:47,570
doing that how we are trying to

00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,700
continuously improve ourselves the first

00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,710
thing that I needed to happen was

00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,930
leadership needed to recognize that this

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:55,279
was useful right so either you get all

00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:58,790
of them to read the accelerate book

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,830
which is very popular now or some book

00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:02,510
that they read somewhere or someone gave

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:06,620
a good talk that they went to and

00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:10,610
recognized that also no one laughed at

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,860
that joke but we had to admit that this

00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,589
is important and it wasn't it was not

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,900
only for like making developers happy

00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:20,330
like these things had direct business

00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:21,020
impact so we have to get everyone in the

00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,330
same page

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,360
so everyone paddling to the same same

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,730
island because it doesn't make sense if

00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,320
one org is doing something counter to

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:33,920
the other because then we're just

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,150
fighting against each other so we need

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,089
to make sure that it's part of our

00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:40,640
conversation every day and it's part of

00:10:38,089 --> 00:10:43,339
our principles so we're working to us as

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,640
constantly the next thing that we did is

00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:49,430
invested right an example of investing

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,990
in engineering is this building if you

00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,959
haven't visited this building I could

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:56,720
totally give you a tour at some point

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:58,490
and this building was built for just the

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,690
engineers right and as corny as that

00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:02,720
sounds

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,990
actly has had an impact on us based on

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,430
our like our collaboration on a design

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:09,680
of the building

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,950
turns out open spaces are bad but

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,370
they're also good so next thing we did

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:20,480
is identify the areas

00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:22,650
so looking at across the organization

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,350
what are the areas that we should focus

00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,770
on what are our weaknesses

00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,840
that we should go work on to improve the

00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,580
maturity and the capabilities of the

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,560
company so this is we call this the

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:36,930
software strategy and this is a living

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,790
document that changes over time so based

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,420
on the needs of the industry or the

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,370
needs of the company this is allowed to

00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,020
change but it's this document that you

00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:49,590
can go and refer to anyone in the

00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:53,040
company go read it and understand like

00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,990
where we're going and what are Comcast's

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,100
thoughts on software delivery and

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:01,290
billing software so initially and so far

00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:04,020
we've come up with five themes and the

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,790
five themes are we want to accelerate so

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,670
accelerating your delivery to production

00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,440
or your delivery or accelerating a

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,460
bug-fix to production and just moving

00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:16,680
faster right but safely so maybe that

00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:19,230
means using higher level services in the

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,390
public cloud we want to be cheaper and

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,680
be more cost efficient there's a time

00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,050
where we she lived engineers from

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,700
finance but we want to change that so

00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:28,440
how could we get engineering involved in

00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,750
finance and educate them about some of

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,310
these topics so they can make informed

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:37,220
decisions about what their they're doing

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,840
going back to the complex system thing

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:42,840
we want to reduce our complexity right

00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,440
so we want to run less infrastructure or

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,300
run let be responsible for less services

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,700
and then improving our quality so doing

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:52,170
things like our budgets and the last one

00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:54,360
is leaning into open source so whether

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,020
that be using open source or giving back

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,580
to open source

00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,780
we're just publishing our own open

00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:03,330
source libraries so the next thing we

00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,950
did is form a team around this this is

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:06,120
not the actual these are this is a

00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:09,330
larger department but I don't have a

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,100
picture of just a team so that's another

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:14,580
example of investing right so hiring a

00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:17,430
group of people that are skilled in this

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:20,910
area of changing an organization at

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:24,960
large to do this and then I'm part of

00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:26,850
that team and my official title is

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,560
developer advocate which people are

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,250
usually surprised about like Comcast

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,270
having a

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:36,060
advocate so what do we do we just go

00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:38,310
around talking about the mission we try

00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,810
to collaborate with people because

00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:43,860
there's only a few of us I think there

00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:45,750
are four or five of us now so we can't

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,090
scale to the size of Comcast's so we

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:51,660
have to figure out clever ways to sort

00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:53,490
of get things out of our brains or scale

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,590
our efforts all right so the first

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,480
things that we do is work with with the

00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,300
less mature teams or less capable teams

00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,050
and sort of bridge those gaps that might

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,720
be missing for them so let's say that

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:10,290
they are just moving to some public

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,510
cloud and they're not aware of like the

00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:15,320
security rules in there so working with

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:17,850
them and bringing security along and

00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,770
helping out helping them out that way

00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,320
the other thing that we do is try to

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:23,910
find high-performing teams in the

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,460
company so who are teams that are

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,070
already doing continuous delivery or

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:31,110
really good I mean you're testing I sort

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,300
of encouraged him to you know give

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:37,710
internal talks give Brownback's and

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:39,870
publish your work somewhere so then

00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:42,839
folks to go reference that and sort of

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,780
like plug in summary of their tactics

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:47,700
now the other thing as we try to form

00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:50,970
virtual orgs so this is a picture of us

00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:53,730
at dinner comcast has Center at cloud

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,000
Center of Excellence also another

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,760
coining term but we needed a name and

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,960
the industry got a name for us so this

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,839
is a cross-cutting team across

00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,210
organizations that has security folks in

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,330
their network folks in it and software

00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,650
architecture which is my group so when

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,560
we approach a problem we approach it

00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:17,220
from all with all lenses in the room and

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:20,370
from making sure that all of us are

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,420
supported and things are getting done

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,589
with the right principles and mindset

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:26,640
the other thing my team started doing

00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:30,000
this year is billing reference

00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,520
implementations so basically like a

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,220
reference app that's usable so our

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:38,430
current reference application is our lab

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:41,010
week portal our lab week is just a week

00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:42,620
three weeks out of the year that Comcast

00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:46,250
employees get to

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,800
work whatever they want to so usually

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,440
pitch an idea and you submit it through

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,360
the portal so we took up the work on the

00:15:51,440 --> 00:16:00,410
portal and started integrating our best

00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:02,060
practices into that so you know we may

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,430
be containers are a part of our strategy

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,980
so deploying the app onto like something

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,650
like ECS so a team could go reference

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,140
the application maybe not pick up the

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,050
codebase and adopt the full ECS stuff

00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:16,760
let's just see how how it works it also

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:19,430
allows us to experience some of the pain

00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,000
points in the company so like how do you

00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:26,720
get connectivity back to on-premise from

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:30,290
the public cloud and it also allows us

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,150
to extract learnings rights or maybe

00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:35,470
writing a blog post or publishing a

00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,610
tariff or module from from the project

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:41,150
the other thing that we've been doing is

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:43,730
recording our thoughts and this is good

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,260
because it because it prevents you from

00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:49,070
repeating yourself over and over right

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:51,650
so like the one that comes to mind for

00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,210
us is we have a cloud strategy which is

00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:55,790
basically a decision framework of when

00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:58,730
to use which cloud whether it be private

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,500
or public and folks to go read this

00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:02,210
document and basically go through the

00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,830
flow and this is like it's like a

00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:08,210
document with a a bunch of ifs right

00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:10,010
analysis and we were super happy one day

00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:12,490
and realized that this is paying off

00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:16,340
when we saw saw being shared and slack

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:18,170
someone asked about you know the cloud

00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:23,390
and which cloud to use and someone

00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:25,010
shared it without us doing that and the

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:30,620
one that I want to get into today is

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:33,190
architecture gills so this has a link to

00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:36,470
an info key article that my password

00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:40,070
that goes into this in much deeper

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:44,560
fashion but this has had a lot of

00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:46,760
success for us so this is our framework

00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:51,230
like sort of cobbled together with a

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:55,300
bunch of things that facilitates forming

00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:58,630
consensus across the company right so

00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,870
at any level of team it's mostly

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:06,970
happening at the organization was like

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:10,900
off engineering to come to a conclusion

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,940
on some problem or come to a conclusion

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,740
for a solution for some problem that

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:19,870
we're facing so how does it work

00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:23,590
so it's modeled after some of the

00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:29,530
standard body stuff so after the IETF

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:31,350
and also this concept called ABR's which

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,420
I have a link to later

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,910
so first someone has to think up a

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,530
problem or face a problem or many people

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,660
have to face the problem or maybe just

00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,830
the organization thinks of a problem and

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:44,410
they have to write this thing called a

00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,630
charter and a charter is just a fancy

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,250
word for saying the scope of this

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,680
working group and what is it gonna solve

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:54,250
alright so this is the first one that we

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:57,160
did which is source control or for

00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:58,870
source control and basically came to the

00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,060
conclusion that we should have

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:03,130
enterprise it was an easy one because we

00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:05,740
were already using it have Enterprise at

00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,570
scale but it was just to try out the

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:11,530
formula and see how it work and see how

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:13,240
we would do with this right so I don't

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:15,100
know if you could see that but it just

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,080
says the scope of this working group is

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,030
targeted to version control and it also

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,490
has things that we won't talk about

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:26,200
which are out of scope continuous

00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:28,180
integration right so that's for another

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,770
one so the next thing that we do is we

00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,900
announce this right so we have an

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,390
architecture channel with I don't know

00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:37,390
maybe like a thousand people on it one

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:41,170
more and then each working group gets

00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:43,210
its own slack channel that starts with

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,560
the name arch - W so if someone were to

00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,180
enjoying the company for the first time

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,730
and they wanted to see all the working

00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:50,650
groups they could just type our - W and

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,660
see them the reason that we emphasize

00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,250
and slack so much and not in person

00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:56,350
meetings is because the company is

00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:58,780
distributed and we don't want anyone to

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,970
like miss out because they can make a

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:03,910
meeting or they live somewhere else but

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,790
if everything's happens over slack and

00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:08,170
github

00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:09,340
we make sure that it's documented and

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:10,690
they can go back and see the pull

00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,580
request and see the thought process

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,630
behind something all right and then we

00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:18,820
have a mailing list with all the

00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:21,580
engineers ten minutes okay cool I should

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,860
be done that it also gets mailed out to

00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,510
and then we recruit two or three

00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:28,030
co-chairs and these co-chairs are not

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:31,450
maybe not people that are versed in the

00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:34,090
topic but they are good at communication

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,520
it turns out that communication is very

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:37,210
important and it's not all about

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,190
engineering

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,570
all right because engineering or

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,679
engineers tend to be a mean sometimes or

00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:46,090
they really want their solution to be

00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:49,150
picked but if there's someone that's

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:52,780
scared that's sort of like guiding folks

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,940
and keeping like some code of conduct

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,510
into place those people are super

00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:00,700
valuable so the format that we that we

00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,160
picked for sort of stating the solution

00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,559
is the as an AVR and you can read more

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:08,140
about what AVR is at this article by

00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:10,150
Michael Nygaard and the format of the

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:13,390
ADR is just these four things

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:16,030
so there's context so what the context

00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:19,809
is what information did you think about

00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:21,580
while making this decision the actual

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:25,179
decision so whether or not you picked

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:27,790
like spoink for your for your login the

00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:31,750
rationale behind it so like why did you

00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:32,230
do this what did you check things of

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,390
that nature

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:36,010
and then the consequences so not

00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,110
everything is perfect right we all know

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,820
this and if someone publishes an ADR

00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:44,620
without any consequences then they're

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:47,200
lying to you so there must be some

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:48,510
drawbacks because not every solution is

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,840
perfect

00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:56,320
and then the person submits that

00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,510
solutions that solution and the solution

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,490
has to be something that's kind of

00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:03,059
already running in production right it's

00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,350
not something that we have to go by oh

00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:07,440
we already have to have a license for it

00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,179
some set of people already have to have

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,500
experience in the company for it because

00:22:10,179 --> 00:22:13,690
then you get into this way to stay where

00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:14,950
you recommended something and you want

00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:16,660
to use it as a solution but you have to

00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,860
wait for it to be built or to be

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:22,030
procured

00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:23,410
and that's not buying us any value but

00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,910
over time like these things are not set

00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,970
in stone right we can go back and change

00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:31,929
them we tried to like keep ourselves

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:35,530
very nimble for because we know that

00:22:31,929 --> 00:22:37,210
change change is gonna come and keeping

00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,110
ourselves nimble does not mean that we

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:42,910
are afraid of vendor lock-in by the way

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:46,210
and then we come to consensus on this

00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:49,090
right so imagine a large organization

00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:51,340
trying to come to consensus on one thing

00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,540
so the first ones were easy like the

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,690
source control because there was like

00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:58,150
only one solution that people picked but

00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:59,650
we did one for C ICD and you could

00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:04,960
imagine that everyone has their favorite

00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:08,950
C ICD solution so we had to come up with

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:11,530
new ways of folding and sort of weeding

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:14,980
reading down the projects as they go one

00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:16,510
thing that we noticed with the CSC d1 is

00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,830
people would like throw out an option

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,020
but they didn't want to give any effort

00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,240
into writing the ADR so then that

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,590
allowed us to immediately like zap them

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,299
because they want to put effort like

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:27,010
even if it was good if you're not

00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:29,350
willing to like justify why you want to

00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:33,940
use it then doesn't make sense for us

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:35,559
all right the other thing of when we're

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,870
coming to consensus and we've picked a

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:43,059
solution we want to make sure that we

00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:44,890
capture the areas that the solution

00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,630
doesn't cover so either we go back and

00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:49,690
fix them or we go back and contribute

00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:54,190
them or you ask we think we address them

00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:56,440
it in in some fashion so some solutions

00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,690
that we've picked so far the team is

00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,210
only like a year and a half or maybe two

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:03,850
years or this this initiative we've

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:06,760
picked source control which I showed you

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:12,090
we pick the C ICD platform which is

00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:15,700
concourse yay yeah MO and we have a

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:20,230
observability stack that we're currently

00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:20,799
working on with with a bunch of tools

00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,580
together

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,080
I guess it's good to mention that the

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,790
solution doesn't need to be one tool it

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,790
could be a combination lot of tooling

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,910
so what are some learnings from this

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:39,150
exercise I mentioned communication

00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:40,440
earlier and also marketing you have to

00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,820
be good at marketing so you have to like

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,870
get your ideas out there

00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,760
you'll make people aware of the gills

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:50,130
and make people aware of the initiatives

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,720
like sometimes even though I think I'm

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,730
doing a good job I got go to a different

00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:56,040
office and people have no idea what I'm

00:24:53,730 --> 00:25:00,090
talking about and that just means that

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,230
like I failed at my job but it almost

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,150
feels like we should hire marketing

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,660
department just for this stuff right or

00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:09,150
a communications department sometimes

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:11,790
you need to require a change I know that

00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,530
the company really believes in not

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:16,110
requiring something to happen like it

00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:22,230
should happen organically but sometimes

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:24,270
people just can't come together and then

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:25,980
sometimes folks are resistance because

00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,880
resistant because they just want to be

00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:31,920
heard so this just means that people

00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,860
might seem like they don't want to adopt

00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,940
the thing that you're recommending but

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,590
that's because you're not listening to

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:40,380
them right so they don't necessarily

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,760
want to have their thing adopted or

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,280
there there's a version of the solution

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,140
but they want to you to listen to how

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,559
they use the tool that they're currently

00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:52,400
using and help them figure out how to do

00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:55,500
that workflow and in the current tool

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,000
working groups can inform each other so

00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,250
the order of working groups can matter

00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,410
right so for the source control working

00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,960
group we one of the recommendations that

00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:06,030
we had was a branching strategy which is

00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,410
informs some of the stuff that we doing

00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:14,220
with CI CD I don't really have a lot of

00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:17,730
summary but think about how to cleverly

00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:21,360
scale scale yourself you need to

00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:25,650
collaborate with people right and then I

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,650
guess your organization even though it

00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:30,780
might be a big organization and it seems

00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:32,790
like change can't happen

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,400
change will happen it's just a very slow

00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:37,559
process I think that's that's been the

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,000
biggest learning for me likes just

00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,910
learning patience right like I just

00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,769
can't say hey everyone I'm like stop

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:46,480
like you should deploy more and

00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:51,970
they'll do it right because that could

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:54,190
cause all types of problems so patients

00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:56,679
saying things over and over being ready

00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:58,630
for something when catastrophes happen

00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,490
so let's say the company is suffering

00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:01,899
from a problem and no one has been

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:05,230
listening to you just keep that in your

00:27:01,899 --> 00:27:07,419
back pocket for when you're like oh like

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:12,580
you know like you can do safer deploys

00:27:07,419 --> 00:27:15,010
doing this this solution and then that's

00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:17,830
it so if you have any questions I can

00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:22,210
take a few if I have time also my team

00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:23,649
is hiring if this interests you if you

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:27,299
think this is completely wrong and you

00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:27,299
want to change how it's done

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:46,599
[Applause]
