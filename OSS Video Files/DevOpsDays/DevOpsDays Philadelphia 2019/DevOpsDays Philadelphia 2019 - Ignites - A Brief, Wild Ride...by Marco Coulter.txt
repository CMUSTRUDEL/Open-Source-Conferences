Description: 
	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - Ignites - A Brief, Wild Ride Around Quantum Computing by Marco Coulter

A mathematician, a data scientist, a computer scientist and a physicist walk into a room sounds like the start of a joke. It is actually the average quantum computing (QC) meetup. Gartner warned executives to consider hiring PHDâ€™s even though many will not use QC for possibly a decade. QC is already helping classical computing with improved algorithms, so we should be aware of what QC is and where it can be useful today.

00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,779
any just before you hit play any

00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:24,169
theoretical physicists in the room

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:27,020
seriously awesome let's catch up later

00:00:24,169 --> 00:00:28,340
are you again like my apology before

00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:30,680
matrimony you will hate some of my

00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,239
simplifications here but never mind we

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,280
do there is a quantum meetup that

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,290
happens in New York City once a month

00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,000
people come up from Philly for it so

00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:41,230
please like search for that on Meetup

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,190
and come on and join quantum physicists

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,899
theoretical physicist electrical

00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:49,010
engineers and computer scientists in one

00:00:44,899 --> 00:00:51,980
room so did you hit play I did ticktick

00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,949
I'm good already okay you know me that's

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,559
me kind of thing and what I want to try

00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:00,170
to do in the next however long this is

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:01,760
because we just edited it before is get

00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:05,630
you excited about quantum computing and

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,490
where it is the where it is today is

00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:10,790
sort of like we're high school computing

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,960
was I guess back in the 30s to 60s where

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,700
they were building machines that are

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,620
unreliable so if you look at the

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,600
timeline here quantum physics so quantum

00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,790
mechanics started back in about 1901

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,550
when Planck worked out that energy was

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,590
quantized it became stayed in the realm

00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,260
of the theoretical physicists until

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,490
about 1980 when Benioff and Feynman came

00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:30,470
along and said hey we could use that for

00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:31,640
computing when you see a quantum

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,170
computer you'll normally see a photo

00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:35,180
like this this is a naked quantum

00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,530
computer not-safe-for-work what you're

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,720
actually looking at here is is a

00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:41,240
distillation refrigerator sorry a

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,740
dilution refrigerator so all of the gold

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,810
and pretty stuff you're seeing there is

00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,270
actually just about getting a tiny thing

00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,640
this thing a qubit a chip at the bottom

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,340
of that whole connection down to 15 Mele

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,680
clock milli kelvins that's colder than

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,880
deep space and you won't be able to get

00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,680
this in your laptop or your phone

00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,270
because of all that refrigeration

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,580
requirements so you're always going to

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:03,140
see a quantum computer as a sidecar

00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,430
to how you're running your regular

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,960
classical computing and by the way

00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:07,149
everything that we have our jobs in and

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:10,700
everything today has now become

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:12,620
classical computing alright what got me

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,450
hooked on QC I met a French guy at a

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:16,220
conference in Germany and he drew this

00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,110
block to fear for me and I thought he

00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,959
was drawing an atom but in fact it's a

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,150
it's a sphere of pot of potential values

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,040
and I've talked about this enough to my

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,260
friends that last Christmas my

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,970
brought me this t-shirt in order to try

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,500
and get me to shut up right and to stop

00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,430
talking about it so I apologize but I

00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,709
really love this stuff

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,019
superposition is a very cool thing I put

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:38,360
it on two slides to cheat a bit

00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:40,400
superposition is how you can how a

00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,650
particle can be in two places at the

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,329
same time and can even interfere with

00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,019
itself being in a different place at the

00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:47,120
same time

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,310
sounds crazy run with me what that means

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,140
is that our qubit can not only have a

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,220
value of zero one it can have a value of

00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:56,920
zero and one at the same time and that

00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,730
allows massive parallel processing

00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,769
entanglement is something that even

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,150
Einstein described as spooky and that's

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:03,980
the nature that you can take two

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,069
particles and entangle them and then

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,359
separate them and they remain entangled

00:03:06,069 --> 00:03:10,700
despite the intervening space and we

00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:13,459
have proved this how do you code for

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,799
computers in quantum computers well one

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,139
example is this circuit example from IBM

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,959
has a public space so you can go and run

00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:22,400
your code on quantum computers and if

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,829
that isn't cool enough to get to a free

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
drink in a bar I don't know what is the

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:29,030
second exam what I like about the visual

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,410
example is that it lets you realize that

00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,319
you're actually kind of creating the

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:35,540
chip designing the chip to match your

00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,650
challenge so it's a little different

00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,349
from how we think about coding today

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:41,299
because it's such days in this area but

00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:44,449
don't fear there are kids chris credits

00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:47,480
the IBM example that we can use to write

00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:52,430
quantum code and be in a more familiar

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,870
environment an IDE for ourselves the

00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:56,030
challenge with quantum computing today

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,709
is mostly around errors it's getting

00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,120
these particles to cohere and stay in

00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:00,769
coherence because when you actually

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,129
interfere with them you change the

00:04:00,769 --> 00:04:05,510
energy level and they lose coherence why

00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:07,280
people paying attention to quantum

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,940
computing see the numbers in the middle

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,799
there the 28th with lots of zeroes

00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,780
theoretically a calculation certain

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,519
parallel calculations on quantum

00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,289
computers that might take thousands and

00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:19,789
thousands of years can be done in

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:22,039
seconds on quantum computers and we have

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,889
established this industries that are

00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:25,909
looking at this pharmaceutical companies

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,800
are looking at it for molecular

00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:29,930
structure Volkswagen has a heavy

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,639
investment in flow mechanics they also

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,919
have a heavy investment in logistics

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:35,630
most of the major finance companies in

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,200
New York City are investing in quantum

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:37,760
computing

00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,270
because they say improving on their

00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:44,450
algorithms Cisco our parent company is

00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,220
investing in the crypto code there are

00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,710
real-world benefits and this is the

00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,750
takeaway if your job entitles you and

00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:54,050
entails you creating or updating

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,210
algorithms in your job today you should

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,130
be watching quantum computing because as

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,680
they tuning algorithms to run on these

00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,090
crazy error-prone quantum computers that

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,280
are improving the algorithms and that

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:05,600
last example we're in a hospital they

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,010
sort of tune these algorithms and

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,600
quantum computers worked out that they

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,910
were much more accurate as well we're

00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,710
running on classical computers what's

00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:14,150
the future here quantum mobius at a side

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,970
car like a graphics card or something

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,100
like that except extremely big and the

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,080
impact of this is that there's a lot of

00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,660
competition for PhDs colleges and

00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:25,400
universities they're complaining because

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,860
businesses are hiring out the PhDs

00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,660
for when quantum computing kicks in so

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,250
as I say if you're creating or managing

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:33,170
out creating or updating algorithms

00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,730
today have a look at this space there's

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:36,140
a bunch of links here take a quick photo

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,240
of it or something like that but quantum

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,250
weakly is a good place to start just to

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,260
get a your finger on the pulse of okay

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,150
what are people talking about and like

00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,680
me you know I spent about a year just

00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,650
trying to get my head around well how

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,890
can a bit be both 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 at the

00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,730
same time enjoy thank you thank you
