Description: 
	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - AIOps Is How We Will Survive DevOps by Marco Coulter

Guessing alert threshold settings, coping with event storms, and scanning logs for root cause analysis at 2am is inefficient and soul-crushing. This session uses Marco’s experiences to give a reality-check on AI/ML, list what DevOps missed out on, and why he sees AIOps as the natural next step.

DevOps took us from SysAdmins to DeployAdmins to improve availability but came with a tidal wave of tools and environments, leaving detecting anomalies and finding root cause a task for the overcrowded war-room of siloed experts. Developers need to understand infrastructure, and operations needs to understand the SDLC. The good news is we can help each other! To understand why you need AIOps to survive DevOps, I need to level set on the myth and reality of machine learning today. Then we can examine what tends to get overlooked by DevOps approaches. Finally, let’s agree on what AIOps is and where it has helped best so far with use cases.

[Music]

00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:20,810
okay g'day my name is Marco Coulter my

00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:23,689
first DevOps day conference was here in

00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:26,390
Philly a year ago and I was so impressed

00:00:23,689 --> 00:00:28,099
at the content and the interactions that

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,649
I saw that I knew I wanted to come back

00:00:28,099 --> 00:00:32,720
and speak this year and thank you for

00:00:30,649 --> 00:00:34,790
you know thank you to the organizers who

00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:36,350
have allowed me to speak this time and

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,450
also thank you for the next 30 minutes

00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:42,260
of your life I'm going to talk about AI

00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,649
ops who's using AI ops today all right

00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:47,570
one person that sounds about right

00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,280
we're functioning on DevOps we're doing

00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,980
good things with DevOps it's been a

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,839
great process for us but it helped us

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:57,170
get through agile computing it helped us

00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:58,699
keep the performance deliverables of our

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:01,280
companies and enterprises that we needed

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:02,780
what we need to do is you know we're now

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,699
under a lot of stress we've introduced a

00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:08,180
lot of tools and complexity from taking

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:09,800
on the challenge of DevOps and you know

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,180
I remember from the sessions here last

00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,850
year and some of the sessions on the

00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,130
list today that you know we're all under

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,200
a lot of stress and pressure on now

00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,120
under the pressure to try and share a I

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,250
ops with you in the next within 30

00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,510
minutes and I would normally take about

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,890
90 I'll try and be good so I want to ask

00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,270
you a question I'm going to ask some

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,650
questions on the way through so make

00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:34,310
sure your arms the limiter put your arms

00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,860
up at the right points this is me I'm

00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,300
Marco Coulter I'm an immigrant and a

00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,560
global citizens I've lived in three

00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,870
countries

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,180
I've managed teams in 11 countries and

00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,850
so far I visited 35 countries out of

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:48,590
about a hundred and ten that exists I

00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:50,600
like exploring the world Mike life has

00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:52,850
given me that opportunity I've been on

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,800
all sides of IT so I have run data

00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:57,350
centers I've been an operator and fed

00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,350
checks into machines I have been a

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,000
developer coding mainly in assembler I

00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,770
have run development teams on the

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,810
product side of the industry and I've

00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,220
been an industry analyst at a company

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,750
called for five on research for about

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:12,739
five years where I ran the data science

00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:14,720
organizations out of all that the thing

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,010
that most in piece impacts me I'm now in

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,120
New York oh you'll pick it up a little

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,620
bit of my attitude if not the accent and

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,180
in the the thing I love about New York

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,790
though is I have a little outdoor space

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,470
and growing vegetables out there

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,689
vegetables and things that I can eat to

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,340
grow in New York is a passion so don't

00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:34,989
ask me about it during a break because I

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:36,549
will Bend your ears I want you to look

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,439
at these four statements and think which

00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:39,849
of these four quotes best match you I'm

00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:41,799
not gonna ask you to put up your hands

00:02:39,849 --> 00:02:43,329
and I apologize the camera person I'm a

00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:46,090
walker sorry I'm gonna be all over your

00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:47,560
screen all right which of these four

00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:49,060
things best match your current

00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,500
environment the applications you're

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,900
responsible for the enterprise you're

00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,069
running do you just react to things and

00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:56,940
then move on after you know a

00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,590
performance or an outage happens

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,650
are you proactive that at least at the

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,450
end when you've solved the problem

00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,889
usually then hold a post-mortem and try

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,540
and work out something so it may not

00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:08,709
happen again

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,260
are you predictive that you're actually

00:03:08,709 --> 00:03:12,909
seeing it before the customer does that

00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,500
you're seeing the performance and

00:03:12,909 --> 00:03:17,200
slowdowns going on in your environment

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:19,329
before you know somebody phones you up

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,620
and tells you about it and then the

00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:22,269
fourth one here is about being

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,250
pre-emptive where you're not necessarily

00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,959
thinking about their environment because

00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,500
you've got the time to focus on getting

00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,790
the code right before it even goes in so

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,250
allows you to think of where you were

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,239
today and we asked enterprises

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,760
AppDynamics

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,760
is part of Cisco our parent company

00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:43,139
Cisco ran research across thousands of

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,069
enterprises in the end of last year and

00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,569
what they identified was where people

00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,239
were today and you can see that most

00:03:46,569 --> 00:03:52,030
people today self-identify as being

00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:53,379
proactive though don't it'll walk away

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,480
from something once they've fixed it

00:03:53,379 --> 00:03:57,040
they don't address it but what they see

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:00,190
what was interesting is that in two

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,949
years time the per a Leticia themselves

00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:04,389
as predictive and pre-emptive and if you

00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:07,359
think of the workload you have right now

00:04:04,389 --> 00:04:08,859
and how you're managing your DevOps if

00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:10,180
you've got DevOps in your environment

00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:11,470
how you're managing that environment or

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,970
if you're an SRE site reliability

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,980
engineer how you're managing your

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,799
environments you're going to need help

00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,180
to get there all of the conveyor meant

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,650
that we have and the application

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,370
environment running has become more

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,050
complex and we need to augment ourselves

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,000
with technology as we have tried to do

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,860
in the past so this is a quick

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,530
presentation in four chapters right I'm

00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,380
going to talk a little bit about one of

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,229
the issues that I have with the DevOps

00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,440
and then talk about machine learning and

00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:41,320
what

00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:43,240
that really is who's run tensorflow or

00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,360
some sort of a trainer machine learning

00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:50,560
models okay so not bad about ten people

00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,710
out of the room I'll go through a quick

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,300
little sort of explanation of how

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,770
machine learning actually works then

00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,420
we'll talk about what AI Ops is and the

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,220
benefits why you would want to embrace

00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:02,290
this in your environment what you will

00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,730
get from embracing it and then the next

00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,500
question people normally have is what do

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,290
I automate so I have some criteria there

00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,630
to help you work out what to automate so

00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,010
let's start with surviving DevOps this

00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:14,080
visual you know we've seen this graphic

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:16,690
a lot in the DevOps environment at the

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,970
DevOps ribbon or the Ouroboros snake

00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,770
eating itself I have one problem with

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,050
this this is a great visualization of

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:25,390
what needed to happen to get into this

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:28,750
sort of continuous environment but it

00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:30,280
didn't really account for time so when I

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,580
as a developer for the Common World Bank

00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,040
in Australia I they asked me to write an

00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,140
interest calculation module it needed to

00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,450
be really fast really efficient and so

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,680
they asked me to code it in assembler so

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:45,130
I wrote that it took me about two months

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,720
to write that code right and and it was

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,830
beautiful

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,450
released I thought it was but it tested

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:51,940
okay and I didn't fail and things like

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:53,880
that and we put it in play and it was

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,650
used by lots of different applications

00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,000
about two years later I moved on in my

00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,640
career and I left the Commonwealth Bank

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,950
and they were still using that module it

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:04,419
hadn't been touched but a friend of mine

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,940
stayed there and they were there for

00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:08,380
nine years and in nine years before they

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,120
left I phoned him up and asked him to

00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:12,730
look and they were still using the same

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,650
module so something that only took me

00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:19,240
about two months to write two months of

00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:21,040
plan plan code build test release lasted

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,660
for nine years in an environment and

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,090
that's why I sort of challenged the

00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,710
DevOps ribbon are saying these things

00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:28,540
are important and if you'll get

00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,950
importance that works but when you look

00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:32,680
at the lifespan of things and where

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,840
effort goes in time and monitoring after

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,669
the time then it doesn't reflect that as

00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:38,320
well I don't necessarily have a better

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:41,800
idea but I just didn't necessarily like

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,960
that it ignored monitoring didn't ignore

00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,090
it but it sort of pepper didn't get

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,580
monitoring sufficient lifespan

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,560
so who's this is a hands up question now

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,500
whose application environment is more

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,300
complex than it was two years ago all

00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,270
right I should have gone the other way

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,139
right whose isn't because that's

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:01,820
overwhelmingly a majority in the room

00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:03,800
and you're not imagining it you're not

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:09,530
dreaming it as we look at the

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:11,870
application environments and we debug

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,900
the okay I have it I can't go too far

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:16,669
away from the little transmitter there

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,350
if the environment got got harder on us

00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,600
right we used to run years ago we'd run

00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,610
an application on a machine and then we

00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,600
introduced virtual machines and we sort

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:24,770
of had more complexity in the

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
environment and then we moved to the

00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,639
cloud and then we're a multi cloud and

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,050
then we started going to micro services

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,550
and that environment around us we

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,010
introduced Internet of Things we've got

00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:35,389
mobile devices it's all of those things

00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:37,520
got more complex and by the way in the

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,740
same way languages got more complex as

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,300
well that we introduced new languages so

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,940
you're not dreaming the application

00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,310
environment is at a point where humans

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:48,350
can no longer comprehend it it's just

00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,940
beyond our ability to understand the

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,360
thousands and thousands of metrics are

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,580
coming out of an environment like this

00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,700
and our traditional methods of managing

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,240
these environments is also leaving us

00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:01,460
behind

00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,870
so the separate control planes that

00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,460
we've used in the past of you know the

00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:06,830
security team looks after this and the

00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,539
networking team looks after that but as

00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:10,430
a quick example they both need to be

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,500
looking at you know fire war logs and

00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,979
things of that nature because is all of

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:18,860
that traffic coming in a successful

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:21,979
marketing campaign at last or is it a

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,630
denial of service attack so this

00:08:21,979 --> 00:08:25,070
existing sort of combination of going

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,080
will split everything up and what spoke

00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:30,260
focus and be an expert in a silo isn't

00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,850
going to work anymore so what can we do

00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,560
how can we augment ourselves the good

00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,969
news is we've come up with a technology

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,209
for that which is machine learning and

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,789
as I talk about machine learning it's

00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,020
important to get the level set right

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:45,500
we've all seen the movies you know

00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:47,620
whether it's iRobot or Terminator or ex

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,839
machina depending on your generation

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,760
where the robot is perfect you know and

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:54,560
they speak well and they interact with

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,030
humans and they have social skills and

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,370
you can't tell the difference between

00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,630
that and a human being in the trade we

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,290
call that artificial general

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:04,990
intelligence

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:06,670
it doesn't exist today and I would posit

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,990
and I'm happy to argue this over cup a

00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:14,079
cup of tea later on it will never exist

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:17,829
what we have today at least is that we

00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:21,519
train robots to do things this robot was

00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:24,129
taught to turn to identify a handle turn

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,470
the handle open the door all right

00:09:24,129 --> 00:09:30,100
it wasn't taught what to do with the

00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:32,740
door was already open and this proves

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:34,779
two things right one it's always funny

00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,550
when robots fall over I think it's the

00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,709
human experience right it's just the

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,899
nature of us and then the second one is

00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:42,699
that in machine learning in artificial

00:09:40,899 --> 00:09:44,649
intelligence if you don't teach

00:09:42,699 --> 00:09:46,509
something if you don't give something

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,600
that data it needs to learn something

00:09:46,509 --> 00:09:51,160
then it won't learn it and even worse it

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,040
won't tell you that you haven't taught

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,300
it a human can stick up their hand and

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,639
say I don't know how to do this you

00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,899
haven't taught me yet

00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,579
machine won't the machine learning won't

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,839
so this is this reality check and

00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:03,670
machine learning so let's look at a

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,230
quick training model for those in the

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:06,639
room who are machine learning experts

00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,740
and have run these sorts of things I

00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,110
apologize this is an oversimplification

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,370
you can hate me later for everybody else

00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,379
I'm just trying to establish where

00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,769
machine learning actually does what it

00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:19,209
actually does so I'm gonna try it well

00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,319
I'm not gonna run it today because I'm

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:21,550
not going to take on the demonstration

00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,499
gods I'm just going to show you some

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:25,089
quick snapshots training a model to

00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:27,370
predict the selling price of a home in

00:10:25,089 --> 00:10:29,230
San Francisco I have a data spreadsheet

00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:33,339
that is full of selling previous selling

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,019
prices of homes in San Francisco I tried

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:37,439
to find a data set for Philadelphia but

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,519
I couldn't find one so sorry about that

00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:42,399
so the home simple linear regression

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,889
what you get in Excel y equals a plus BX

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,540
ok so we start off with some basic

00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:48,610
terminology machine learning this is the

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:50,199
phrases I use in brackets or phrases

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,819
that other people use for the same thing

00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:53,679
so you think of you know there are

00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:55,300
columns of data I call them features and

00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,730
the thing we're trying to get to is the

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:01,329
objective or target and then each row of

00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,610
information is an instance ok so let me

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,529
go through this this is in Jupiter

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:06,939
so obviously I'm working in Python I'm

00:11:05,529 --> 00:11:09,250
bringing in pandas here to do the

00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:10,839
calculation because pandas is fine for

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,429
doing simple linear regression type

00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,990
calculations it's good for that and it

00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,270
means I don't have to move to a later or

00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:16,910
something

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,650
like that so important pandas in here

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,900
and then I read in my file I read in

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,480
this you know CSV file of all of the

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:29,600
previous sales and what I get from that

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:31,580
um ok and then I get to is it loads into

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,610
what pandas calls a data frame which is

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,830
kind of like a spreadsheet then I want

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:40,340
to drop unwanted features because

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:43,460
training models takes time and processor

00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:45,950
type consumption so the best way to

00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,170
minimize that is to not fill it with

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,640
data that you know won't help so you

00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:51,470
have duplicate data you've got the same

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,390
information in two places lose one of

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,550
them so I'm dropping unwanted features

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:58,280
here and I don't know it was this sort

00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,750
of legible down the back hopefully ok

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:02,170
I've got an email address at the end you

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,660
can get a copy of the presentation later

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:08,600
we see and then I'm analyzing I'm now

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:12,110
looking for my x-value what in all of

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:15,650
those bro sorry columns of data most

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:17,510
closely correlates to the selling price

00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:19,730
which is what I want is my outcome and

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:21,740
as you run through here you'll see that

00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,720
last sale price is one because guess

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,910
what that correlates to itself a hundred

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,260
percent of the time no surprise the

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,540
thing that surprised me though was that

00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,830
it wasn't sort of number of bathrooms or

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,690
like you know everybody says in real

00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,760
estate its location location allocation

00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,440
it wasn't the GPS coordinates that made

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,540
the the correlator best it was the

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,190
finished square footage that actually

00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:43,280
correlated best in this particular data

00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:45,080
set so now I've got my X I still only

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,090
the a and B in my linear regression day

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:52,990
you know algorithm so I grab the top

00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:55,640
correlative values for simplicity and

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,460
then I take I begin to train the model

00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,990
to calculate the a and B so what i'm

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,060
doing here is i'm taking my input desk

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,090
and hopefully you can see up there it

00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,480
says tess underscore skies size equals

00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:11,180
0.3 so I'm taking my entire data set and

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,830
splitting it into 70% 30% 30% I'm

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:15,320
holding aside for testing later on

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:17,150
because if I trained it on that 30% and

00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,130
then used it for testing the algorithms

00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:21,530
have already seen it it's redundant so I

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:23,120
split off 70% I train the model and then

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,310
I run that additional 30 percent of data

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,649
throw it to test it good so far that

00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,029
gives me some coefficients

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:30,619
sorry I forgot to point them out but

00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:32,660
this gives me some coefficients and

00:13:30,619 --> 00:13:35,300
intercepts there so now I sort of have

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,769
my a and B values and then just to see

00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,629
how it looks I wouldn't normally do this

00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:40,759
in the environment for the mistake of

00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:44,240
this conversation I ran a quick plot

00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:46,129
using map pot Lib to show the data and

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,069
the interesting thing is that I tend to

00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:50,509
be personally swayed by outliers if you

00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:52,160
had have asked me to hand draw a line

00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,170
here I probably would have drawn a

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,480
45-degree line because I see those

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:57,889
couple of outliers up the top there but

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,110
the machine learning is smarter than me

00:13:57,889 --> 00:14:01,490
and faster than me and it's drawn the

00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,839
line more appropriately based on the

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,240
cluster of data in the bottom left

00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:06,829
corner so you outcome here is to

00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,189
understand that a couple of things about

00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:14,990
machine learning it's not magic it's not

00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:17,209
you know the movies it's just fast it is

00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:18,679
faster and more able to identify

00:14:17,209 --> 00:14:20,230
clusters of information than we

00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:23,779
certainly are

00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:26,240
by the way can someone keep give me like

00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,639
a 5 when I'm 5 minutes left so that

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,459
because otherwise I will talk until this

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,670
evening I trust me

00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:36,290
so a IML is not magic it's just fast

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,879
right so hopefully that gives you a

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:39,920
little grip a little baseline on machine

00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:42,110
learning that what you need is lots of

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,459
metrics lots of data lots of different

00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:48,529
data so it gets smarter and smarter and

00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:50,149
the main thing is it's just much faster

00:14:48,529 --> 00:14:52,040
than you are as good as you are it's

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:55,610
much faster at you are at identifying

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:56,870
patterns in masses of data and if you

00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:58,579
haven't worked it out so far in the

00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,929
presentation you know I grew up on the

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:01,879
other side of the plot of the world and

00:14:59,929 --> 00:15:04,550
I've lived here for about 20 years now

00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:05,899
and I don't know whether data or data is

00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:10,249
the right way of saying things anymore

00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:12,259
so I use both I apologize so okay but

00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:14,149
what is AI ops well here's a sort of a

00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:16,339
ditch depth definition for you to play

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:19,459
with but essentially AI ops is an

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:22,040
augmentation to what we do and it does

00:15:19,459 --> 00:15:23,209
it powerfully in several key areas and I

00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:32,839
want to talk about each of those key

00:15:23,209 --> 00:15:36,799
areas all right oh hello

00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:39,529
distinct lag in here ok ok

00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,329
so again hands up question who has set

00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:43,009
up a performance monitoring tools

00:15:41,329 --> 00:15:46,160
we're in their career and had to set

00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:50,869
manually set thresholds right okay was

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:53,149
that fun no anybody fun know one of the

00:15:50,869 --> 00:15:55,549
biggest pains in the butt about setting

00:15:53,149 --> 00:15:57,860
manual thresholds is the aspect of what

00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:59,420
is normal you know it's always the first

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,129
question you roll your application out

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,569
and the people operations turn around

00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:04,790
and go well where should I set the

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:07,850
thresholds and like we have never run

00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,470
this code before I don't know the good

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,999
thing is that you can that's exactly

00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,189
what you can apply machine learning to

00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:15,350
let it run into your environment and let

00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:18,110
it automatically set thresholds for you

00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:19,730
and we do this in two ways there's two

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,670
key ways that this needs to happen right

00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:24,529
one is historical so that you know if

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:27,170
you get a massive logins at nine o'clock

00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:30,019
in the morning on a weekday that's not a

00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,429
bad thing I mean well I don't know it

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:32,989
might be you you can maybe you get in at

00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:34,339
ten o'clock or whenever people arrive at

00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:35,959
your office so you get a massive logins

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:37,699
first thing in the morning that's fine

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,829
you get a massive logins at three

00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,329
o'clock on a Thursday afternoon you've

00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,519
had an outage or you've got a denial of

00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:45,110
service attack so one of the things is

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,179
understanding the workload historically

00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:48,679
over time and again the machine learning

00:16:47,179 --> 00:16:50,119
is very good at doing that sort of

00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,910
clustering and working out what's going

00:16:50,119 --> 00:16:55,489
on the second one the one that I love is

00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:58,249
contextual of the thousands of metrics

00:16:55,489 --> 00:17:00,499
that it is analyzing it works out the

00:16:58,249 --> 00:17:02,419
cognitive engine works out which metrics

00:17:00,499 --> 00:17:04,639
are moving together with each other and

00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:06,949
which ones are moving in a position to

00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:09,139
each other and looks for those patterns

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:10,610
in the real world so it automatically

00:17:09,139 --> 00:17:13,699
sets the baselines on this information

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,019
and then it is looking to that

00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:19,370
information running in the live

00:17:15,019 --> 00:17:21,289
environment so as a quick examples two

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:22,760
metrics transactions per second you get

00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:24,589
more transactions your network bandwidth

00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,809
usage goes up makes sense you sort of

00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:29,210
look at it think you're fair enough so

00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:31,070
if they go up and down together that's

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,860
fine all right

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,080
but if transactions per second goes up

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,580
and that way bandwidth goes flat you've

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,990
got a constraint in your environment

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:41,840
something you've got an outage or a

00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:44,059
slowdown about to happen and this is

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,340
where on the on the observational side

00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:48,799
on the real-time side cognitive 'angels

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,659
camp in machine learning can give you

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,020
the information before the outage before

00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:54,950
the phone call before the ticket so

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,410
contextually

00:17:54,950 --> 00:18:02,150
relating metrics is a big ones the next

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,830
one is automated triage which is if you

00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,810
think you've got a cluster of instances

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,100
running in environment and your normal

00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,690
monitor will sort of go here's all your

00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:10,390
instances and maybe it'll even show you

00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,600
hey these instances are under stress

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,270
right

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,740
but then what are you going to do step

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,150
into each instance to try and work out

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,640
because there's lots of ones that aren't

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,600
under stress so what's going on here

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,950
machine learning is very good at

00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,300
discerning patterns very good at

00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,570
identifying clustering there are

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,700
specific algorithms for clustering data

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:30,200
so what machine learning gives you is

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,090
interpreting that information and

00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,220
looking at what it will simply examine

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,810
the things that you would do what's

00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,150
common between these what's different

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,640
between these but much faster than you

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,260
can do it now we won't necessarily show

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,670
you a chart like that of just you know

00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:45,740
of clustering the data because that's

00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,110
not giving you insight it's just giving

00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,370
you visibility of the information

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:51,080
instead we'd show something somebody

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:53,630
needs to show and automate a root cause

00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:55,460
type analysis and if you look at this in

00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:58,190
across the top the line across the top

00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:59,780
here it's showing you the you know

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:02,510
what's the first question with any

00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,970
anomaly when did this begin when did

00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:06,740
this start happening so we put a time

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:07,730
line up the top there to say this is

00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,020
when it started and you see it

00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,270
eventually goes green it gets addressed

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,860
in the middle we're showing you the can

00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:14,480
visualize in this is about sort of

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,370
visual the observability of the

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,980
environment this is we're showing you

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:19,790
the components they're impacting that

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,560
but the key thing here is that

00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:23,150
clustering theme we present in this way

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,730
that will then show you the tops of

00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:28,420
expected causes that are causing these

00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:34,820
metrics to be' to behave in this way

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:38,870
it's time for a quick set I always get

00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,370
dry mouth when I speak so automated root

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,810
causes so we have baselining so you

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,420
don't have to manually set thresholds

00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:47,210
we've got cluster analysis to help

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,280
identify and triage problems we've got

00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:51,700
root cause analysis to take you to the

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,290
location where the anomaly is happening

00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:56,030
now sometimes finding the source of

00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,920
something is easy sometimes it's not

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:01,190
particularly in slowdowns performance

00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,660
issues we will guide you in that way but

00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,650
there's another aspect of this so we're

00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,240
sort of been taught so far I've been

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,800
talking about going from the application

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,840
down into the infrastructure whether

00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,210
it's cloud or mobile or whatever

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,409
but going from the application down the

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,960
other aspect of this is going from the

00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:16,399
application up because while you have a

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,749
piece of code you know I had a piece of

00:20:16,399 --> 00:20:19,940
code that did an interest calculation

00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:22,249
well you have a piece of code that does

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,899
one thing the customer's experience or

00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:25,279
the users experience is normally a

00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:27,320
connection of multiple things in

00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,940
multiple locations and you need to

00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,889
understand that experience and how your

00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,480
code works with that and that's going

00:20:30,889 --> 00:20:36,110
from the application up into the

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,029
business transaction so you need to load

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,009
that data in this is a strategic point

00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:41,720
you need to load that information into

00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:46,369
your cognitive engine as well so it can

00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,379
learn those lessons what that does for

00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:50,299
you and I'm jumping through this in the

00:20:48,379 --> 00:20:51,740
interest of time but if you consider an

00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:53,779
environment where everything in the

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,399
technology is ok it's just below the

00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:57,409
threshold so it hasn't gone yellow yet

00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,509
it's just below but every single piece

00:20:57,409 --> 00:21:00,919
in the way you know that your actual

00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:03,019
customer experience is going to suck

00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,029
because they're now getting seconds of

00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:07,279
delay from each piece along the way and

00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:08,659
you can see that if you can see the

00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,649
business transaction you see people

00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:15,679
abandoning your environment so having

00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:18,769
talked about very briefly about you know

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,139
what AI Ops is generally around now in

00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:22,309
conversations people are ok but I don't

00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,840
want to have to go and deal with that

00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:25,340
myself all the time because that will

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,399
kill me too even though you've saved

00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,690
time on diagnosis and records and if

00:21:28,399 --> 00:21:31,159
you're an SRE and you'll have a problem

00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:32,600
with the phrase root cause again I'm

00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:35,929
happy to have that argument with you

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,799
later over a cup of tea somewhere but at

00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:39,080
this stage you're thinking about

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,700
automation and from all the work I've

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:43,909
done with clients I've come up with five

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:44,840
criteria to allow you to prioritize what

00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,999
you're going to automate in your

00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:49,519
environments so the first one is

00:21:46,999 --> 00:21:50,990
frequency and essentially you use these

00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:52,220
you create a spreadsheet you build a

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,480
list of everything you think you might

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,460
want to automate and then you give it

00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,860
values and then you sort it by the

00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,450
highest value so let's start with

00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:03,559
frequency frequency is how often does

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:05,149
this happen if it happens a lot okay you

00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:06,559
give it a higher score if it's the first

00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:09,049
time it's ever happened there's a

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,279
secondary question because it might be

00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:12,940
the first time it ever happened because

00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:15,379
it almost happened 12 times in the past

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,750
so you also want to have a sort of query

00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:18,950
language around your information and

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,960
your machine learning so that you can go

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,210
back and search oh yeah this just broke

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,490
the model but

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,470
you know did that happen never in the

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,610
last two years or almost a hundred times

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,100
in the last two years and that's

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,990
frequency both did it almost happen and

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,419
did it actually happen and that assesses

00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,860
a score the second is impact and this

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:37,629
comes from their business transaction

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,190
information I was talking about so you

00:22:37,629 --> 00:22:40,869
can see whether this outage has an

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,700
impact it had just annoy the operator

00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:44,340
and nobody else in the world even

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,600
realized it was happening

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,149
sorry operator it's not that important

00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,070
but was that annoying the customer and

00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:52,840
it wasn't an issue for the operations in

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,369
development environment very different

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,230
situations so you need to understand the

00:22:54,369 --> 00:22:58,649
business impact of what you're going to

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:02,529
try to remediate through automation

00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:05,350
third one here is coverage how much of

00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:07,509
the remediation can you automate if

00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:09,309
there's a step in the process somewhere

00:23:07,509 --> 00:23:10,330
on the way through where you need to

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:11,799
pull out you know if someone has to

00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,600
physically go and pull something out and

00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:15,009
plug it back in again or someone has to

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,649
phone up their cloud service provider

00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:19,389
and ask them to change a setting then

00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:21,159
automating everything around that won't

00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,899
necessarily help you that much unless

00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:24,759
they're very complex steps I'll come

00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:27,220
back to complex and mundane in a second

00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:31,570
so coverage can you automate the

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:33,909
remediation entirely next one is

00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:37,330
probability the probability of success

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:39,970
of your remediation so you've written

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,679
the world's best self shell script you

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,960
know and it's but the thing of beauty

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,559
like my interest code and you're very

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,940
proud of it but it only works about

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,529
three out of five times and the other

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,929
two times it's sort of you're not quite

00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:54,129
sure but it doesn't quite work the

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:56,980
probability of success is another score

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:59,230
of what you should automate and then the

00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,809
final one is time scale how long does

00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:03,249
the remediation take so in that example

00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:05,499
of the network bandwidth that I gave

00:24:03,249 --> 00:24:06,700
earlier all right you just want to give

00:24:05,499 --> 00:24:08,259
it more debt we're back you know if that

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,700
happens at 3 a.m. you don't want a phone

00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:11,320
call just give it more network bandwidth

00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,129
and you can fix it at 9 a.m. to work out

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,100
what's going wrong

00:24:12,129 --> 00:24:16,749
that's an idiot automation but maybe

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:20,139
remediation needed a rebuild of the

00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:22,960
database maybe a remediation needed a

00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:24,580
recovery of a server maybe remediation

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,190
meant a failover to a disaster recovery

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:29,619
site well you may not want to fully

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,330
automate those they're complex

00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:33,789
CMA want to automate them but you might

00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,610
want an operator step in there to go do

00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:37,500
you really want to do this and then

00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:38,760
say yes and then you move on because

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:40,980
it's going to impact the rest of your

00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:43,500
environment so those are five criteria

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:45,690
for you to use when assessing what you

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,400
should automate and the reason I give

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,160
you a criteria is because automation

00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:52,049
incurs technical debt when you build an

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,570
automation automated remediation today

00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:56,340
and then you update an operating system

00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,929
or change an application or use a new

00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:02,280
language you may have to change that

00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:04,740
then so the good news is you only have

00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:06,390
five minutes of when you're left and

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,850
that's good because we're almost at the

00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,190
end here so how is AI ops in a you know

00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,770
talked about the benefits of AI ops the

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:16,080
absence of threshold setting the root

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:17,940
cause analysis that is done for you the

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,919
narrowing down from you know it could be

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,040
anything to this team needs to work on

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,500
it so there is an immediate relief to

00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:26,419
the engineering burden from AI ops which

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,780
is why I thoroughly recommend

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:31,650
investigating it today you must

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,780
strategically you must consider a

00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:35,130
cross-domain strategy you can't just do

00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:36,480
it for the application it's got to be

00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:38,669
done for the infrastructure it's got to

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,559
be done with third-party providers so as

00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:42,120
I say from the application down through

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:44,400
the infrastructure from the application

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:46,169
up to the business transaction you know

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,270
out on the front end to mobile devices

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,890
Internet of thing devices and so on and

00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:52,140
out the back end through your servers

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:54,840
and cloud providers and micro services

00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,360
and the goal is to automate the complex

00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,600
of mundane complex because that's how

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,010
human error gets into systems because

00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:04,350
people make a mistake under the pressure

00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:05,760
at the moment mundane because you know

00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,110
what it's like you know you've got this

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,880
thing and every three days you have to

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,200
sit and type the same damn commands to

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,120
make this this to fix it and get it

00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,370
working again and you don't need that in

00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,860
your life so complex and mundane are the

00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:18,150
things you want to be looking for laughs

00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:20,370
another key factor here is that you want

00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:22,650
to build your human skills I wrote a

00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:24,510
piece on Forbes published a piece that I

00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,780
wrote on on this topic sort of thing

00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:31,230
I've got a link later on on it that we

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:33,720
need to be experts in an area and you

00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:37,169
are all experts in some particular silo

00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,360
or in individual area but in today's

00:26:37,169 --> 00:26:41,669
world the complexity of where we live

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,580
the complexity of our application

00:26:41,669 --> 00:26:47,160
environments and how how we ship code

00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:48,480
and then how that code runs is so

00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,200
significant we need some understanding

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,090
of the rest

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,000
that areas as we go to software-defined

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,039
infrastructure you know infrastructure

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,929
is becoming software so operations teams

00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,630
need to be understanding and learning

00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:02,100
the software development lifecycle

00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:04,679
because that's how they're rolling out

00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:06,600
things now similarly you're putting

00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:07,950
definitions as you build products and

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,260
test them you're putting definitions

00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:11,789
with it you know you're using spinnaker

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,289
or kubernetes a chef or puppet you're

00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:15,419
limiting the infrastructure capabilities

00:27:13,289 --> 00:27:18,600
the environment well what you push

00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:19,860
through and ship has to be something

00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,110
that can live in the proper

00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:23,789
infrastructure so you need to become

00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,529
aware as an individual instead of just

00:27:23,789 --> 00:27:27,480
being sort of a nice shape I'm a coder

00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:30,389
in this language of that language we

00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:31,950
need to become t-shaped skillsets where

00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:34,110
we have an understanding of what the

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,340
database stars and how the DBA does

00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,809
things with the database what the

00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,909
network is doing and how its configured

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,919
and how network administrator's see

00:27:38,909 --> 00:27:42,210
their network environment and straight

00:27:40,919 --> 00:27:44,519
across all of the technologies in

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,320
infrastructure and the last one here is

00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,880
that you know as I said at the top of

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,799
the presentation if you think you know

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,440
if your life is complex it is you're not

00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:54,630
alone you're all in here in the room for

00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,159
a good reason and we need to augment

00:27:54,630 --> 00:28:00,870
ourselves and there is technology out

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:03,149
there can do that so to bring this home

00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,769
is a couple of links there kind of thing

00:28:03,149 --> 00:28:08,159
there's a lot more writing that I've

00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:10,409
done you can go to tech whisper my

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,070
c-calm to see some of the posts I've

00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:13,139
done there

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,240
I work for app dynamics kind of thing we

00:28:13,139 --> 00:28:17,010
have a booth upstairs we have giveaways

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,200
and bouncy balls and things like that so

00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:20,370
come and see us please

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,230
come and give me feedback on the

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,960
presentation was this a valuable use of

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:27,840
30 minutes of your life and I think

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,760
we're going to a break next no we've got

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,289
other things first okay I got an

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:33,539
announcement first it's my job

00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:36,029
sorry what are we doing okay I'll take

00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:37,260
over don't worry about it yep okay thank

00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,700
you for your time

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,880
[Applause]

00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,880
[Music]

00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,400
you
