[Music]

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,910
hi I'm Marisa I work for fearless a

00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,009
digital services firm based out of

00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:22,779
Baltimore I'm a DevOps engineer and I'm

00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,250
currently working on automation for a

00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:26,500
project for the Center for Medicare and

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:28,180
Medicaid Services I'm here to talk about

00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,460
non-technical skills for technical

00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:32,590
people so what do I mean by

00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,899
non-technical skills these are gonna be

00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:36,610
any of your soft skills plus any skills

00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:38,829
that are not directly required in your

00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:40,360
career field but these are important

00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,100
skills because they affect the way that

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,540
you complete your day-to-day tasks so

00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,860
there's something you want to bring to

00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,370
the front of your mind and work on in

00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,329
the future researching so research it

00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,650
could be anything from going to a

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:51,730
conference it let's need to talk to

00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:53,680
having a conversation with a co-worker

00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,840
or go into the library and reading a

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,280
book but let's be honest is the 21st

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,899
century and the quickest and easiest way

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,720
to find any information is to get online

00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:03,250
and google it so if somebody asks you a

00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,079
question you don't know the answer your

00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,520
response should be I don't know but I

00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:08,020
can find out because nobody knows

00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,670
everything but somebody knows something

00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,840
about what you're trying to do and you

00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,430
just need a hone in on your sleuthing

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,799
skills in order to find that information

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:16,510
so the first way that I would always do

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,330
this is to just copy and paste your

00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,620
error into Google in this case I was

00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,390
making some terraform changes but I

00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,740
hadn't touched this exact resource so I

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:25,450
wasn't expecting to see a change

00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,979
I literally just copied and pasted that

00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:29,470
change into Google and the very first

00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:30,760
link had my solution that's not always

00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,900
gonna be the case though sometimes you

00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,130
don't have something to copy and paste

00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,409
or sometimes you don't get your answer

00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:37,180
in this case I was upgrading terraform

00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:39,580
11 to terraform 12 and not actually

00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:40,869
changing any resources at all so I was

00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,460
surprised to see all these different

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:43,720
changes and there's no way I can just

00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:45,549
copy and paste that whole thing into

00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,380
Google that's not gonna give me anything

00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:49,510
so you need to be a little more vague

00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,740
and use key words so in this situation I

00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,689
see the mounts are changing so I'd

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,930
Google something like terraform mount

00:01:52,689 --> 00:01:57,939
reorder upgrade or terraform subnet

00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,020
change upgrade and that'll get you a

00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,619
bunch of different links that you will

00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,330
eventually be able to find your solution

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,100
obviously we all know how to read but

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,170
there's a difference between reading a

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,420
fictional novel and reading any kind of

00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,739
technical literature if you're reading a

00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,090
technical book you want to make sure

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:14,530
you're taking notes and bookmarking

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,150
things that you want to come back to or

00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,230
you know you'll use in the future but

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:19,390
more often than not we find ourselves

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:21,280
looking at documentation if you're

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,300
reading documentation make sure you read

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,410
it thoroughly so I'm just trying to

00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,490
teach you how to do something there's

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,930
not a bunch of extra fluff

00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,250
in there you shouldn't just be blindly

00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,500
copy and pasting commands without

00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,380
reading the comments because who knows

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,970
what you're gonna end up doing so those

00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:36,490
first two skills were all about learning

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,930
you do not want to have to do reread all

00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:40,780
those things and re research everything

00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:42,190
so document document document make sure

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,750
you're taking notes that make sense to

00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,760
you so you can reproduce what you did

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,380
the first time and I would suggest you

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,330
publish these even if only internally

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,680
for your co-workers to use so if you're

00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,240
making a document that other people need

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,830
to look at make sure it's clear and

00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,450
concise with comments and reasons why

00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,160
you did things as well as copy and paste

00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,110
able commands with optional arguments

00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,550
don't just dump everything from your

00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,780
terminal because nobody's gonna know

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:04,510
what that means nobody's gonna be able

00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,470
to reproduce that in their situation as

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,670
we all know there's people from

00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:08,320
different walks of the earth in the

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:09,010
technical field and not only that but

00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,750
you're going to be dealing with

00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,880
non-technical people daily whether it be

00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,140
a customer or an office admin you need

00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,280
to know your audience and be able to

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:16,110
communicate with all of these different

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,090
kinds of people

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,370
so in general treat everybody with

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,780
kindness and respect if you're having a

00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,680
conversation with somebody you want to

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,380
make sure you get your point across

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,940
across but don't speak over them in

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,110
order to get that done make sure

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:32,110
everybody feels comfortable in the

00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:33,580
situation you're in daily communication

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,590
is something that is especially

00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,510
important if you are coworkers remote

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,040
you might decide that you don't need a

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,390
stand-up every single day but something

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,890
as easy as saying good morning in your

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,480
slack channel that will get the

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,890
conversation rolling and you get daily

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,850
communication between your team members

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,310
which makes everybody work better

00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,900
together

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,340
socializing you know some people don't

00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,900
necessarily feel comfortable introducing

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,400
themselves so go up to the new person

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,050
and invite them out to lunch or if

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,220
you're in a group conversation and you

00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,410
notice somebody's kind of falling behind

00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,470
ask them their opinion and clear the

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,090
floor so that they'll speak up there's

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,340
oftentimes a stigma about asking

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,720
questions in a public channel is it a

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,310
dumb question does everybody else

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,540
already know the answer so you want to

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,830
strive to make your public channels a

00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:15,570
safe place where people feel comfortable

00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:15,570
to ask questions without being ridiculed

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,709
if you're explaining something to

00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,670
somebody and it's a technical thing you

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:23,560
have to be careful to give enough detail

00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,570
so that they understand what you're

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,240
saying but not be condescending so I

00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,650
like to preface my things with I'm gonna

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,790
start from the beginning but please let

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:32,729
me know if I'm going too deep into

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,930
something that you already know about

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:36,190
disagreements are inevitable if you're

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,840
having a disagreement with somebody and

00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,250
try to take a step back and see their

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,900
if you're having a slack conversation

00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,970
try switching to a video call because

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:44,260
sometimes intent is lost in text and

00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:45,970
you're really not getting anywhere

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,520
invite a third party to be kind of a

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,900
mediator in the situation so these are

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,640
just some of the skills that I find most

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,560
important on my day to day job as a

00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,020
DevOps engineer and my hope was that it

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,250
brought the attention to you guys to

00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,750
think about what skills you either have

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,050
or you don't have that you can work on

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:04,570
to help Excel you in your career and I

00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:06,640
realized I only had 19 slides so my 20th

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,990
slide is just my contact information so

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,190
feel free to reach out to me if you want

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,720
to talk about this or just find me at

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,630
the conference I'd love to know your

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:27,930
thoughts thanks guys Thank You Marissa
