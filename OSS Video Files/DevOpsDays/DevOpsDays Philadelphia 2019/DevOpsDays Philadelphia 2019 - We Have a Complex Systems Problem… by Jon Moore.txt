	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - We Have a Complex Systems Problem…and We Need to Talk About It by Jon Moore

Software used to be something that you walked into a Babbage’s store in the mall and bought in a box. That’s clearly no longer the case. The tech industry’s products and services have grown massively in scale and complexity since that time, and we’re now at a point where no one person can truly understand the systems we’re building entirely. Let’s actually take a look at what we can learn from the academic field of complexity theory: what are the essential characteristics of “complex systems”, and what changes do they imply we need to make in our approach to building and delivering the software systems of today?

00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:21,380
so uh so this is what happens when you

00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:23,450
don't have blameless post-mortems but I

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,460
apologize it won't be a sort of mobile

00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:29,599
around the stage very much here but

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:33,680
happy to be here this morning so we have

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:40,010
a complex systems problem and we need to

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:42,200
talk so how many folks have heard of or

00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:45,109
are familiar with this framework maybe

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,960
you have seen this before I am NOT a

00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:51,109
native speaker of Welsh I believe that

00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,210
this is pronounced King Evan if you do

00:00:51,109 --> 00:00:55,429
speak Welsh please find me afterwards

00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,050
and tell me how how a non-native speaker

00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:00,559
Walsh can at least get closer to saying

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:03,260
it right but what this frame were talks

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,870
about is this is a way of thinking about

00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:10,250
how difficult the problem that you're

00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:11,930
currently trying to solve is and so so

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,330
so there's a variety of things and the

00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,250
idea is that if you can understand which

00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,140
prop or which one of these quadrants

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,490
your problem fits in to you there are

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,550
then different approaches for solving

00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,920
that problem so the first type of

00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,000
problem is one that is simple these are

00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,640
things where there is an obvious

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,420
solution so if I were to take this

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,090
remote and let go of it and say what

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,590
direction is it going to move that it's

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,360
it's going to fall to the ground right

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:41,090
that's pretty obvious it's got a simple

00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,430
solution and so so if you have something

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,190
you just do the obvious thing right

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:47,990
these are generally not the types of

00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:52,130
things that most of us deal with on a

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:54,110
day to day and our jobs complicated

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:56,510
problems are ones where the solution

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:59,150
isn't obvious but there is sort of a

00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:00,740
solution you can arrive at and so an

00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:03,950
equivalent example would be okay if I

00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,810
let go of this remote at a certain

00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:09,080
height how long will it take to hit the

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,300
ground we might have to go dig up our

00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,459
highschool physics textbooks to do that

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:15,769
but there's a right answer meaning that

00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:17,150
that I can actually analyze this thing

00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:18,680
and come up with a solution that will be

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,900
predictive of what's going to happen

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,269
okay so these are these are complicated

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:26,840
problems

00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:30,349
the next next level are complex problems

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,079
and so these are ones where our or

00:02:30,349 --> 00:02:35,439
systems where we can't necessarily have

00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:37,400
predictive knowledge of cause and effect

00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:39,739
we can understand what happened

00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,579
afterwards so so if this was a tennis

00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:45,560
ball instead and and I were to say hey

00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,569
I'm gonna throw this tennis ball out

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,849
over in that direction where will it

00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,889
land this could be a complex problem

00:02:49,849 --> 00:02:54,829
because somebody could stand up and

00:02:51,889 --> 00:02:56,569
catch it it may bounce off of a number

00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:58,310
of different things in in sort of

00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:00,859
unpredictable ways but but if we were

00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,430
able to have say a video recording of

00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:06,049
that going on afterwards we could I say

00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:08,030
uh okay well he threw it over there and

00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:09,560
it bounced off the wall and then bounced

00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,819
off that person's head and then rolled

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,439
under the chair over here and we

00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:14,930
actually be able to understand how it

00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,370
got where it got right but it's hard to

00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:21,469
predict ahead of time what's gonna

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:22,879
happen the the next level is our chaotic

00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:24,950
systems we're like you can't even

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,479
understand cause and effect in these

00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:29,269
sorts of systems and these are these are

00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,650
very difficult systems to go and deal

00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:34,280
with um and so this would be something

00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:37,459
like hey I'm gonna throw the tennis ball

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,810
out there and while we may have video

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,979
recording of that going on we're gonna

00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,689
turn out the lights

00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:43,609
while that's going on and we're going to

00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,409
turn them off when it's done we can see

00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:47,389
where it ended up but we're not really

00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:49,579
sure how it got there or why right

00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:53,329
that's that's what living in a complex

00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:54,919
system is like so so in this talk when

00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:57,409
I'm hopefully gonna convince you of is

00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:59,989
that the the systems that we deal with

00:03:57,409 --> 00:04:02,419
on a regular basis here in the and the

00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:06,379
technology industry are in fact complex

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:08,900
systems and that as a result because of

00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:11,329
the sort of difficulty of these types of

00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:13,340
systems and problems we have to actually

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:16,340
adapt our approaches to deal with them

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,139
successfully okay now it turns out

00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,900
there's a whole branch of science called

00:04:18,139 --> 00:04:23,360
complexity theory that studies complex

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,030
systems and so what I want to do is I

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,860
want to run you through a few of the

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,560
sort of core characteristics that

00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,139
complex systems have and then see if

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,250
these seem familiar or you know to your

00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:37,350
regular experience so

00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,090
one of the one of the first properties

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,670
of complex systems is that they can

00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:43,860
exhibit cascading failures right this is

00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,380
the idea that one part of the system

00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,390
might fail and then that causes another

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,830
part of the system to fail and then that

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,990
causes another part of the system to

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,380
fail and so on right

00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:57,300
you know anybody have anyone have

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,640
experience with one of your services

00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,330
failing and then other services failing

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,470
as a result

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,360
I mean raise your hands if you've had

00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:06,210
that happen right that's a lot of people

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,660
okay this is this is pretty familiar I

00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:11,670
think that you know there are actually

00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,230
great resources one oh one is that one

00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:17,760
of my favorites is a book called release

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:19,230
it by Michael Nygaard and and in this

00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,970
book and you actually the second edition

00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,530
was recently released I've only all

00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,240
admit I've only read the first edition

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,910
but that was pretty awesome and I think

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,680
I highly recommend this book but they

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,770
they have a bunch of what he describes

00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,990
as stability patterns so these are just

00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:36,120
patterns you can apply to your systems

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:38,130
that will propel to prevent some of

00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,410
these cascading failures right the big

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:42,660
idea is to try to if there's a failure

00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,070
going on try to contain it and keep it

00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,290
in one area and so he's got a lot of

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:50,010
great patterns you can apply to your

00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:53,100
systems as a result of this complex

00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:56,100
systems are also often open systems

00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,320
which means that they don't operate in

00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,169
isolation if they operate in the context

00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,700
of an environment and and there are

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:06,000
interactions with the with the outside

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,830
environment so how many folks have how

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,190
many folks run services that that have

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:15,000
customers how many of your customers

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:16,680
work for your company I mean some people

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,770
are you know run internal products so

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,680
that's fine so so this is a good example

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,150
where hey there is you know there is all

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,370
kind of how many people have had a

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,880
production incident caused because your

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:32,100
customers did something unexpected right

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,540
so this is a really good example of the

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,240
types of things that go on right there's

00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:39,000
all this stuff that happens outside even

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,100
of the technical systems or even the the

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,960
techno social systems right I've heard I

00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:45,390
think John Wall Spa is maybe where I

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,669
first heard that that term but but you

00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:49,139
know are the systems that we that we are

00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:50,460
used to working with

00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,220
we're actually part of those systems

00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,949
right the the teams that actually cause

00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,050
changes to happen right like I wrote

00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:59,550
code I pushed it to production I just

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:03,900
changed the system I'm part of that

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:05,009
system right and so your processes and

00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,520
the things that you do on a regular

00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:10,530
basis are also part of the system you

00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,280
know other really good examples you know

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,620
we all sort run in the in the context of

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,240
of an industry right where you know

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:20,969
there's tons of open-source that's going

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,639
on right now you can't actually I think

00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:26,610
have an effective technology strategy

00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:28,860
and completely ignore open-source that

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,930
that's really rare right open-source is

00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,039
where a ton of innovation happens it's

00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:34,860
where a ton of collective development

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:36,810
happens and and it can be a real

00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,370
business risk to not pay attention to

00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,199
that stuff and to figure out how that

00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,550
fits in I'm you know it's not to say

00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:43,050
like you use open source for everything

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:44,430
but but if you're not at least

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:47,189
considering it you're probably missing

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,560
some things you know we have open

00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:52,680
standards right even the networks that

00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:56,370
we work on right PGP is a good example

00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,289
of you know there's no one central

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,690
authority that runs BGP right that's a

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,370
that's a collaboration among multiple

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,940
network operators to make the internet

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:07,589
work and so so those are those are other

00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,240
examples of interactions that we often

00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:14,060
have that that sort of extend outside

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:14,060
our direct systems and behavior so

00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:19,800
complex systems also have memory and and

00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,870
this is the idea that the complex system

00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,819
can remember things that happen to it in

00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:27,509
the past and that that affects the

00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:30,389
future behavior and I mean well our

00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:33,930
servers literally have memory as do we

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:36,240
we also have memories how many people

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,190
have you know how many people I've ever

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,209
told a production war story to somebody

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:44,159
else in your company right and so that

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:45,570
that's a good example of like hey I

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,310
remember this thing that happened I'm

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,140
actually passing that knowledge on to

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,850
one of my teammates that might affect

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:52,620
that teammates behavior right because

00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,449
hopefully we're good at learning from

00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,300
other people's mistakes before we have

00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:58,470
to make them you know ourselves but but

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,959
there are all kinds of behaviors here I

00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:02,700
mean any system that has a database is a

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,910
very straightforward example of this

00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,070
we're hey the the reaction to your

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,360
request might depend on updates that

00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:13,410
have happened to the database in the

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,720
past right so so for sure this is where

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,810
we are now something that's really

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,340
interesting is and I think especially

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,290
when we start to think about the fact

00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,330
that our systems are comprised both of

00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,070
the technical systems and the people

00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,900
that interoperate with them

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,870
I think there there are often

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:36,030
opportunities to to take more advantage

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:39,510
of memory than we do this is I'm

00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:41,490
actually found this so this is a this is

00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,740
a meeting or the minutes of the

00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:46,590
Proceedings of a general meeting of the

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,300
citizens of Philadelphia so all of the

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:51,570
citizens of Philadelphia apparently had

00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:55,050
one big meetup and and they wrote down

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,610
the minutes and so how many people write

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,180
down minutes of the meetings that they

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:04,620
attend right a handful of folks so good

00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:08,700
for you the you know so back in when was

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:11,610
this 1717 1792 so if this was a good

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,770
idea in 1792 when it was actually a lot

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,170
harder to write down and disseminate

00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:19,170
information how you know why aren't we

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,180
taking advantage of this now especially

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:24,390
when because you know lots of the things

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,530
that we do do impact others you know in

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:27,150
our department that couldn't be in that

00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,100
meeting sometimes it's actually just a

00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,050
direct colleague on my team who couldn't

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,330
be at the meeting right had a doctor's

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:34,320
appointment I couldn't be there there

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:35,610
are lots of good reasons here but

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,100
there's lots of other people that may

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,540
not even realize that that meeting was

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,240
happening or that a decision was made

00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,150
that they care about and so writing

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,360
things in and could be really useful

00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,600
anybody recognize this a handful of

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,730
folks so if you don't recognize this

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,220
this was the Google Search Appliance so

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:58,350
this is a product that that Google it's

00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:59,640
been discontinued but but the idea was

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,410
they would they would give you a they

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,120
would give you a server you would rack

00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,040
it up in your inner datacenter and would

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,280
go index all your stuff so you could

00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:12,960
have internal Google search of all of

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:15,000
your internal documents so so so how

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,070
many how many people how many people

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,380
have

00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:20,120
of multiple systems where they put

00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,170
information in on a regular basis you

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,320
know over the course you other day I

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,840
like you know we got slack maybe JIRA

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,420
maybe github

00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,040
you know source control comments

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,720
nevermind wikis things of that sort

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,270
right like there's there's all kinds of

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,310
information there going on how many

00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:42,140
people have a federated search across

00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:43,880
all of those things right so so there's

00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,500
there's tons of information that that

00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,450
we're not taking a manage of where we're

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,940
actually in some sense handicapping

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:51,250
ourselves as a complex system by not

00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,660
taking advantage of some of these things

00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,210
which which in some cases have technical

00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,930
solutions which is kind of interesting

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,870
so if you're interested in this

00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,010
federated search problem actually this

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:02,480
is something I've been like thinking

00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,710
about it sounds like a pretty good at

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,000
open source project so if you're

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,870
interested in that come and come and

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,360
find me afterwards complex systems often

00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,510
exhibit nesting behavior which means

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,460
that complex the components that make up

00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:20,660
a complex system are often complex

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:23,540
systems themselves and so in a technical

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:26,060
setting for example that means you know

00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,890
it is Turtles all the way down right it

00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,580
means that you know hey maybe I've got a

00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:33,110
region of my cloud provider that that's

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,670
a complex system the you know

00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:36,590
availability zoom within that region

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,570
that's a complex system a particular

00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:41,600
service right which may be composed of

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,160
multiple micro services or even you know

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,800
given micro service may also have

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,330
multiple processes or threads and and we

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,430
can go all the way down and understand

00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,950
that actually lots of things all the way

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:56,840
down to a pre low level exhibit a lot of

00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:58,490
these behaviors of complex systems so so

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,680
this is not just something where it's

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:02,720
like hey we can sort of paint the magic

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:04,910
deal with complex systems brush up at

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,290
the at the top level of thinking about

00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,900
these things this is actually something

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:11,050
that's that's pretty fundamental that

00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:14,120
that we need to start to think through

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,980
complex systems also have dynamic

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,600
networks of interactions where we're

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,220
connections are formed and broken and

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,310
sometimes some of those connections are

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,840
closed and some of them are are far

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,490
there's actually the way our brains are

00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,220
set up right so we have we have tons of

00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,440
neurons

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,089
neurons both are connected to other

00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,209
nearby neurons but but some of them also

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:37,050
have really long-distance connections as

00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:38,459
well to other parts of our brain and and

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,480
so you know what's really interesting

00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:45,899
and actually recently I think I think

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,279
we've seen some tools show up that I've

00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,910
actually given us a better opportunity

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,649
to do this in our organizations so how

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,279
many people are I've heard of Conway's

00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:57,689
law only a few folks okay so this is all

00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:59,699
right so all right all right when we got

00:13:57,689 --> 00:14:03,779
a this total sidebar on Conway's law for

00:13:59,699 --> 00:14:06,060
a second so so so Mel Conway who by the

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:08,899
way tweets still tweets but in I think

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,279
sometime in the 1960s published a paper

00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,649
which described the way human

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:17,550
Committee's design stuff and what he

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:20,240
said was that that a group of people is

00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:22,379
constrained to design a system that

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,509
matches the communication patterns of

00:14:22,379 --> 00:14:26,279
the people who designed it and so an

00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:28,589
easy way of understanding this is if I

00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,420
have three teams that are developing a

00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:33,360
compiler together I will have a

00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,040
three-stage compiler if I have three

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,959
teams that are building something I'll

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,870
have at least three micro services in my

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,759
architecture right Steven Sinofsky once

00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:45,750
summarized this as you ship your org

00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,430
chart and so and really in a lot of

00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:49,410
companies especially large companies we

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,380
still rely a lot on organizational

00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:54,269
structure to communicate things around

00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,240
the company but but we actually now have

00:14:54,269 --> 00:14:59,279
tools that that allow for this type of

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,439
much more dynamic forming of

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,269
relationships and communications right

00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:04,680
slack channels I can go join a slack

00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:07,079
channel I can leave a slack channel

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,639
right I can go find the slack Channel

00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:10,199
let's go participate when I want to and

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,420
then come back off and not everybody in

00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,130
that channel has to be on my team all

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:15,569
right art of my department right we can

00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:19,259
have slack channels that are communities

00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:21,269
of interest around a specific topic same

00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:23,610
thing we github right like um you know

00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,220
or your internal source control system

00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,529
right like you can go find other teams

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,089
projects you can open pull requests you

00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:32,399
can open feature requests you can

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:34,199
identify issues right and and again you

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,910
can make that connection for a while

00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,740
establish communication and back back

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,220
off right it's the open source has

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,170
actually trained us

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,120
and pointed a way that we can do some of

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,040
these things as well and start to take

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,220
advantage of these new tools that we

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,470
have this is this is a really

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,439
interesting one and I think one of the

00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:57,329
most compelling things about complex

00:15:53,439 --> 00:15:59,500
systems so so so these are termites and

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,649
and the interesting thing about termites

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,680
is that that they can build these really

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:08,470
elaborate termite mounds right that are

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:12,670
they're really quite large even though

00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:14,769
an individual termite is is sort of you

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,699
know well it's not even relatively

00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:18,519
straightforward right because even a

00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,870
termite is a complex system but but you

00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,149
know I'm pretty sure there's no chief

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,339
software termite right that is designing

00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:27,009
how this thing is working and in fact

00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:29,410
the termite mound arises just out of the

00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:31,420
interactions of the termites themselves

00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,000
right and so so in particular there's an

00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,529
emergent behavior and what this really

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,540
means is that when you think about the

00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:39,850
behavior of the system you can't

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,470
actually understand all of its behavior

00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,709
just by understanding the in the

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,120
behavior of the individual components so

00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:47,680
how many you know I think we asked this

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,149
before but how many people have had an

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,720
outage in your service that was caused

00:16:49,149 --> 00:16:54,129
because some of their service changed

00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:58,029
right or your customers did something

00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:59,410
unusual right and so how many people you

00:16:58,029 --> 00:17:03,670
know think back to the last production

00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:07,839
outage you have you had four how many of

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:09,010
you was that a surprise right even even

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,600
if there was even it was a change

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,490
related incident right I went and I

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,439
pushed a change in production and it

00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:16,089
caused an outage I was probably really

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,539
surprised that that caused an outage

00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:21,730
right you know a big big part of a lot

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,829
of after-action reviews where we

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:26,350
understand what's going on is is having

00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,880
people say I didn't know I didn't know

00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:30,340
that would happen or I didn't know it

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:32,380
worked that way so if you've been

00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,450
following John all spa and the Stella

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,820
report that he published was it a couple

00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:39,250
years ago now he talks about this

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,650
principle of dark debt which is the idea

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:44,380
that we actually don't have full

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,970
understanding of what's going on this is

00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,500
this is actually I think one of the

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,020
critical things it makes dealing with

00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:53,380
complex systems really hard for us

00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:55,630
my uncle is a retired professor of

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:58,179
anthropology and one of things he said

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:00,730
to me one time is one of the main things

00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,460
holding back human society is that we

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:07,320
only have 1400 cubic centimetres of

00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:10,300
brain like we we actually have finite

00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,980
processing capabilities and what's

00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:16,110
really interesting is that we are we are

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:19,150
building we are building systems that is

00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:21,250
literally actually impossible for one

00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,900
person to understand because we simply

00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,160
don't have enough computing power to

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,280
understand all of the things that are

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,440
going on here so but nonetheless there

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,040
are plenty of successful companies that

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,420
make lots of money and and you know make

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,640
their customers happy as well

00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,860
and so what do we do about this right so

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,800
a big part is that if our systems are

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,510
going to exhibit surprising behavior

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,720
when they get changed it's really

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:48,730
important for us to have some good

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,620
indicators of what's going on right like

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,420
all of those gauges in a cockpit right

00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:54,820
like this is these are all in a plane

00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:58,690
that actually like mostly flies itself

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:01,150
right and so you know think you know

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,740
what kind of information do you have

00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:05,200
about your systems this is this is

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:07,390
really why you know whether you call it

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,640
operational visibility or observability

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:12,400
that's why this is so critical for

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:15,309
modern systems these days is because our

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:18,160
systems will surprise us and we need to

00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:21,429
be able to see what is going on because

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,870
what's going on is likely if we if we

00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:23,890
care about it and are sort of anxious

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,120
about what's going on it's because

00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:28,179
something is going on that we didn't

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,480
expect so it's really important to lean

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:33,429
into this type of instrumentation

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:37,809
complex systems also I have a property

00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:39,760
and which we'll talk about of where

00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:41,530
where you can have snowball effects

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,809
right so just like if I start a snowball

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,929
at the top of the mountain I get an

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:49,420
avalanche at the bottom complex systems

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,370
often have nonlinear effects right so

00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:54,490
there's the idea that a small change can

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,559
end up having a large impact again

00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,270
because they're unexpected things we

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,220
have the cascading failures where things

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,820
are interconnected by all these networks

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,170
of interactions so so any any change

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:08,560
can actually have a pretty large blast

00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:12,100
radius and so what that means is if the

00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:14,110
impact of a change can be magnified that

00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,550
that suggests that we have to take sort

00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:18,820
of a different strategy here right which

00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:21,340
is that oh maybe we want to make smaller

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:23,830
changes right so if that's bad when it

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,320
gets amplified it's not as bad as if we

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:28,540
made that same change in a big way and

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,430
it got amplified right so we want to

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:34,510
start making smaller changes because

00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:35,620
these could be unpredictable and but but

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,180
at the same time we still want to get

00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,490
stuff done right it's still really

00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:41,410
important to to ship features and remain

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,120
competitive in the marketplace and so

00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:44,170
we're gonna have smaller changes but we

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,410
want to get the same amount of stuff

00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:49,060
done guess what we have to change do

00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:51,190
those changes more frequently right so

00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,290
this is all about smaller changes more

00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,940
frequently that's actually just driven

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:56,680
directly by the complexity of the

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,440
systems that we have this is really the

00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,180
only safe way to do this and so this is

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,790
why things like continuous delivery are

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,530
so important and leaning into being able

00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,510
to make a small change get that out to

00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,480
production this is why we do things like

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:12,460
canary deployments right where I can

00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,710
shape traffic so a new version of a

00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:18,460
service only gets seen by a small

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,200
portion of my customer base and then as

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,120
I get more confidence that that change

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:23,980
is working well rolling it out more

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:25,810
effectively right these are you know

00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,950
here at a DevOps conference where you

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:28,960
know a lot of times we talk about

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,550
processes and tools this is one of the

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,950
big things that we should be thinking

00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,420
through is how can I make smaller

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:36,150
changes and get them out to production

00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:39,430
more quickly

00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,320
all right so so those are sort of some

00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:44,290
of the core properties of complex

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,660
systems hopefully I have convinced you

00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,820
that these are the types of systems that

00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:52,480
you actually go and work on on a regular

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:57,490
basis and and so I just I kind of want

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,980
to make an observation which is that you

00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:03,700
know we have you know we're talking

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:05,290
about dev dev ops right as as sort of

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,080
bringing together two communities right

00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:10,090
the dev community the ops community and

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,670
when I think sometimes about you know

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:15,520
seeing what well what do we do like what

00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:17,159
are we actually doing right here it's

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:21,749
like okay I

00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:25,200
build and operated software right but

00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:28,019
but the reality is this is this is a way

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:31,649
of thinking about the problem that

00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:35,039
actually assumes that we're in a

00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:36,659
complicated domain this is the idea that

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,799
I can make a code change and I actually

00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:40,259
know how that's gonna behave in

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,450
production right just like I can get my

00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,889
high school physics textbook I can drop

00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:46,679
the remote and I can tell you how long

00:22:43,889 --> 00:22:48,389
it's going to take to hit the bottom you

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,950
know there was a time when our the

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:51,989
software industry was more like a

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,119
complicated problem right back in the

00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:56,759
days of shrink-wrap software right where

00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:00,179
hey that that program only runs on one

00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:03,210
computer right and you know and it fit

00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,729
on you know three five and a quarter

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:07,109
floppy disks right it's like I believe

00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:08,519
there was one person you could actually

00:23:07,109 --> 00:23:10,379
understand everything that was going on

00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,029
in that software right but now the

00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:14,879
software that we write interacts with

00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:18,239
all kinds of things right you know if we

00:23:14,879 --> 00:23:22,049
run mobile apps those run on on hardware

00:23:18,239 --> 00:23:24,149
that we don't directly control right you

00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:25,409
know to some degree like even running in

00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:27,179
a cloud provider but like we don't

00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:28,799
control all of the things that are going

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:29,580
on there right there's lots of

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,049
interactions

00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,999
everything is on it you know almost

00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:35,639
everything's on the internet right we

00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:37,619
can have bad actors right like the the

00:23:35,639 --> 00:23:40,320
reason you know we see DDoS attacks

00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:44,220
right that that actually interrupt a lot

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,409
of service and so I think my my main

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,269
thesis is that you know the software

00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:50,039
industry started in this complicated

00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:52,590
problem domain and a lot of the ways

00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:56,009
that we think and even talk about what

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:57,509
we do trace their roots to this way of

00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:59,759
thinking about the problem just the fact

00:23:57,509 --> 00:24:02,639
that we say build and operate we're that

00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:05,759
we have dev and ops as separate things

00:24:02,639 --> 00:24:08,489
and and I think we can't do that anymore

00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,139
and I think this is actually this is

00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,799
actually one of the main drivers of

00:24:10,139 --> 00:24:14,489
DevOps

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,779
is that the reason these groups of

00:24:14,489 --> 00:24:18,779
people need to come together and

00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:21,200
collaborate much more closely is that we

00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:25,529
don't build and operate software anymore

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,179
what we do is we evolve production and

00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,849
that's actually the right way to think

00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:31,049
about what we do and so it's that

00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:34,470
mindset shift

00:24:31,049 --> 00:24:37,049
mindset shift where you know we realize

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,269
that hay production is this complex

00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:40,889
system that when we change it it's going

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:42,989
to have unpredictable behavior right

00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,739
that you know things are gonna come talk

00:24:42,989 --> 00:24:45,360
to production

00:24:43,739 --> 00:24:48,269
alright whether those are bad actors or

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,149
customers doing surprising things you

00:24:48,269 --> 00:24:52,230
know or even just the security

00:24:50,149 --> 00:24:54,419
researcher that reveals a vulnerability

00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:56,669
in a key project right where it's like

00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:58,139
hey anybody remember heartbleed right

00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,549
it's like hey we kind of have to go and

00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:02,489
like do a bunch of stuff we didn't plan

00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:04,139
on doing right so I think this is the

00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:06,450
right way to now think about the way

00:25:04,139 --> 00:25:08,220
that we're we're working and I think I

00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:09,720
think in some ways you know when we

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:12,059
think about DevOps and the things that

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,129
we talk about here a lot of the reasons

00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:15,720
behind why we're having these

00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:17,840
conversations and why this is so

00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,159
important to many companies is that

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,659
whether we explicitly acknowledge it or

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,730
not I think through experience we're

00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,070
beginning to understand that that this

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:31,590
is the right way of thinking about what

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:33,600
we do so just to wrap up as I said we

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,789
have a complex systems problem and we

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,820
need to talk first part of solution is

00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:41,429
admitting that you have a problem and so

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:43,320
you know I think if there's one thing

00:25:41,429 --> 00:25:45,779
that you taken away from this talk today

00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:48,210
it is recognizing that in fact our

00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,100
systems are complex and that it's

00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,929
important for us to realize that they as

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:54,419
a result that they require different

00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:58,169
ways of dealing with them you know our

00:25:54,419 --> 00:26:00,749
systems are not merely complicated you

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:03,600
know in those frames and so so we really

00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:06,720
do have to adapt and and and generally

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,759
you know the main takeaway is that debin

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,379
ops are not separable activities in fact

00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,960
they're no but you can't separate these

00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:15,059
things effectively because it's really

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,399
on the on the sharp edge of production

00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,869
changes that that that's where all of

00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:21,739
the action is and we have to orient

00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:23,609
ourselves around thinking through

00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:27,749
interacting with that system and

00:26:23,609 --> 00:26:33,200
evolving it so so with that I've got

00:26:27,749 --> 00:26:33,200
time for questions so thanks

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:42,679
we make the argument that the software

00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:45,020
development lifecycle is chaotic so so

00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,150
you could make that argument I think

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:51,049
that's a that's kind of a bleak

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:53,720
worldview which which mate I mean it may

00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,429
be right you know that in a chaotic

00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,860
system you basically just have to try

00:26:55,429 --> 00:27:00,590
stuff and hope it works I'm not sure

00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:04,669
we're quite there yet I think we do

00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:07,570
there there are lots of lots of good

00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:11,649
examples and and I think we're gonna see

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:14,690
more more control theory brought into

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:16,279
the software world so you know we

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:18,200
referring back to that airliner you know

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,059
without you know very complex autopilot

00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:23,750
there's there's actually a whole history

00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:25,390
of a pre effective control systems a

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,440
really good example that I would like to

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:32,450
think about sometimes there's something

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:34,940
called a pig controller PID and and this

00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:37,490
is able to effectively control a system

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,039
with that understanding how it works and

00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:42,380
so a good example would be the cruise

00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:43,730
control in your car all right that that

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,870
is said that effectively works this way

00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,090
right so it's like I know I have a

00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:48,590
target speed and I just compare my

00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,140
current speed to the target speed I

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:52,520
don't have to understand and if I'm not

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,620
going fast enough I push down on the

00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,960
accelerator some more and if I'm going

00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:59,210
too fast I let off the accelerator and

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,380
so I don't have to understand you know I

00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,480
don't have to understand how the engine

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:04,820
works I don't have to understand whether

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,799
I'm going up or down hill or any of

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:10,399
those things so so there are I think

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:12,380
mechanisms for effectively controlling

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,559
systems that that we don't understand

00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:17,330
and so it's what I'm still hopeful and

00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,380
and I don't think that when we make

00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,330
production changes although we're

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:22,279
surprised a lot we actually make a lot

00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:24,440
of successful production changes right

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:26,690
like it's not like our hypothesis about

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,730
what's going to happen is you know it's

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:31,940
just not a hundred percent correct right

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,039
but it's often very likely correct right

00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,690
this is why lots of these companies are

00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:36,740
able to be successful and still be in

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,299
business even with this level of

00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,909
complexity so so I'm not convinced we're

00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,549
all the way to chaos yet but but I guess

00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:46,730
we'll see thank you for your

00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:48,470
presentation so first question is what

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:51,590
some of the tools that you like to use

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:54,320
to help manage complex your complex

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:57,350
systems and second do you have the URL

00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,230
for the federated search github project

00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,400
that you're starting oh no so I alright

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,350
so I'll answer the second problem of

00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:05,330
course which is I think this would be a

00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:07,040
great I think this would be a great open

00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,960
source project so so hasn't been started

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:13,340
yet but but maybe I need to go like

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:15,320
create ones but anyway as far as some of

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,750
the tools for just sort of dealing with

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,429
these complex systems you know I do you

00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,200
think leaning into operational

00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:23,360
visibility tooling is really important

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,090
so this is where things like you know

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,179
log analysis you know the elk stack for

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:31,220
example is a good example of ways to do

00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:32,450
that with with open source products or

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,679
of course commercial products in this

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:35,990
space

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,970
collecting application metrics I'm using

00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:40,520
things for example like Prometheus is a

00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,250
good example of of ways to get some of

00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,309
those gauges and dials for the cockpit

00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:48,350
so to speak distributed tracing again I

00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:51,320
think I think I think that that's sort

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,490
of the next step beyond that where you

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,100
know I think you want to get some of the

00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:56,720
basics in place first before distributed

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,240
tracing where you can actually see what

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,429
happened to something as it bounces

00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,500
around your complex system but there are

00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:05,630
even more advanced tools that really

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:09,650
rely more on introspection right so like

00:30:05,630 --> 00:30:11,480
seeing like that that part of my system

00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:12,799
is not working well and can I go see

00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:16,850
what's going on with it

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:18,260
um interestingly the you know there are

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:22,970
a lot of people that say like you should

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:25,580
never SSH into production and and and I

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,049
and I think that's that's meant in the

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:29,390
right way which is that you shouldn't

00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:31,309
have to SSH into production to make your

00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:32,780
changes right the idea is like hey I

00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:35,419
want to drive these in automated fashion

00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,250
I should have all the metrics and things

00:30:35,419 --> 00:30:39,919
set up so that I can get some good ideas

00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:42,320
but it turns out guess what there's all

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,570
these amazing tools from the history of

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,919
UNIX that are on your Linux server that

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,850
tell you what's going on with that thing

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,250
and so I think that you know I think

00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:55,100
generally you should probably not be SS

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:57,950
aging and making changes to what's going

00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:59,419
on but I think Association into

00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,700
something to see what's going on is is

00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:02,320
actually a major part of

00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,659
tool box that we shouldn't necessarily

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,190
shy away from because sometimes that's

00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:11,109
really the only way to get that type of

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:14,799
understanding that you're looking for so

00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:17,169
thinking of especially like the concept

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,239
of emergence and thinking of of course

00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:20,859
like Conway's Game of Life which you

00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:24,509
know we see emergent patterns from a

00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:26,739
simple set of rules how could if we

00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:29,080
because a lot of the talk was thinking

00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:32,789
about shifting the the approach or

00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:35,440
mindset and so how would that impact

00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:37,659
software architecture design if we

00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,669
approach things not intending for

00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:42,639
outcomes but intending for like that

00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:44,950
some patterns will emerge from set core

00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:48,179
set of principles yeah so this is this

00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:51,070
is something I think about a lot because

00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,840
you know the especially in my role um

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,070
you know that they call me the chief

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:57,190
software architect but there are

00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,379
thousands of engineers working you know

00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,919
in the organization that I'm part of I

00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:04,539
guarantee I don't know even half of the

00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,940
ones that exist I don't even know they

00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:09,549
exist right it's it's not possible to do

00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,249
this so I think for architecture I think

00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:13,840
what you start to think through is is

00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:16,389
starting to think through more about

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,119
rules right and and like you know you

00:32:16,389 --> 00:32:21,059
mentioned the game of life right and how

00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,919
can I tweak rules in such a way that

00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:25,899
that I can cause the right properties to

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,999
emerge as the way to start thinking

00:32:25,899 --> 00:32:30,220
about that one of the things that that

00:32:27,999 --> 00:32:31,779
we've been working on inside Comcast's

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:34,119
is we have a we have an architecture

00:32:31,779 --> 00:32:37,539
guild this actually works a lot like the

00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,309
IETF but as we see the need for trying

00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:41,649
to drive a little more commonality and

00:32:39,309 --> 00:32:42,850
in some parts of our tech stack we've

00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:44,830
actually opened that up and there's a

00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:46,419
grassroots effort that goes into it so

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,820
we say like hey we'd like to pick a CI

00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:50,379
CD system right like if you care about

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:52,149
it you can show up and participate in

00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:54,220
that decision-making process right and

00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:55,779
we had hundreds of people that's an

00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,609
example of one that we did recently and

00:32:55,779 --> 00:33:00,700
so we had hundreds of people that that

00:32:57,609 --> 00:33:03,940
showed up to provide their use cases to

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,889
suggest things that we can evaluate and

00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,809
so I think it is actually it's more like

00:33:05,889 --> 00:33:10,210
leaning into the advantage of the

00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:11,980
complex system which is that I'm gonna

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:13,990
have a lot of independent sort of

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:15,280
interactions because like an individual

00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:18,340
that's running a micro service the

00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,630
Darracq complex system and so so that's

00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:22,240
where I think through things like they

00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:24,250
meet you know the the MIT the federated

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,710
search right and the meeting minutes and

00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:29,200
and how do I sort of take advantage of

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:31,360
the broad learning that's going on how

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,120
do I think through examples of things

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,740
and and where in some sense you know I

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:37,480
sometimes say a big part of what I do is

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,210
reverse engineer the operating system of

00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:41,470
the company that I work for right so you

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:44,230
need to understand how our decisions

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,550
made had a budgets work how the hiring

00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:48,820
decisions get made because guess what

00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:50,500
all those things can impact the way that

00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,200
your system evolves in the way that your

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:56,710
teams behave and sometimes just you know

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,620
for example figuring out that oh if I

00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:01,809
take this service and instead of it

00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:03,220
having its own budget I change that so

00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:05,110
that they charge their internal

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,139
customers back right for what they do

00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,760
it's like just that one change can all

00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:13,780
of a sudden induce all of the behavior

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,820
that you're looking for and so so it is

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,110
thinking more in terms of the the rules

00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:19,450
of interaction and the rules of

00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:22,149
engagement is I think what sort of

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:24,970
architecture is becoming these days yeah

00:34:22,149 --> 00:34:26,710
so the question was release it sounded

00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:28,210
really good for those stability patterns

00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:30,730
is there a companion volume for

00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:33,399
complexity theory this is where I admit

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:36,240
to you that that I relied heavily on the

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:38,889
Wikipedia article for this which I think

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,300
I think actually I would recommend that

00:34:38,889 --> 00:34:41,470
you go there like there is actually a

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,530
lot more information there

00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:46,869
we're not complexity theorists right so

00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,460
so while you know certainly like there's

00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:51,250
tons of textbooks I don't have one that

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,710
I can recommend to you I do think that

00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,359
it is you know it's certainly worthwhile

00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:58,359
to go and understand those sorts of

00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,520
things for us I mean I I've been more

00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:03,869
satisfied with just sort of recognizing

00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,100
that that we're in this domain now and

00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:07,630
and to some degree some of the solutions

00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,040
are going to be specific to the

00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:12,670
particular setting that we're in right

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,710
so it's like okay not you know github

00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,390
right okay that's a specific thing for

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,340
source control right do other industries

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,109
do other complex systems have something

00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,780
that works exactly the same way you know

00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:25,600
I don't know but but that's one that

00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,890
exists in our environment that you know

00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,280
that we can think through how to

00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:32,260
interact

00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,770
to us all right thank you very much chef

00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,770
