Description: 
	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - Creating a Culture of Inclusion by Jeremy Hayes 

We talk a lot about creating a DevOps culture within an organization. While this conversation usually focuses around technology and delivery challenges, it also helps to look more broadly at how to create a culture of inclusion. When I think about a culture of inclusion, I imagine organizational customs, beliefs, and actions that truly honor and welcome all individuals. To me, such a culture encompasses a multitude of factors, including race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, mental health, religion, ethnic and cultural background, and socioeconomic status.

As a white gay dad to two kids of color and as someone who used to do diversity training for a living, I’m acutely aware of issues of difference, and racial prejudice and profiling happen everywhere, everyday. I feel that I have two important duties to my children in this regard. First, prepare them to live in a world where people will likely see and treat them differently because of the color of their skin. Second, do my small part to change that world – one person and one organization at a time.

In this talk, I’ll provide some ways you can help foster a culture of inclusion within your own organization. Whether you’re the token member of an underrepresented group or if you’re just trying to make your organization more welcoming, you’ll find some strategies you can start using today.

I've started doing conference talks I'm

00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:23,869
really excited about it my mom is also

00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:25,730
really excited about it

00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:26,930
so would you do me a favor and take a

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,509
selfie with me so that I could actually

00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:31,460
show her that we did this all right all

00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:33,860
right here we go hold on switch around

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:39,559
Dave there you go all right everybody

00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:46,489
say hi mom awesome thank you you're the

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:48,920
best audience ever okay so hi I want to

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,170
talk to you about creating a culture of

00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:53,839
inclusion and doesn't that just sound

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:57,409
really nice sort of like free donuts or

00:00:53,839 --> 00:01:00,039
world peace there are lots of reasons

00:00:57,409 --> 00:01:02,989
that this is important to me personally

00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,900
in my past lives I've been a queer

00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:08,750
activist a social justice educator an

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:11,990
out gay man and just somebody who cares

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,900
about humanity but then I became a

00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:16,760
father and now these two little

00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,450
delightful children when they're not

00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,250
terrorizing my life constantly have me

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,460
thinking about what I can be doing to

00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:27,770
make the world a better place for them

00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:29,420
because let's face it we live in a world

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:30,890
where people are treated differently

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,070
because of who they are and how they

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:36,770
look some people like to say that we

00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,620
live in a colorblind society or we've

00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:40,820
moved beyond seeing race but the people

00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,000
who are saying that are not the people

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,400
who experience racism on a daily basis

00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,790
and we've all seen the headlines about

00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,110
how tech has a diversity problem many of

00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,690
us in the room have probably felt it

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,030
ourselves either being personally

00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:59,480
discriminated against or just feeling

00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:02,360
left out or you've looked around your

00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:06,220
organization and noticed wow everybody

00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:10,340
here looks just like me or conversely

00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,980
nobody here looks like me according to

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,989
research from Glassdoor 67% of job

00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:16,129
seekers consider workplace diversity an

00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,560
important factor when they're

00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,140
considering job opportunities and more

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,150
than 50% of current employees want their

00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,350
workplace to do a better job of

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,390
increasing diversity

00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,709
but what we know is just getting people

00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,270
in the room with different

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,520
characteristics doesn't solve the

00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,770
problem it's a start

00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,590
don't get me wrong but we need to take a

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:43,590
hard look at the culture and what we're

00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:45,640
doing or not doing to be truly inclusive

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,820
when I talk about a culture of inclusion

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:52,420
I mean a place where the organization

00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,360
customs beliefs and actions truly honor

00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:57,310
and welcome all individuals where

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,050
factors like race gender sexual

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:00,580
orientation gender identity disability

00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:02,170
status cultural background body shape

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,790
and size mental health religion ethnic

00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,790
and cultural background socioeconomic

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,330
status all of these things don't prevent

00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:11,920
someone from being fully involved a

00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,500
place where people are not just invited

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,380
in but are truly made a part of the

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,890
organization it's about creating a sense

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:23,080
of belonging so today I want to suggest

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,760
to you some things that you can do to

00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:27,790
help create this culture within your own

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:29,170
organizations just like joseline

00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,610
reminded us this morning that we can

00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,190
push our organizations to be more

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:37,209
ethical I would say we can also push

00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:40,200
them to be more inclusive the first

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:43,989
thing you can do is just to be yourself

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,790
you are valuable you bring a unique set

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:48,100
of talents and perspectives to your

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:50,079
organization and you should feel

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,840
comfortable bringing all the aspects of

00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:55,420
your identity with you to work when we

00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,530
are our whole authentic selves we make

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:01,329
it easier for others to do the same and

00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,200
if we're going to truly value difference

00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:07,600
we need to make it visible when our

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,079
culture is truly inclusive the parts of

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,540
our identity that make us unique become

00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:16,959
common and ordinary rather than strange

00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,209
or exotic for example I talked about my

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,709
husband in casual conversation just as

00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:23,530
much as my co-workers talk about their

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:25,900
opposite sex partners it should be

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,280
completely normal to ask for an adjusted

00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,340
work schedule because you're fasting

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,950
during Ramadan we all need to feel

00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,479
comfortable expressing ourselves so that

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:36,479
we can feel safe and included

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,400
last month I attended Hoshi comp and

00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:44,730
when I was there I heard a Hoshi core

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,540
engineer talking about how he

00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,910
unintentionally triggered a movement

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,290
within the organization that led to the

00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:54,370
creation of Pride stickers and other

00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:56,440
swag just because he asked he wanted to

00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:59,200
be visible as a queer person in tech and

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:02,850
in doing so he created a space that made

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,670
it easier for others to do the same

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,320
it's not always easy especially if you

00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,900
feel like you're the only person like

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,810
you but sometimes I think you'll be

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:16,960
surprised what you'll find when you ask

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:18,870
and then if you work at an organization

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,070
that doesn't respect you for who you are

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,600
try to find allies within the

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,150
organization that can help you bring

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,890
about the change necessary and if that

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,890
doesn't work it might be time to look

00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,270
for a different organization now for

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,220
some of us that's easier said than done

00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:35,169
I know that I'm speaking from a place of

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,730
privilege as a syst white male who's

00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:39,930
pretty established of my career and not

00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:39,930
all of us can take those kinds of risks

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,990
the second thing you can do is be

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,979
mindful of the words you use every day

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,350
I'm not talking about political

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:55,330
correctness I'm talking about being

00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,630
aware of the language that you use and

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:02,350
how it may impact people for starters

00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:04,780
use gender-neutral terms I have a

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:08,770
co-worker from California who calls

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,450
everybody dude or bro and every sentence

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:14,080
either starts with dude or ends with bro

00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:16,120
and he's trying really hard to change

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,810
but like any other habit it's hard to

00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,000
break or take my husband for example he

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,290
often talks about how his father and I'm

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,840
sure a lot of people's fathers did the

00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:27,400
same always taught him that the polite

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,060
way to address a group of women was

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,979
ladies hello ladies how are you today

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,500
well that can be perceived as diminutive

00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:36,550
or condescending and you also don't know

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,930
if everybody in the group actually

00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:43,570
identifies as a lady there are lots of

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,870
alternatives and like anything else that

00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:47,860
takes practice so I encourage you to try

00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:49,010
it out while you're here at the

00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:51,270
conference

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:54,090
but you have to give yourself permission

00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:57,030
to make mistakes because that's what

00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:00,000
matters the trying that's what signals

00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:01,890
hey I get it and I'm working on being

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,300
more inclusive it's not about being

00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:06,390
perfect and getting it right all the

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,420
time I'm standing up here doing this

00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:12,090
talk I did it to other conferences and I

00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,320
watched the video recently and I noticed

00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:16,530
that the first thing I did when I walked

00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,430
on stage was I said hey guys you have to

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,370
give yourself permission to make

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:24,750
mistakes because even that opens up the

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:26,070
opportunity for further dialogue and I

00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:27,680
can't talk about gender inclusive

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,790
language without mentioning pronouns

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,710
with singer Sam Smith recently

00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:34,560
announcing their pronouns it's a bit of

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:37,340
a hot topic at the moment we need to

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,960
respect how people choose to identify

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,419
and it's another opportunity to make

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,919
things more visible I've started

00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,169
including my pronouns and my email

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,490
signature my Twitter bio you can get the

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,970
stickers at registration to put them on

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:53,460
your name badge when everyone is

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,080
explicit about their pronouns including

00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,270
the people whose gender isn't typically

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,740
called into question it actually makes

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,050
it more comfortable for someone who

00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,700
identifies as non-binary or whose

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,700
presentation might not match their

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:09,110
pronouns to self-identify and asked to

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,110
be called what they want to be called

00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,940
the third thing you can do is get to

00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,810
know people as individuals and treat

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:21,180
them as such you are a complete complex

00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,260
person with a multifaceted identity and

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,180
so are all of your coworkers

00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:28,800
try not to rely on stereotypes based on

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,210
someone's appearance or background to

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
let them determine how you interact with

00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,000
them at the end of the day we're all

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,979
individuals with our own unique blend of

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,800
nature and nurture that govern how our

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:42,510
personalities manifest when we start

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,880
treating some people differently or

00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,350
excluding them we miss out on the value

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,820
that they bring to our organizations a

00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:53,520
good friend of mine Vernon wall who does

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:56,520
diversity training talks about the tape

00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,570
recorder that plays in our heads now for

00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,770
you young uns who don't know what that

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,770
is think a Spotify playlist

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,370
these are the messages that we picked up

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,970
as we were growing up from our families

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,020
our school our church wherever there are

00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:14,070
things that you noticed even

00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:15,540
subconsciously maybe it was observing

00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:16,830
how people will be treated differently

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,950
based on how they looked or where they

00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:22,080
were from or even explicit messages like

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:25,260
being told a particular group is lazy or

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,330
women belong in the kitchen all these

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,180
messages were recorded on the track in

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,920
your head and it's constantly playing in

00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,610
the background without you even really

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,520
noticing so when you see someone walking

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:40,380
down the street who looks a certain way

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,330
without thinking about it you draw on

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,100
all those messages and make assumptions

00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:48,780
about that person and this is

00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:51,180
unconscious bias it's very hard to undo

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,730
that programming because it's often

00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,250
rooted in fear superstition or ignorance

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,230
and usually the people we pick those

00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,910
messages up from with the people we came

00:09:58,230 --> 00:10:03,090
to trust and believe in the most when we

00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,790
were young using my husband as an

00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,200
example again he talks about the

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,740
messages that he got from his mother

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,780
that anyone who doesn't like animals is

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:14,780
evil and you can't trust men who wear

00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,280
pink earrings

00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,480
obviously these are silly I mean maybe

00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,690
there's a little bit of truth in there

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,090
I'm not sure but that's unconscious bias

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:30,150
that's constantly playing on some level

00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:34,200
but you can undo this too it requires a

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:36,360
lot of self-awareness it can be helpful

00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,500
to ask your colleagues or your friends

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:42,300
what they think your biases are having

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:43,920
open and honest conversations about the

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,500
biases that other people see us

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,420
displaying can reveal our bias blind

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,410
spots so that we can become more aware

00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,490
and take them into consideration this is

00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:55,950
something else you can work on here

00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,030
during the conference try to notice when

00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,340
you're making an assumption about

00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:01,830
someone that you don't know and think

00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:03,120
about where it's coming from what are

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:08,610
the messages that are playing in your

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:10,650
head according to the National Alliance

00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,810
of mental illness about one in five

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,080
adults in the u.s. experience some kind

00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,070
of mental illness in a given year

00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:19,290
some mental illnesses are more

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,690
debilitating than others but the reality

00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:23,810
is most of us will be impacted by our

00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:26,520
mental health at some point or another

00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:28,490
and this can include illnesses like

00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,120
depression and anxiety or

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,080
neurodevelopmental disorders like

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,420
learning disorders and autism the fourth

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:38,190
thing you can do is practice empathy and

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,820
compassion for your co-workers who might

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,690
be struggling with any of these issues

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:47,130
for most of us our jobs are stressful

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,130
usually it's a positive kind of stress

00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:52,190
that helps us get better on our work and

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:55,110
challenge us as challenges us to improve

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,450
but what we need to understand is that

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:01,350
we all come to work with different

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:03,330
experiences and needs for me standing up

00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:05,810
here doing public speaking is stressful

00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:08,760
I mean just check my heart rate monitor

00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:16,980
but for someone with anxiety it could be

00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:19,410
really hard at almost impossible educate

00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:22,320
yourself about the signs that someone

00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,240
might be struggling pay attention to

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,920
your co-workers and what's going on with

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,930
them and find ways that work for you to

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,460
reach out to them you don't need to be a

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,230
therapist or have a degree in counseling

00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,900
to check in with someone and see if they

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,910
need help just asking a simple question

00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,460
let someone know that you care about

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,920
them and want them to find the help that

00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,780
they need and it's probably best not to

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,430
try to give advice yourself but rather

00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,660
help someone find the resources that

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,220
they need open sourcing mental illness

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,020
is a great resource to learn more about

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,910
mental health and tech and they have

00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:59,430
several resources and videos on their

00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:01,470
website and right here in Philadelphia

00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:03,210
there's an organization that provides

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,460
mental health first aid training

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,170
sessions so you can learn to spot the

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,060
signs of behavioral health issues and

00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,650
provide help you can even take a free

00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:13,580
online screening to assess your own

00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:13,580
behavioral health

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,140
talking openly about mental health can

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,500
help to reduce the stigma around it and

00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,000
contribute to a more inclusive culture

00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,130
I'll tell pretty much anybody who will

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,690
listen that between my husband and I we

00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,680
see two individual therapist and a

00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:33,060
couples therapist every month

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,270
be sure to take the time for self care

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:39,210
too we all know that burnout is a real

00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:41,850
thing if your company allows for mental

00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:44,280
health days or has unlimited pto take

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,720
advantage of it when you need it and be

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:51,450
as open as you feel comfortable with

00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,490
your supervisor about your needs the

00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:56,070
fifth thing you can do is pay attention

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,720
to the people in your organization whose

00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:00,120
voices and perspectives are being

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,790
marginalized it's likely not even

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:05,030
intentional but how often have we been

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,320
sitting sitting in a meeting room and

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:10,710
one of your female colleagues presents

00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,210
an idea two minutes later some bro

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,790
says the exact same thing and it was

00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:17,060
like oh he's a genius right this happens

00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,060
all the time

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:22,110
those of us with privilege have a

00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:24,690
responsibility to take notice and do

00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:27,840
something about it so the next time that

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:29,790
female colleague speaks up chime in with

00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:31,530
hey that sounds really interesting

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,670
tell us more before somebody else can

00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:37,890
co-op the idea we can't expect someone

00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,860
who's being marginalized to always be

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,330
able to advocate for themselves if you

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:45,150
have colleagues who you think might not

00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:47,250
be being included check in with them and

00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:53,160
see how they're doing and think about

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:54,570
ways that you can be an ally it's

00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,490
important to have a working environment

00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:59,730
that's accessible to individuals with

00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:02,150
physical disabilities but creating a

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,680
welcoming space goes further than that

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,570
go beyond thinking about accommodation

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,430
and instead look at inclusive design

00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:10,440
which focuses on making environments

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:14,160
universally accessible and looks beyond

00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,990
disability think about with what someone

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,750
with different needs from you might need

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:21,870
and make that the norm rather than the

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,280
exception that they have to request this

00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:24,990
not only helps the person that might

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,220
need it the accommodation but it's also

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,860
a clear signal of inclusion

00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,390
make your slide decks and websites that

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:33,790
are easy to read by people with low

00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:35,860
vision provide your trainings and

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,240
workshops in a variety of modes for

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:41,520
people with different learning styles

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,960
and it's not just about disabilities

00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:46,450
encourage your company to have lactation

00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,910
rooms nap rooms prayer meditation rooms

00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,520
these all make your space more welcoming

00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:53,080
for everybody the goal is to make sure

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,680
that everyone is able to fully

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,630
participate at another conference I was

00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:03,220
out recently they were announcing lunch

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:05,020
and they were describing the options

00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:07,120
they said we have this this chicken

00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:09,100
sandwich on a whole-wheat wrap and we

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,660
have the sandwich on brioche and it's

00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,890
all great and then we have some

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:16,750
vegetarian thing later in the day I was

00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:19,570
speaking with one of the attendees who

00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:21,160
had the vegetarian option and she said

00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,570
that she should have known the way they

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,940
described it that it was completely an

00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:27,160
afterthought and she wished she'd gone

00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,600
out and found her own much I can tell

00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:33,460
you she wasn't feeling very included

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:36,040
that day if you're involved in the

00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:38,950
hiring process in your organization take

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,690
a critical look at your processes how

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:41,470
diverse are the individuals in your

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,020
candidate pool

00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,670
how can you actively reach out to

00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:48,820
candidates who have traditionally been

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,120
underrepresented find organizations like

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:54,100
Project northstar hearing excuse me here

00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,940
in Philadelphia and hire their amazing

00:16:54,100 --> 00:17:00,970
amazing engineers remember that

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,860
unconscious bias we talked about be

00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:05,829
really mindful of it in your interview

00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:09,520
process for example we know from some

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:11,530
research that those with quote ethnic

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,600
sounding names in Western countries are

00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,670
less likely to even be selected for

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,970
interviews just based on the name on

00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:21,010
their resume notice when you are

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,040
evaluating candidates differently based

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:25,839
on their identity if you see a female

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,339
candidate and a male candidate exhibit

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,820
the same behavior do you treat them

00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:33,280
differently make sure that your

00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,610
evaluation criteria are objective and

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,230
clear and consider out how offering anti

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,250
bias training for your recruiting dreams

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:43,300
and hiring manager

00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:45,400
and after hiring do you have clear

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:49,270
objectives and explicit criteria for

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,980
promotions and reviews without a lot

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,660
without clearly defined expectations

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:58,420
that makes it really easy for that

00:17:52,660 --> 00:18:00,400
unconscious bias to creep back in often

00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:01,870
at these conferences like Clinton

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,000
mentioned this morning we have codes of

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,180
conduct that call out what behavior is

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,560
acceptable and what is not

00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,490
encourage your organization to have one

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:13,990
and make it public people who are likely

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,390
to experience harassment or have

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,130
experienced it in the past will be more

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:19,930
likely to join your organization if they

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:23,610
feel it's going to be a safe place for

00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:23,610
them where harassment won't be tolerated

00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,080
the 2018 women in the workplace report

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,450
found that only 27 percent of employees

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,100
say that managers regularly challenge

00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:36,070
biased language and behavior when they

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,720
observe it and only 40 percent say that

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,690
disrespectful behavior toward women is

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:43,030
quickly addressed by their company only

00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,470
32 percent think that their company

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,790
swiftly acts on claims of sexual

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:51,760
harassment but it's not just sexual

00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:54,250
harassment we need to be aware of don't

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,920
tolerate jokes about mental disorders or

00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:00,760
biased language about women racial

00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:02,290
groups LGBT people anything when you see

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,440
behavior that's inappropriate or

00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:12,130
disrespectful speak up change won't come

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:14,020
if we're all silent finally take the

00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:16,480
time to learn about the experiences of

00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,060
people who are different from you look

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,090
for books podcasts blog posts from a

00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:23,710
variety of perspectives the uploaded

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,420
slides from this presentation include

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:28,810
links to some suggested resources you

00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,470
can check out as a starting point and I

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:34,420
was reading a threat on Twitter lately

00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:37,000
about how to be less of a quote clueless

00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:39,820
white person without asking people of

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,370
color to do the work for you and the

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,630
suggestion was go right now on social

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,990
media you're all on your phones right

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:50,030
now anyway follow 50 people of color on

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:54,300
social media and just listen

00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:56,730
don't comment don't retweet just listen

00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:01,080
and you can do this with any identity

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:04,670
that's different from your own so that's

00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,670
it we've solved the problem right

00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:09,510

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,400

organization and yourself be more

inclusive I hope you took away something

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:19,350
that you found helpful and remember that

00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,930
