	DevOpsDays Philadelphia 2019 - Ignites - Zero to DevOps in less than a year... by Rachel Sweeney

With zero years of IT experience and a degree in Chinese History I was offered 4⁄5 jobs when I interviewed for DevOps roles. I often encounter people in IT that struggle to find a path to practicing DevOps. How do we encourage more people to enter this space? My path can provide insights.

When 2019 began I had zero years of IT experience, a degree in Chinese History, and a job working as an Executive Assistant at a Physics Organization. In May I was hired as an Assistant DevOps Engineer at the Pew Research Center where I have the amazing privilege to work with a team that develops machine learning algorithms and study subjects that range from analyzing what Americans hear when they attend church to tracking twitter bots to determine bias in the content that is shared. In the past year I’ve heard numerous sources telling people that they had to be in IT for years before they should think of practicing DevOps. I often hear people ask, “How do I start practicing Devops?” or “Do you think I can get a job in DevOps as a developer/sysadmin/network engineer/etc?” Join me as I briefly share my path to DevOps, how I found the mentors that helped get me here, and how we can do the same for others.

00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:19,419
hey everybody my name is Rachel Sweeney

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,640
and I just recently broke into the area

00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:23,259
of DevOps without any experience and

00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,810
without any degree in anything IT

00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:28,059
related I now work at the Pew Research

00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,040
Center and the team that I work on uses

00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:32,439
computational social science to study

00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,719
issues and one of our projects we are

00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,280
tracking global legislators in five

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,680
different english-speaking countries to

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,450
see how they respond to various state

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,070
events whether its global or whatever

00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,110
just to see how we can study this and

00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,650
see what people are saying almost

00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,390
everything that we do is entirely in

00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,420
Amazon we're using transcribes we can do

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,250
NLP processing on text we're using

00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,739
Python with Berto three the data

00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:58,750
scientists use are in Python but all of

00:00:56,739 --> 00:01:01,000
these are skills that I was not entirely

00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,670
expected to know on day one but at least

00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,259
pick up very quickly currently we are

00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:06,850
working on growing computational social

00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:08,860
science and what we're doing is we're

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:11,320
creating a centralized pipeline to

00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,549
gather data so that regardless of

00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,770
somebody's technical ability at the

00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:16,690
organization they can get the same data

00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:19,330
for analysis that we are using as well

00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,930
so six months ago I was an executive

00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:22,420
assistant

00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,310
I managed calendars I booked flights I

00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,290
did a few other things and when I was in

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,880
college I decided that Chinese history

00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:31,060
was gonna be the lucrative path forward

00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,290
for me didn't work out so well so here I

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,479
am today

00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,310
despite all of this when I was going for

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,320
job interviews I was offered four out of

00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,600
five of the DevOps jobs that I applied

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,250
for it certainly wasn't easy getting

00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,320
through HR was very challenging with

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,119
that background but going to meetups

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,880
networking was a way that really helped

00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,260
me get into it and so initially I

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,610
thought I wanted to be a Linux system

00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,979
administrator when I wanted to make this

00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,900
change and I started studying for the

00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,759
Red Hat certified system administrators

00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,380
and the Red Hat certified engineer exam

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,000
I immediately met some people in a

00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,409
discord group who said you know this is

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,150
a path you can take to get your foot in

00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:05,680
the door and I spent some time doing

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,900
that and that worked out pretty well and

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,519
every time I got stuck with a problem I

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,370
just kept bumping into people who were

00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:13,840
very happy and excited to help they you

00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,280
know time after time they just answered

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,390
any question that I threw at them and

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,819
there was a great exchanging of

00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:20,530
information there eventually needed to

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,810
learn a lot more about networking and

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,640
again I met a mentor who just answered

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,910
so many questions I think this person

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,710
was

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:28,750
the University of Missoula and Montana

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,610
never met them and they've probably

00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:33,120
answered a thousand questions just any

00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:35,110
time I needed any any help with anything

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,300
eventually some people recommended

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,310
ansible chef puppet the beauty of these

00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,930
are that they are open source so for

00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,940
somebody like me who's not working in

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,220
the field it was very easy to download

00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:47,140
them start playing around I got my AWS

00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,480
free tier account plugged everything in

00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,940
together as best as I could quickly

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,920
found docker kubernetes CSC D pipelines

00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,810
just tried to figure out how many things

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,820
I could piece together so it automate

00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:59,770
every step of the flow this was all done

00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,150
on my home machine and the AWS free tier

00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,000
account just seeing how much I could get

00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:05,620
going started picking up projects in

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,300
Python I got a number of different books

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,920
I hadn't done much coding so it was

00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:11,800
pretty much all new to me

00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:13,060
created a django web server you know I'm

00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,650
still doing projects to this day I

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,510
didn't know much the stuff that we're

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:18,640
doing at my current job and now I'm

00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,200
working with machine learning I started

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,090
listening to podcasts like the amazing

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,470
wrested DevOps and half of the things

00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,820
that I was hearing I didn't actually

00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,440
understand what they were but just

00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,060
getting my head into this lingo and

00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,230
understanding how people speak about

00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,360
things was really helpful

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,270
Linux Academy was an amazing resource

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,920
and I realized when you know starting to

00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,990
prepare for this talk the key thread

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,070
throughout all of this was the mentors

00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:41,170
that I met along the way

00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:43,360
these are the people that helped me get

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:44,890
to where I am today and I would not

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,050
behave I've been able to get this far

00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,090
without them and the good news is that

00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,920
you know mentorship is really just an

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,510
exchanging of information it doesn't

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,880
have to be hierarchical it's just

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,950
somebody who is a knowledge expert in an

00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,410
area who can answer questions anytime

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:00,940
they come up and the great thing about

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:02,920
this you know taking that hierarchical

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,250
stakes out of it is that everyone can be

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,500
a mentor everyone here has some skill

00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,790
and knowledge that is better or they

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,590
know more than the person that they're

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:14,290
sitting next to and so whenever

00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,640
questions come up it's on us to answer

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,520
that so we can bring more people into

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,049
this community and so oftentimes you'll

00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,970
see this and like slack channels

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,620
especially community ones or discord

00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,970
somebody will just be saying hey I'm

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,110
stuck on this I don't know what to do

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,420
it's not something they work with

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,250
regularly and we as the experts in that

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,990
area can help answer them and that's how

00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,940
all of my mentorship started was just

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:35,680
ant you know asking these questions a

00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,380
lot of times at meetup still hear people

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,060
say things like we're thinking

00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,070
implementing a CSC D pipeline but we're

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,840
not quite sure what tool to use that's

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:44,280
an area that you work in you can share

00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,100
that information and that's a lot of

00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,020
mentorship start as well and what's

00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,030
obvious to us isn't always to others

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,770
certainly from me starting out I didn't

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,810
know that I could just go to stack stack

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,520
exchange you're gonna meet ups and all

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,380
of these tools are things that we can

00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,910
share and if somebody's new to an area

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,190
just being like these are the resources

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,740
I use here's how I find help for these

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:06,630
issues the last thing I want to mention

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:09,000
is that as people enter the fringe of

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,190
the DevOps community we have the ability

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,740
to empower them to bring them in so

00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:15,210
anytime anybody asks a question try and

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,910
answer it because we here are the

00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:18,970
experts whether we believe it or not

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:21,200
thank you

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:34,499
[Applause]

00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:34,499
