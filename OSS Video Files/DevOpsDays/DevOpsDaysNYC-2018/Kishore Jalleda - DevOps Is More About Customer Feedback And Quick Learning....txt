Description: 
	Kishore Jalleda - DevOps Is More About Customer Feedback And Quick Learning Than Culture, Process And Tools

Are you really “DevOps”? You have spent years going through an amazing transformation. You claim that you are now officially “DevOps”. But, what now? Your customers don’t really care if you are a DevOps shop/factory; they care about how your products –built from that shop/factory– add value to their lives. Common sense stuff, right? Well, unfortunately, no. You’d be surprised as to how many people still quite don’t get what the true spirit of DevOps is. You often hear things like: “We are a team of developers doing operations - we are DevOps!”, or “We are a Dev team continually deploying to production - we are DevOps!”.

While all the above are not false claims, they fail to draw a complete picture of what DevOps is truly about.The first thing that comes to my mind when I hear them is, “Well, all this is great, but now what? Who are you doing all this for? All these changes to your culture, process, and tools for whom? Where do your customers fit into all this? How are all these changes impacting your customers? Most importantly, what are you learning about your customers?”

Come find out more as I explain why and how “DevOps” is more about customer feedback and quick learning than just culture/process/tools. I will focus on four major “DevOps” patterns (from a customer’s perspective); I will throw in some anti-patterns as well while I am at it. These are insights I have gathered over more than a decade of operating some of the top internet sites and games in the world.

[Music]

00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:21,900
in case you did not already notice or

00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,850
did not read about me I worked at Yahoo

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,070
up until very recently was the head of

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,730
Production Engineering running a bunch

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,230
of teams like Yahoo Finance in sports

00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:34,620
prior to that I was the head of s area

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,110
Zynga prior to that I worked at MU I am

00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,920
bu for a long time mu as you know is one

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:43,350
of the pioneers of C D and Eric Ries you

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:47,190
know lead start off so that's the beef

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,960
intro the reason and here is because

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,539
there was an article I published on

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,190
LinkedIn a few months ago and it

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,320
actually got a lot of good feedback and

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,020
I was like maybe I should start talking

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,550
about it more just because of the fact

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,289
that there's a bunch of souls out there

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:03,680
who actually took time to click on it

00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:08,880
and give me some pretty amazing feedback

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,200
which is right here and roughly the

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,909
agenda is going to look like you know

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,170
I'll do a brief intro for a few minutes

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,890
and then I'll talk about some of the

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,400
patterns of about and then specifically

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,619
about uptime velocity and then you know

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,750
the industry trends and developed itself

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:31,680
and some of the anti-patterns intact

00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:33,840
okay I think you know on the intro part

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,970
I think it's it's important to sort of

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,890
you know do it quickly refresher on why

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,240
DevOps is important you know empathy I

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,640
know the previous speaker and already

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,600
talked about it it's not a buzzword it's

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,490
important

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,170
mindfulness is very important you know

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:50,610
it's it's it's a topic I'll be touching

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:52,560
upon a lot in this talk it also makes

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,630
your well-known an engineer teaches you

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,750
soft skills I'll touch more upon this

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,340
towards the very end where I talk about

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,810
the creating the right kind of

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,810
interdependence between Devon ops

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:09,209
mindfulness I think it's important very

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:12,120
important mainly because most of us are

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:14,549
sort of trained to act a certain way

00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,260
I'm kidding myself we so are like

00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:18,720
focused on on the day-to-day stuff that

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,379
sometimes we forget what is important

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,170
what is the big thing

00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,120
or it is a big picture so my arm so

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:25,530
that's like you know mindlessness so

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,019
mindfulness is more about like being

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:30,120
present and asking the question like why

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:32,010
is something important how does that fit

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,659
into the big picture questioning

00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:35,879
assumptions and things like that I think

00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:37,260
that's it's going to be a repetitive

00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,420
thing I'll be talking about in this

00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,060
topic okay

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,310
are you really DevOps right I've done

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,470
this for a long time and you know ops

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,989
for a long time and I hear a lot of

00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:51,000
things actually surprised even when some

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:52,890
pretty senior people and ask them what

00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,379
what they mean by DevOps I mean they're

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:58,109
like I get all kinds of response all

00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,709
these are not necessarily like false but

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:03,840
I think what they don't give us is you

00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:05,700
know they they fail to draw a complete

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,690
picture of what truly DevOps is about

00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,739
but you know about all this I'm like you

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,549
know you've gone through this amazing

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,769
transformation

00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:15,840
you're spent you know a lots of years

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,459
you know you're doing things like CD but

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,720
who are you really doing this far where

00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:19,880
do your grading whether your customers

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,209
fit into all this

00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,829
most often than not people fail to

00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:29,220
address that question I think most

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:32,220
importantly the real question we should

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,500
be asking is where does your customers

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,299
fit into all this like what is how are

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,829
they benefiting from all the changes to

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:43,280
your making to your tools and process

00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:48,140
and culture am I

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:55,330
oh I thought so and I forgot to turn

00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:55,330
this on sorry were you guys able to hear

00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:06,459
sure is that better are you did you even

00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:10,400
hear me up under there okay okay

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:12,770
cool awesome

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,890
so with that intro let's get into the

00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:19,850
patterns first one customer I really

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,250
don't care about five brands

00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:24,890
availability I think after doing this

00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,630
for a long time what I've noticed they

00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,250
really cared about five 9s customer

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,050
service if there's something like that

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,970
we'll talk more about that but the

00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,720
reason I say that is you know things

00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,850
like your iPhone then laptops Wi-Fi like

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,030
the devices you're actually using to

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:43,610
access a service or a product our

00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,800
pencils not very you know like they're

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:48,410
not five nines really reliable so

00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,080
there's no point in most cases of making

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,630
your service five minutes reliable just

00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,310
because customers don't expect that you

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,190
know we almost sort of have learned to

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,850
live with the fact that things don't

00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,510
work all the time

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:08,870
okay this is Brad look familiar

00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,120
I've run you know ops for users from you

00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:12,919
know a few million users you know at

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,590
Yahoo we had over a billion users and

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,470
each end is an outage and your graph

00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,120
looks like that for RPS it almost almost

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,640
inevitably comes back

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,780
just showing you that your customers

00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:26,540
still have your product they're not

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:31,540
going to abandon you for being down the

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:33,950
point I'm trying to make is understand

00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:36,979
what is the right level of uptime that

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,600
you need for your product and for you to

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,570
be able to understand that question I

00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:43,190
think it's important to understand the

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:46,760
user behavior the customer behavior

00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:48,440
gather some data and exactly see like

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,840
what is it that they care about right so

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,360
it's important to establish that and

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:58,880
once you've established back a great

00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,820
approach to to holding people

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,650
accountable and and and and you know

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,729
holding each know if you're a deaf team

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,050
in ops you mean holding each other

00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:08,060
accountable is to establish budgets

00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,830
right so once you have an external

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,800
target you may also have an internal

00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:14,419
target and once you can establish those

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,210
contracts between the dev teams and the

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:19,400
Ops teams it makes a I'll actually give

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:20,750
an example on this and on the next slide

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,790
but the formula is simple that you're

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,750
under the budget ship ship ship if

00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:29,389
you're over and slow down and an example

00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,300
was by never the zynga I'll come to the

00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:34,400
facts of this but we had too many alerts

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,850
going on about $200,000 it's going to

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,710
you know fifty person SAE team and then

00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:43,130
one day I had this brilliant idea where

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,150
I said let's sit down we actually said

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:46,220
to sat down with each of the game

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:48,620
studios and established contracts

00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,410
actually error budgets and said if you

00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:53,800
go over a certain limit I will deny us

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:57,350
re coverage like Nomura sorry coverage

00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,000
you can like do your own thing you can

00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,220
go hire your own you can go hide and

00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,200
hire your own s or anything but I am NOT

00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:05,360
going to give you support so what that

00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,729
did was it created the right incentives

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,889
it also aligned the incentives so that

00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:11,660
the dev teams had the right incentives

00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:13,789
to keep the other two all you know as a

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,860
reteam had also the right incentives to

00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:18,380
provide that you know a good level of

00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:20,750
support of the tech things so these

00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,370
things actually work in real life

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:25,190
but it's important to actually sit down

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:31,610
and and and talk about then and you know

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:33,470
establish those contracts okay and

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,599
before you obsess over uptime I think

00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:39,620
the reality these days is you get a few

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,060
or nines out of the box it's you don't

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,710
have to work really hard and every now

00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:45,130
and after that as we know is is is

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:48,919
probably going to be expensive

00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,389
so don't again it's it's about

00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:52,490
establishing the right amount of uptime

00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:56,180
and understanding the customer behavior

00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,820
before you try to over engineer

00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:01,009
you know your your application for for

00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,199
reliability the other thing is uptime is

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:05,810
everyone's responsibility episode I've

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,030
actually spoken with product folks who

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,889
said when you go and have them menus you

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,000
know being an ox person day and when you

00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:13,340
ask them what do they care about they

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,320
say the site has to be up all the time

00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:16,970
and I'm saying what does that mean up

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,800
all the time can you give me a number so

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:22,220
ask them those questions I try to

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,690
commodify that I just don't date you

00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:26,240
know just because I'm on the part of the

00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,789
products and you know the service has to

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:34,130
be up all the time it doesn't mean that

00:08:27,789 --> 00:08:36,229
just you know ask for a number okay you

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,789
know I talked a lot about uptime but

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,529
there are going to be scenarios where

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:42,110
uptime is going to be critical right

00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:44,270
in fact what are the comments I got on

00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,250
my on LinkedIn was somebody said it's

00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,510
you know TurboTax it's April 14th and

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,029
obviously you would want your site to be

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:53,330
out the same thing with you know when we

00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:54,589
have like live events NFL night National

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,250
Signing Day or you know Berkshire

00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:00,020
Hathaway's first-ever you have to those

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:02,390
are pretty tactical stuff so if you

00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:04,790
prepare for them you can actually make

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:06,290
sure that your site is up so I'm not

00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:08,660
suggesting that you should you should go

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,370
down during that point of time but that

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:12,680
stuff you should be able to figure out

00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:16,070
with enough planning in fact I actually

00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,170
you know during 2017 season when he SPN

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,520
was down Yahoo was up so we're pretty

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,490
proud about that there was like 200

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:26,230
people in a war room for their birthday

00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,160
for the whole day anyway so that's

00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:32,420
pattern one

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:37,339
I don't talked a lot about uptime the

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,779
second pattern is about velocity I mean

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,430
I come from I mean my background is at

00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:42,680
in view and we routinely shipped 50

00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:45,980
times today this was back in 2007-2008

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,540
timeframe I be talkin at Yahoo we talk a

00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,820
lot about at least you talk a lot about

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,399
you know we we've spent all these years

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,570
you know going through CD no humans and

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,970
loved everything goes to production

00:09:53,570 --> 00:10:00,470
automatically but I think what we fail

00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:02,990
to do a good job at is what happens

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:04,640
after you should right you you spent all

00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:07,019
this time your shipping multiple times a

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,269
day but what are you learning

00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:12,029
in terms of your customers after your

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,880
ship something so in my experience I

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:16,649
think engineers tend to sort of

00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,980
overlooked part of this so I'll be

00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:21,720
talking about that here so again your

00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,899
job is not that if you just ship you

00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,130
have to follow up you have to own your

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,899
you know your your commit you have to

00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,370
own your push you have to follow up and

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:32,610
make sure that you're you know learning

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:34,529
about your customers again garbage in is

00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:38,100
our garbage yard up in these days you

00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:40,769
know fast CD pipelines elastic serving

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:42,959
stats it's not hard to to get them in

00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:44,550
again if you send in garbage garbage is

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,769
going to come out can as I mentioned the

00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,500
problem is most of us is based on my

00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:50,910
experience is known as focused on

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:57,420
happens what you know and what happens

00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:59,640
after a ship have a simple sort of a you

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,260
know so you can call it the plan but you

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:03,089
can call it strategy or tactics or

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,950
whatever you want to call it but this is

00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:07,230
you can if you try to do this as an

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:08,880
engineer every time your ship are before

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,100
your ship if you ask yourself you know

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,600
why am I doing this why am i doing what

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,640
I'm doing

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,519
how does what I'm doing now fit into the

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,800
big picture right how does this what a

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,560
success look like like why am i doing it

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:24,149
now and not later right if you can do

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,279
this simple exercise don't spend a lot

00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:27,959
of time addition you're doing something

00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:30,630
it sort of teaches you to be mindful

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,440
about not doing things just for the sake

00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,940
of doing things right and after you ship

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,300
again ask this question what have you

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,140
learned

00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,699
show me the metrics has anything moved

00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:43,980
you know you plan something that you had

00:11:41,699 --> 00:11:45,959
a success criteria so as that success

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,180
criteria been met after you ship

00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,860
something if you're not like why was it

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,320
not met or do I have have a not

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,500
instrumented my application properly ask

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,850
those questions and then the most

00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,130
important question you should you should

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,750
be asking is what else can I be doing to

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:03,660
make things to make things better faster

00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:05,699
you know bigger and that sort of becomes

00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,500
your micro strategy and then you iterate

00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:09,779
on that and then go back and make things

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,300
better in fact when I was it was a dim

00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:12,899
view just to give an example our revenue

00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:16,819
increased

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:19,590
10x over a period of one year just by

00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:21,420
making it easier for people

00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:23,520
use our pot everything stayed the same

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,680
but it was if it's just like people were

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,210
coming into the funnel millions of

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,610
people but then they were finding it

00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:30,990
extremely hard or challenging to use the

00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,530
product and actually understand what the

00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:36,420
product is and the value and provided

00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,710
but making it easy and this didn't

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,150
happen overlaid it was a bunch of

00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:41,100
iterations a bunch of experiments and

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:49,020
actually learning about the customer

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:50,880
behavior okay and then I actually like

00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,260
this example a lot I've seen people how

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,210
many times do you know let me just ask

00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,040
you a questions how many of you just

00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:58,110
commit something to production just walk

00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:05,130
away or just go to lunch or just go home

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:08,460
right that's terrible right it's really

00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:10,380
bad doing that um if you as a let's say

00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,530
you're doing CD deploying multiple times

00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,300
a day if you as an engineer don't care

00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:17,220
about learning you know how the

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,110
customers are actually using something

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,240
that you ship it doesn't matter if your

00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,820
commute goes to production today or

00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:27,960
tomorrow or a month later space so you

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:30,450
should be very particular and should be

00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,250
really concerned and curious about the

00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,130
stuff that you start you push the

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:36,870
production okay

00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,420
and then are you engaging with the

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:41,580
customers with several different ways

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:45,200
but hoping and I'm hoping you're using a

00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:47,460
combination of all these and maybe more

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:49,620
again it's important to develop a true

00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,350
empathy just to give an example there

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,030
was a CEO of this company called

00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,350
machines owned I was interviewing with

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:57,270
them like a long time ago and is this

00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:00,660
his name is Gabe he gave me an example

00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:02,130
where he said if you really wanted to

00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:03,750
develop true empathy toward your

00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,070
customers actually lived like a customer

00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,000
if you're so if your target customer is

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,490
making out at home

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,500
I'd say $20,000 in the earth he said

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:12,810
live like as person who was making

00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,360
$30,000 in the earth using your product

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,130
for a couple of weeks actually live like

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,270
that person and then see what happens I

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:24,550
thought that was a brilliant suggestion

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:29,870
right pretty hardcore okay

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:31,880
let's see parenting I think people have

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:35,290
sort of been talking about this but if

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:37,400
you look at how the industry is evolving

00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:39,710
and how some of the tools like

00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:43,220
kubernetes and you know things like

00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:45,050
micro services and envoy sto and

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,690
although the observability and all the

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:52,460
good stuff and and and and the buzzwords

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,110
out there what is happening is sort of i

00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,450
call it like the democratization of

00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:58,910
distributed system that's it's easy to

00:14:56,450 --> 00:15:01,850
scale systems it's easy to you know get

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,990
a few nines out of the box but with all

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:04,960
this complexity in all these

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,430
abstractions what's happening is

00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,200
inherently like running a complex system

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,150
is becoming harder and harder so i think

00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,570
where the industry sort of moving

00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:17,300
towards is the operations people are

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,820
focusing on the infrastructure platforms

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:22,100
you know observability and the

00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:24,980
engineering teams are are the dev teams

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,110
are focusing on how can i use those

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:29,900
tools how can i use those platforms to

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,880
enable you know Denzil to do their jobs

00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,680
better do you know to make amazing

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,110
products for their customers I also

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,000
think that just business logic is no

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,350
longer a strategic differentiator these

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,270
days I think it's important you know

00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:43,340
especially given the the ships at the

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:45,920
infrastructure space is undergoing

00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:49,040
thanks to people like you know Google I

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,840
think it's it's I'm noticing this and

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,690
it's important to keep this in mind if

00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:56,090
you are one of those teams where you are

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,040
not providing the right value to your

00:15:56,090 --> 00:16:03,860
engineering teams it's probably time to

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,320
question that okay let's see examples um

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,120
several different examples I think

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,040
probably one of my favorites is when we

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,880
shipped at Yahoo in 2015 we shipped a

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,530
product called daily fantasy so the

00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,050
production in unity which is my team was

00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:20,630
very was helped the engineering teams to

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:22,490
ship the product helping them with DNS

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,630
and you know infrastructure and you know

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,990
platforms and things like that

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:31,100
monitoring but mostly hands-off after

00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:33,820
that there's also a team at Yahoo called

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,690
screwdriver which builds these amazing

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,900
CD pipelines for the whole

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:41,390
right so that's a beauty beautiful model

00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:43,820
in the sense that the Ops teams have are

00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:46,370
going from traditionally doing things

00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,080
like a sari and you know and being

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,910
embedded with the engineering teams and

00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,040
helping them with monitoring and you

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,770
know capacity and post-mortems to more

00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,540
like building tools and platforms like

00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,070
screwdriver like kubernetes actually

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,920
kubernetes is also a great example where

00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:05,360
right now about 200,000 RP s worth of

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:08,180
you know app server are PS are running

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,310
on kubernetes at yahoo including Yahoo

00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,920
Finance in Yahoo Sports and there's a

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:15,500
the production engineering team actually

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,790
helped do that which was a dramatic

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,339
shift from what they were doing earlier

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:20,780
so they were more I would say in terms

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:22,250
of the industry they're more similar to

00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,420
a sari but now they're big slowly

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,949
becoming you know that sort of the

00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:27,350
infrastructure teams then happen

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:27,740
overnight but I see this happening more

00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,630
and more

00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,860
even at larger companies in fact if

00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,140
you're if you're in a smaller company

00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:36,200
you probably wouldn't even hired like an

00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:39,080
ops person until your CDs see your CDs D

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:44,930
right probably doesn't make sense to do

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:47,240
that cool and then as a profession I

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:48,680
think I talked about this it's very much

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,580
alive but I think it's really up to us

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:54,680
to define our destiny which is what we

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,260
did at Yahoo you know when we bake the

00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,820
kubernetes platform we said you know

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,200
this is our destiny this is what this is

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,300
how we will be adding value to the

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:07,880
company again the screwdriver team is

00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:09,680
another great example okay okay like

00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,210
talked about scaling and don't if you're

00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,030
like you know putting about scaling it's

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,950
not hard to do for most come I mean

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:18,860
until it until you are you're maybe I

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:20,480
don't know some large company and it's

00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,030
easy to do it these days so don't obsess

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,310
over it just like uptime you know you

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,330
can get away with a lot of you know

00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,090
brute force

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:34,940
you know solutions at that point to a

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:36,110
certain point okay I talked about the

00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,490
right kind of interdependent

00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:40,820
interdependence between ops and then

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,960
during mine one of the earliest life but

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,660
I think that the example I like to give

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,670
is as a manager one of my sort of

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:50,280
strategy or tactic is to tailor

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:52,200
you know my strategy towards each in

00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,780
each individual you know person because

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,690
everyone have their own strengths right

00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:58,800
similarly when you come to when you have

00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,360
the right kind of interdependence

00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,010
between ops and their what's going to

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,750
happen is it it creates that

00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:05,790
interdependence for example if I know if

00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,170
I'm a dev team I'll go to the ops team

00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:08,640
you know in this case for example at

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,010
Yahoo it is the kubernetes team right

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,630
it's no longer the ops team it's the

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,420
infrastructure team I think that creates

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:17,760
that I kind of interdependence people

00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,290
are also once people are you know have

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,180
ownership of a product on a platform

00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,910
there that they are more willing to be

00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,260
held held accountable and there's

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,700
nothing better than that

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,770
because you know that automatically

00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,060
creates right motivation it also

00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,130
introduces a healthy degree of

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,280
disruption because people are you know

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:38,480
people feel the ownership again the

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,570
daily fantasy Yahoo was a great example

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,280
okay pattern um before I can get off

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,940
this table stakes and you know people

00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:49,260
even if you take the example of CD

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:52,230
companies have been doing CD for a long

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:54,570
time like for over I don't know over a

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,080
decade oh you're twelve years or so mu

00:19:54,570 --> 00:20:00,870
Flickr you know at least the publicly

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,510
known companies right so the strategic

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:09,000
differentiator in my opinion is going to

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:10,530
be like how obsessed you are with your

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,810
customers right I think that's going to

00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:14,010
be the strategic differentiator you have

00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,240
to have DevOps animated DevOps

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:16,530
conference I'm saying about sustainable

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,330
stakes that's not a bad thing it's it's

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,850
you know trying to you know get there

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:22,710
but actually got this from HBR where

00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:25,740
they were doing something they did some

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,110
extensive study about a company and they

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,320
talked about how responding to customers

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,790
fast actually gives you a hell of an

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,060
advantage in fact people who are willing

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:37,530
to pay like Anna Forex more amount for

00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:39,150
airline tickets you know where the

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:41,760
number of complaints are very high as we

00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:43,890
all know but if you have time go check

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,200
it out it talks about why customer

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:47,250
service is so important again your

00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,770
customers could be your internal

00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,780
customers external customers are it's

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,850
important to engage with them listen to

00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:55,000
them and trust me when you don't listen

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:59,290
to your customers I've actually

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,750
seem there you know the consequences of

00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:06,160
that and it's not fun to be in that spot

00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,140
I'm talking about P dos attacks and

00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:12,820
security breaches and people target you

00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:14,770
and it's it's a nightmare almost there

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,720
anti-patterns and this is not much

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,870
actually there's I mean there's what I

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,580
mean by that is really it comes down to

00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:24,400
when I said you know anti patterns or

00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:29,110
anti parents anything that distance is a

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,580
customer from their user or a software

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:32,770
engineer from the customer is an anti

00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:35,830
visa is an anti pattern right so any

00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,420
layers of bureaucracy any teams that you

00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,310
insert in between might give some

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:42,280
examples but if you hear things like

00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:43,930
that where we say oh I don't want to be

00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,970
responding to alerts and so let me add

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:48,460
like three layers in between so that you

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:52,480
know my devs don't get woken up at 3:00

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:55,270
again it's like right so so

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,660
that's so that's that right to actually

00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:01,960
give you an example this is how things

00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,670
look like at Yahoo prior to me joining

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,850
the company and I said that doesn't make

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:10,300
sense at all that's like why are there

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,220
so many layers and it just people

00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:15,220
suffered I mean there were times where

00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:16,570
if you are using Yahoo Finance I mean

00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,370
there were times where there was a p1

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:21,280
outage that went unnoticed for you know

00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:23,530
14 hours and then out of that TTD was 13

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,030
hours and 15 minutes mainly because the

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:26,830
alert you know have been sitting with

00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:31,300
teams who are sitting in I don't know

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:33,190
some other state it's not fun at all it

00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,580
was a really hard thing to do like

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:38,230
getting this change implemented it's

00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:42,520
more political as you can imagine then

00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:43,990
technical but we got it done but yeah if

00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,390
you see things like this where there's

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,030
unnecessary layers in between questions

00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:51,250
that shift right and then the results

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:54,130
will look like that there's a dramatic

00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,260
drop in TDD just because you know the

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,360
devs were getting paged now directly and

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,010
then they were being woken up which

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,980
means it there started writing better

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:05,000
software and things like that so that's

00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:12,939
it thank you and good luck

00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:12,939
