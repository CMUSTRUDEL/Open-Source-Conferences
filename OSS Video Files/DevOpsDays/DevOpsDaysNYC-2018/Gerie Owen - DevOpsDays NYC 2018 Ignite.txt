00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:21,090
I'm Jerry oh man

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:25,199
I'm a test manager Potter is a tester I

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:31,260
work for quality group and I'm really

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:33,390
happy to be here I like to tell you a

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,360
little bit about DevOps and groupthink

00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:37,950
is it an oxymoron well what does

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,840
groupthink it's a phenomenon where

00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:43,290
people tend to conform to the group

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,539
rather than feeling up castanet that

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,180
can't lead to errors and decision-making

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,829
sometimes large ones there are a bunch

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,760
of characteristics that you'll see in

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,079
groupthink

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,320
you'll see an illusion of

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,109
invulnerability where the team has

00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,750
excessive optimism and it encourages

00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:03,989
excessive risk you'll see you'll see a

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,090
collective rationalization you'll see

00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,770
the inherent belief and morality where

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,600
but we're a team thinks that what

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,110
they're doing is just so right that it

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:17,250
can't possibly be wrong podcasts I guess

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:20,490
testers get stereotyped and our opinions

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,340
aren't necessarily counted direct

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,979
pressure on dissenters sometimes the the

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,290
team will will actually be forced to

00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,159
conform which means that of course we

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,939
sell Center self-censor and all of that

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,860
can lead to an illusion of unanimity

00:01:34,939 --> 00:01:39,840
which means that you know the team a

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:43,649
think their decision is unanimous that

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,439
it really may not be well is this a

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,009
problem is it a problem for DevOps

00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,320
well it can be its

00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:54,720
ups is a culture of collaboration we

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,689
have multiple different expertise in the

00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,329
same team which is good but we all have

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,370
our mindsets and our biases and

00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:07,580
sometimes those can cause errors and

00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:10,070
making and failures and deliberation so

00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:12,260
why does this happen well there's the

00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,570
illusion of responsible in Boehner

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,870
ability a team could be a consistent

00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:21,380
agreement little discussion and then the

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:23,750
collective rationalization this happens

00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,370
because of information signals some of

00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,730
those characteristics we discussed

00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:32,090
social pressures of course the influence

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:35,030
of strong leaders so let's talk a little

00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,680
bit about why this happens a lot of

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:40,400
times group members can have fixed

00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:43,430
mindsets and then group interaction will

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,800
amplify individual bias as Peter talked

00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:50,000
some about biases earlier and how they

00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,240
can work and those coupled work to find

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,690
deliberation failures no license was a

00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:58,990
theory by Carol Dweck it talks about

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:01,880
people that have fixed mindsets versus

00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:03,470
growth it's based on how we see the

00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,110
world and how we respond to life's

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,580
challenges a fixed mindset believes that

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,920
their intelligence is the intelligence

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,540
their one myth and they're going to

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,470
constantly keep trying to prove

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:17,560
themselves so you know well I I my job

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,230
right it's somebody else's mistake

00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,970
whereas a growth mindset person feels

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,459
that their intelligence is a starting

00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,680
point they see they see a failure as an

00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:30,020
opportunity to learn they're into

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,060
continuous development

00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,880
if your team happens to have more fixed

00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:37,100
mindsets you're gonna have groupthink

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:39,320
now in the bias category well you know

00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,040
Peter explained what a bias is we have

00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,140
certain beliefs and they can cloud our

00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,480
ability to think critically and when we

00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,370
as a group don't think critically and

00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,500
you have great thing now there are two

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,500
biases that are particularly concerning

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,860
and groupthink and that's represented

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,590
this where people judge based on similar

00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,140
situations and also the confirmation

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,660
bias and weigh heavily more evidence

00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:06,760
that supports their view now this all

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:09,100
leads to failures and deliberation so

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,160
we've got a strong leader here our self

00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:14,320
censoring bear there in our stereotyped

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,940
dumb caste let's talk a little bit about

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,890
the Cascade effect

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,980
you know what I love about the Cascade

00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:24,390
effect you think about planning poker

00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:28,720
about five about five if I bought a

00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:31,630
yeah so yes each person says something

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
the next person is gonna tend to agree

00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,660
they're gonna think I will maybe if she

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,240
you know something I don't

00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,980
that was polarization you know we may

00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,680
start out with moderate but opposing

00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,780
views but the more we talk especially

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,310
the fixed mindset in folks the more they

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,290
dig into by the time you get through

00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,140
you've got people on two ends of the

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:53,500
spectrum know what medicate this in

00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,680
DevOps well because it inhibits the

00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,640
principles of transparency and

00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,490
communication

00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:03,310
it impedes DevOps transformations but

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:06,490
most importantly our whole premise of

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:10,200
DevOps that innovation we lose that we

00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:18,299
lose a lot of that innovation thank you

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:18,299
