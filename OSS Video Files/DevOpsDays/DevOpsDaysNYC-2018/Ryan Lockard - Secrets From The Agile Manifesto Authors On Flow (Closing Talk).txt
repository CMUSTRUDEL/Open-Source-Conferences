Title: Ryan Lockard - Secrets From The Agile Manifesto Authors On Flow (Closing Talk)
Publication date: 2018-02-01
Playlist: DevOpsDaysNYC-2018
Description: 
	I interviewed 14 of the 17 Agile Manifesto authors for a special podcast project with the intent to chronicle the manifesto story. What emerged was much more. The story of why the event was needed, what the vision was, how this was ruined in industry. Learn how DevOps is the true agility enabler.

[Music]

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:19,740
I do apologize to start coming off of a

00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,670
cold so I'm a little more annoying

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,439
sounding than I'd normally sound but

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,859
what I want to do is kind of step

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,320
through bit of a story that kind of

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,760
evolved from a larger project that I was

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,680
a was privileged to take part of and

00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,870
we're gonna talk through it today here's

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,340
the thing I like informal conversations

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,950
their slides up here there's a

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,120
stenographer who's gonna really enjoy

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:47,820
everything I have to say I'm sure and

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,170
then um yeah it's a video camera so I'll

00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,710
remember all the bad things I say later

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,420
yeah let's make this interactive you

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,829
know there's there's a few of us left

00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,270
and I do appreciate everyone that's

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,770
stuck around to the end here if you have

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,440
questions if you want to throw

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,609
challenges out go for it really look

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040
forward to a debate and having a healthy

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:09,090
conversation so we'll jump straight into

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,960
it so today we're gonna we're gonna step

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,670
through we're going to talk about the

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,409
agile manifesto authors we're gonna talk

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,380
about a series of interviews that I was

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,729
privileged to conduct with them if

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,500
you're not familiar with the agile

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,110
manifesto we could talk about that very

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,950
quickly john curran who happens to be

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,299
one of the authors he he actually ended

00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,979
I think the interview or the sit-down I

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,259
had with him with with basically saying

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:33,540
for the four measly bullets and all this

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,759
 happens so the the enterprise the

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,229
the industry everything that happened

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,060
around it really just started to shift

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,640
after they codified everything down into

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,200
four bullets and it's there's this over

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,560
that statements if you haven't seen it

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,170
before

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,759
agile manifesto org has basically the

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:49,470
four bullets and then there's a second

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,119
page that hardly anyone ever goes to

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,820
where there's 12 principles that are

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,950
detailed as well but we're gonna go

00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:57,930
through we're gonna kind of talk about

00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,700
the simple four bullets right I'm going

00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,140
to run that into 45 minutes of me

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,189
talking and you guys wanting to get on a

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:06,810
train alright so what are we what are we

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,270
gonna hopefully cover today we're gonna

00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,760
talk about what agile is or at least my

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,739
definition when you um Tom

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,689
great talk yesterday about the same time

00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,579
about the same place and he said you

00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,110
asked 10 different DevOps practitioners

00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:21,599
what DevOps is you get 11 different

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,400
answers he was being conservative I

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,799
posit that you have 25 to 30 different

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,870
definitions same thing happens in agile

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:29,280
right so I'll try to construct the

00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,659
definition of agile that makes sense to

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,180
me what I've experienced and what I feel

00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,530
is really meaningful we'll talk a little

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,970
bit about what the magical manifesto

00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,590
it's just the baseline everyone to make

00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,790
sure that you know this thing that I'm

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:41,310
gonna be talking about everyone kind of

00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,629
has a baseline on what I'm gonna talk

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,040
about extreme programming I'm gonna

00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:45,659
assume that we have a lot of ops folks

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,060
in the room Cistus admins and such

00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:51,030
extreme programming at the very highest

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:53,400
level was it was originally a framework

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,069
that was launched by a bunch of the guys

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,079
that were the agile manifesto authors so

00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,849
when I talk about extreme programming XP

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,290
think about that but what really came

00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,030
out of it and what still stands today is

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,440
a set of practices that are still in

00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,909
place so if you think about like

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,129
refactoring if you hear people talk

00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:09,450
about test-driven development pair

00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,609
programming collective code ownership

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:13,650
those types of things those are the

00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:18,209
practices that still stand today that

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:19,379
were introduced back in the XP days what

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,949
the hell does all this have to do with

00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,230
DevOps

00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:23,370
we'll get there just just ride the wave

00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,859
with me and I promise you we'll get

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:29,819
there and then I'm gonna talk about how

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:31,290
arrogant I could possibly be if you've

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:32,819
seen a couple Contino people around they

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,410
will stand behind the sentence that Ryan

00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,669
is a very arrogant jackass

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:41,879
so we'll get into that too so speaking

00:03:38,669 --> 00:03:45,060
of the arrogance what the way this talk

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:46,980
started was like all good things I was

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:51,949
sitting in a bar with my friends right

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,449
practitioner friends and we were pretty

00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:56,370
frustrated I guess with with where the

00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:57,959
agile community was at that point in

00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,609
time this is about a year and a half two

00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,379
years ago and we're just talking about

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,730
the certification aspect of it we were

00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:04,470
talking about the project management

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,480
aspect of and how we've actually drifted

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,010
from the core technical practices that

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,479
we felt were meant to be there so we

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,620
wanted to have a conversation an honest

00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:14,010
conversation with the agile manifesto

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:16,669
authors to say okay what was it that

00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:19,530
made you guys come together back in 2001

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:21,599
in Snowbird Utah right outside of Salt

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,979
Lake and have that meeting have that

00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,690
have that serious so we wanted to do a

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,130
historical look back because there was

00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,260
enough

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:30,200
that we knew of that existed in the

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,520
public domain that had that conversation

00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,440
so we figured the best way to do that

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,430
was a podcast right here comes the

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,310
arrogant part I had no idea how to do a

00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:41,450
podcast and on top of that I was gonna

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,010
do with a bunch of people that I have a

00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:45,170
high degree of respect for that don't

00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:47,300
even know my name but yeah yeah we're a

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,340
bar we're probably several beers deep

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,380
and well yeah we're gonna do this we

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,000
said an acceptance criteria of we're

00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,620
gonna talk to seven of the seventeen

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,850
that's gonna be our benchmark that's a

00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,140
high-water mark we're gonna thought the

00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:00,950
seven of them if we do that we're

00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:04,280
successful right so we started reaching

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:06,860
out to get their authors in batches of

00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,960
three we sent out the first batch of

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:13,400
requests to come in holy crap all three

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,440
of them came back almost immediately and

00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,690
said yes it's time we need to do this so

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,460
that freaked us out pretty good and we

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,890
then started to scramble and said okay

00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,210
what how do you do a podcast I swear to

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,820
god the very first interview is with

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,020
John Kerry I want you to listen to it I

00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:30,050
don't want you to listen to it at the

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:33,230
same time because I kid you not

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,960
it's my iPhone sitting on top of a beer

00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,940
glass in a crowded bar with us having a

00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,250
conversation like this over no equipment

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,420
nothing fancy and there was a drinking

00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:45,680
theme that's establishing I'm realizing

00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:46,790
an awareness but actually the other

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,380
accent that kind of came out of this was

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,760
and I'm gonna move a little faster here

00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,930
the thing that came out of this was we

00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,820
were trying to do a historic look back

00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:54,080
what we found out is the first station

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,240
that we shared was shared with by these

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,920
guys and they actually kind of unraveled

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,350
why they actually set up the agile

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,300
manifesto and and it kind of resonates

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,780
with the heart of why we're all here

00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,720
today

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,190
we ended up speaking to 1714 the 17 so

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:10,430
that benchmark that we had of seven

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,540
doubled it cool and and they took a

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,860
little while to get through all of these

00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,440
we had to work with some scheduling

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,780
issues only three that we did not yet

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,450
get to talk to would be a Ward

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,800
Cunningham Kent Beck and Dave Thomas

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,080
although this is um available by the way

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,430
the group that kind of came out of that

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,950
conversation in a bar it's called the

00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:29,180
agile uprising there's a whole podcast

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,400
now we actually learned how to do

00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:33,770
podcasting in the middle of all this i

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,270
no longer actually am a member of host

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:36,390
on it I had to step back so I got a

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,160
little too busy

00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:40,350
but all of these interviews are

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,990
available if you really want to find out

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,880
how horrible you speak record yourself

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,320
14 hours talking to people that you

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:50,760
respect then go through and listen to it

00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:54,660
again we'll crank through some some more

00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:55,770
content quickly here the one thing that

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,180
I've kind of found interesting is when

00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:59,460
we were speaking with Alistair he shared

00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,620
this this this thought that they wrote

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:03,600
the manifesto to avoid the codification

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,680
of practices and if you look at the

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,060
industry today there's a lot of

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,490
complication of practices

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,830
it doesn't even like you can look at any

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,390
software shop that most of these DevOps

00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,560
practitioners are supporting and they're

00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,450
probably following some heavyweight

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,120
framework under the banner of some type

00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,550
of agile practice and it's it's

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:26,330
interesting that we're now getting

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:29,460
further away from the original intent so

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:30,780
like every good talk should I say I'm

00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,610
gonna tell you what the secrets are

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:34,080
right and I'm supposed to building to

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,210
their secrets over time these are the

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,390
secrets right here so we can all go home

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,450
now

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:41,100
no it's it's technical practices it's

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:42,180
it's strong teams and it's mindfulness

00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,770
that's actually what we're gonna build

00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,940
into and I'm telling you this is one of

00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,110
the last slides we're gonna see it again

00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,270
but what I'm going to do is actually

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:50,310
explain to you this is where we're

00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,660
landing and should not be a surprise to

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:53,700
anyone that this is how you make

00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,050
meaningful teams this is how you deliver

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,750
the value very quickly and very

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:01,050
sustainably right so let's talk about

00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,940
this a little bit the agile manifesto

00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:05,700
event happened in 2001 like I said in

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,560
Snowbird Utah when it actually kicked

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,760
off wasn't even called agile they

00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,460
literally called it the lightweight of

00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,270
methods conference they held it at a

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,610
resort

00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,530
the resort there the the sessions were

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:19,620
broken into two and a half days the

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,600
first half day was meeting at a bar in

00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,190
the lounge and there were guys were

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,170
getting together and learning from each

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,640
other who they were back in the day they

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:28,320
didn't have the internet and WebEx and

00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,610
all that good stuff is this 2001 stone

00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:34,860
Age's we are we got some pretty good

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:36,450
insights into some of the artifacts that

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,180
were never really out there in the

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:43,800
public before I love this one this is

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,060
Andy Hunt actually for everybody that is

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,230
technical in the room you've probably

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,760
read some books from the pragmatic book

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:52,320
it's that you're familiar with the if

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,580
you saw one cover of them you would know

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,500
exactly what I'm talking about

00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,390
Andy hunts the guy that's actually

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,170
behind the pragmatic bookshelf with his

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,730
partner but if these are if you look at

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,520
it the lower half of this handwriting

00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,550
those are the four agile principles

00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:11,880
that's what manifesto principles I love

00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:14,310
the fact that there was a lot of intent

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,630
in the numbering right so you can see

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,450
that it was reordered at least three

00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:19,770
times the first one never changed well

00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,290
the only changes they took off social

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,640
networks that got because you know

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:28,350
Facebook and then Kent went and worked

00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:29,790
at Facebook and got weird so who did we

00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,380
talk to he's talked to Bob Martin right

00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,600
real quick Bob Martin when the

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,430
grandfathers of XP I was written a whole

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,850
bunch of books saw the solid principles

00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,010
I am Sol I D they're basically the

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,040
framework for saw of solid used the word

00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:46,500
to describe the word they are basically

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,450
the application development principles

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,830
that a lot of people point to in

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,760
computer science is how you should be

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:56,010
writing software Martin Fowler anybody a

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,850
fan of Martin Fowler and his work yeah I

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,800
figured okay Martin is awesome and quick

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,390
plug we did two interviews with Martin

00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,070
we did the the manifesto interview and

00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:06,810
then we did one about agile architecture

00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,459
and that was a brilliant sit down with

00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,560
him and Rebecca works Brock and if

00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:12,660
you're not familiar with her learn your

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,470
history Rebecca is a strong intelligent

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,390
woman spoke with Martin also one of the

00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,339
godfathers of XP worked on the c3

00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,660
project at Chrysler with Kent and Bob

00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:26,250
Andy hunt spoke about him a little bit

00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,080
now you can see what the pragmatic

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,750
bookshelf styling looks like on their

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,700
textbook on their books so Andy was a

00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:34,589
you're gonna see some quotes from these

00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,630
interviews in the coming slides you're

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:38,550
gonna really catch his southern charm as

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:42,480
we go through some of his his bullets

00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,120
there Alistair interesting gentleman he

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,220
actually has a lot of experience

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,510
researching teams and he had he had

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,430
interviewed something like a hundred

00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,990
successful delivery teams before the

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:55,740
manifesto event he kind of talks about

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:57,089
what made them successful the second

00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,750
interview that we did in person actually

00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:59,750
happened in London

00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,670
James grunting he's a local to Chicago

00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:10,510
guy also part of the original c3 project

00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:12,100
he if anybody has done test-driven

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:14,530
development before I think it's really

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,780
hard and software James is the guy that

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:19,660
actually wrote the book on test-driven

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,490
development for embedded C so he's doing

00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:22,630
it in embedded C it's it's if you could

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,160
pull that off you should be able to do

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,920
it and software relatively simply

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,440
he's also the inventor of the planning

00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,210
poker funny story behind that is in the

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,840
interview if you want to hear the

00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:37,030
history there and then John Curran

00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:39,280
John's got an interesting background he

00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,990
said that he was there by accident his

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,940
his mentor was the one that was actually

00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,350
invited he was not able to attend so he

00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,770
said John you go to this crazy thing

00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:49,270
waste your time with it John came up

00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:52,240
through the government space worked with

00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:54,520
the DoD and did a lot of flight flatspin

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,590
simulation for airplanes and jets and

00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,150
jet propulsion algorithms and all this

00:11:56,590 --> 00:12:03,160
crazy stuff that is actually rocket

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:05,050
science right but John is uh John is a

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,640
very strongly opinionated man and he

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,710
looks at the the principles of the

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,510
founding foundation of this country and

00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,710
applies that to software engineering so

00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,790
if you listen to that interview if you

00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,230
ever get the opportunity to hear him

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,700
speak it's really cool to check out last

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:20,110
one I'm gonna talk with any detail on

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,960
and hopefully I'm getting through these

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:24,870
quickly for you all is Roger freeze Ron

00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,730
is also another one of those XP guys and

00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,870
he has written quite a few books the

00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,510
extreme programming

00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,840
explained in that pink book is or in

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:36,550
most every engineering shop in the world

00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:39,010
I think at this point he's what very

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,290
well respected in that space

00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:44,440
if anyone's a beer nerd here's a fun

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:47,560
fact so Ron Jeffries has a son who's

00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,840
named Ron Jeffries right I guess version

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,640
two I was talking to Ron and when he

00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,540
plugged his Twitter he's like make sure

00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,730
you look for the computer science

00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:56,740
Twitter Ron Jeffries because my son has

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,930
an account too and he owns jolly pumpkin

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,000
brewing so if you're a jolly pumpkin fan

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:03,450
here's an attachment right back to back

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,970
the software again the beer theme I'm

00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,470
consciously aware of how bad the sounds

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:09,790
alright

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:11,560
we spoke to a bunch of other guys too

00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,240
and it's just out of the appreciation

00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,540
for your time I'm not going to step

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,130
through

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,320
there's probably some familiar faces if

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,840
you've been in this space before all of

00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,170
these interviews are available online on

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,880
iTunes stitcher google play or wherever

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,950
you find your happy podcast there's a

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,610
couple more in there it's agile

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:31,630
it's the agile uprising yeah where you

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:34,870
can get it right from the website

00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,730
podcast on agile uprising calm all right

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,260
so let's step into that if you remember

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:40,360
that three circle Venn diagram

00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:42,100
what were those secrets right the first

00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,760
one is going to be around technical

00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:48,070
practices so when we sat and we talked

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,190
to these guys obviously all but one of

00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:54,550
them were at the time of the signing

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,560
hardcore engineers right Jim hi to Jim

00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,390
Highsmith was more of a project

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,030
management focused consultant business

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:02,500
strategic consulting type guy all the

00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:03,970
others were hard core engineers so

00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,080
technical practices obviously were

00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:08,740
something that we talked about quite

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,550
often and if you're familiar with Bob

00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:14,860
the one thing that he is very strongly

00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:16,870
opinionated about is the concept of

00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,970
apprenticeship I was having a

00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,590
conversation at dinner I think it was a

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,140
couple of couple nights ago with some of

00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:25,750
the other speakers and I said when you

00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,130
go when you call a plumber you know that

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,750
plumber is going to show up and they're

00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,610
gonna have the ability to fix your

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,930
clogged drain your frozen pipe it's

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,550
freezing out now so your frozen pipe

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,810
because they've gone through an

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,330
apprenticeship program where they

00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:40,060
started off as an apprentice then they

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,980
went to like a journeyman a master or

00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,360
whatever that actual process is that

00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,790
does not exist in software development

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,040
the rate at which that we introduced

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:50,740
software engineers to the industry is

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,200
every five years it doubles right so

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:56,500
that literally means more than half of

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,000
the software engineering practitioners

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,580
have less than ten years experience

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,350
which there's a lot of juniors out there

00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,940
as kind of the point and the people that

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,320
are teaching them are relatively junior

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,150
themselves so bob has a very opinionated

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,610
stance saying that these technical

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:14,440
practices that are super important need

00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:18,700
to be curated within two people and

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:20,920
teams just because the technologies are

00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,900
changing the tools that we're using or

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,790
changing the underpinnings and that the

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,760
computer science engineering practices

00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,050
are pretty much stable and you just need

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,240
go back and gain gained an appreciation

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:32,790
for what proper designing and proper

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,290
architecture looks like so he wants

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,490
everyone he wants there to be more of an

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:39,780
attention on putting people and

00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:42,560
apprenticeship to each other still in

00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:45,960
that technical practices space

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,030
Andy takes the contrarian stance and and

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,510
instead of saying you should do this he

00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:55,430
goes cynical right agile now means that

00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,430
we do half of scrum poorly and use JIRA

00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:09,750
yeah damn it it is how many people

00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:11,970
actually agree with this dammit it is we

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:14,430
use JIRA now as an interface with people

00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:16,560
which is kind of crazy and you know

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,970
everything if we need to get our story

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,860
points more accurate the Fibonacci

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:23,610
sequence has but bastardize doesn't it

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:26,400
so Andy's point here more is that we

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:28,200
need to actually learn how to operate

00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,030
with technical patterns with technical

00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,890
people and technical ways and stop using

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,800
interfaces as the way that we

00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,670
communicate with each other he would if

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,930
you were standing here he'd probably

00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,640
talking more about that pair of

00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,810
programming learning from the heartbeat

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,510
of the person next to you so that you

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,650
can actually come up with mott thought

00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:53,070
mindful thought work and knowledge work

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:54,500
with better outcomes so the one that is

00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:57,330
one of the questions that was pretty

00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:58,920
consistently asked across the spectrum I

00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:00,480
appreciate a lot of these guys have

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,640
families and children and some don't

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,230
have families and children so I had to

00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:09,209
frame a question that would help really

00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:11,100
answer a lot of the questions that we

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:13,290
have for ourselves but make it personal

00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,720
to them so the question was if your

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,670
nephew or niece today we're telling you

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,680
that they want to get into software

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:22,199
engineering what advice would you have

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:23,610
for them right and that makes it

00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,470
personal because it's somebody that's in

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,170
their family so that that matters and

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,270
it's not like what should they study

00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,380
well you know should they be an engineer

00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,490
should they be off should they care

00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,320
about agile should they care about that

00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:36,210
adopts whatever it is the answer that

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,220
Alastair gave is the one it's up on the

00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,100
board he says hone your technical

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,620
expertise so that you can contribute and

00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,929
your listening skills right so it's kind

00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:46,760
of interesting that in one breath we're

00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:49,070
talking about technical expertise right

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,260
be a good citizen to the engineering

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,640
community but at the same time hone your

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,830
listening skills it's like those two

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,929
things generally don't mesh together we

00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:58,820
don't hear that that often and his point

00:17:56,929 --> 00:18:00,890
there is really to be a good engineer

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,480
you have to be you know conscious of

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,570
your environment your surroundings

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,270
I think I'm failing improving my

00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:13,070
arrogance right now so guys spin that up

00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:15,650
a little more so the word engineer it

00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:17,480
seems like I'm not sure if it's a

00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:20,590
cultural thing a regional thing or what

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,020
but I've seen quite often in recent

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:25,850
months years a push back on the term

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,480
engineer and I don't understand why and

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:31,070
to me growing up and even now I look at

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,140
people that describe themselves as an

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,419
engineer either a systems engineer a

00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,669
DevOps engineer just an application

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:39,500
software engineer I look at that as a

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,450
badge of honor and it's something that

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:44,150
comes with it some great

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:45,289
responsibilities and I think that's kind

00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,030
of what James is talking about when he

00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:48,380
says be an engineer and use your

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,860
problem-solving skill set when

00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:54,710
appropriate so the only way that you get

00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:56,659
to in my opinion be a really strong

00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:59,600
engineer is by experiencing pain and

00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:01,610
knowing how the decisions that you

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,830
technically make are inflicted on other

00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:06,320
people and empathizing with that impact

00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,179
and to improve your technical ability so

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,820
much so that you can reduce that impact

00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:12,409
because we why do we write software why

00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,640
did we work in operations we're doing it

00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:16,789
to make things suck less

00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:24,350
right so James is really driving into

00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:26,929
that into that point there so John's

00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,400
John's again I think we had about five

00:19:26,929 --> 00:19:31,730
beers before we started recording with

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,409
John Kern and his sound bites are

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,090
amazing it's just a shame they're

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:38,659
captured on an iPhone and not real soft

00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:40,299
not real podcasting equipment I'm just

00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,610
gonna read this one which is like

00:19:40,299 --> 00:19:44,990
presenting 101 never do that thank God

00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:47,150
things in this world are not built the

00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,650
way that we build software damned if I'm

00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,809
sitting in this building if it was built

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:52,799
the way we build software

00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:54,029
think about that from a releases

00:19:52,799 --> 00:20:00,690
perspective right we're at a DevOps

00:19:54,029 --> 00:20:01,980
conference would you if the inspectors

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:03,720
that go through and make sure that the

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,220
house is ready to be released to you for

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,360
your family to live in or the building

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,879
that you're going to work in is ready

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,580
for you get to inhabit it for for work

00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:12,720
what if they looked at that the way that

00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:17,309
we kind of hash works

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:21,690
that's called a curse that time what

00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:23,129
happens if they took their approach to

00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,450
their job the way that we sometimes take

00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:27,779
an approach the way that we either we

00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:30,149
release software we build software you

00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:31,529
know it makes it meaningful right so

00:20:30,149 --> 00:20:32,820
then you take that metaphor new apply it

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:35,159
back how can we actually be better

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,990
citizens to the release of the software

00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:38,749
releases the infrastructure provisioning

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,009
when we set up like these cloud

00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:45,269
orchestration systems I'm sorry these

00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:47,610
these container registration systems Wow

00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,590
how can we do that with more empathy for

00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:50,490
the people that are going to be using it

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:54,049
or the people that are going to be

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,049
supporting it after we're going right

00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,360
another thing you're not supposed to do

00:20:57,299 --> 00:21:01,200
as a presenter um

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,480
the tech one we're talking about

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,649
tactical practices oftentimes and I

00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,419
think this actually kind of feeds back

00:21:04,649 --> 00:21:09,179
to the bob martin fact about having a

00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,100
lot of juniors in industry we look for

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,019
permission to do things that inherently

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,039
we know we should be doing anyway does

00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:19,440
that sound familiar so you know one of

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,249
the XP extreme programming remember back

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,659
when you talked about sharing

00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:24,210
programming one of the tenants of

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:26,419
extreme programming is the practice of

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,619
refactoring going back and you know

00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:31,049
sharpening and hardening your code to

00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:34,440
make sure that it's as well groomed as

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:36,419
possible and a lot of times people have

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,619
refactoring projects which doesn't make

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:39,629
sense it's just part of how you write

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:41,999
software so Ron really distills that

00:21:39,629 --> 00:21:44,970
point down when he says I do not ask for

00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:46,230
permission to test a refactor any more

00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:48,720
than I asked for permission to write in

00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:49,980
a statement or a for loop right for the

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,049
programmers in the room that kind of

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,340
makes sense all he's saying is he

00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:55,080
doesn't ask permission to do the right

00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:57,059
thing he just does the right thing

00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:01,340
because that's how you are a technical

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:03,190
engineer in a meaningful way today

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,080
so hopefully

00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,190
established that technical practices are

00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,240
clearly important in the world of of

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,440
agile in the world of DevOps and that

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,790
and how we practice today

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,310
store up teams for a quick minute when

00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:21,040
we we sit there in Martin's interviews I

00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:25,060
think if it wasn't for me being on them

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:28,120
I would say they're really good but he

00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:29,350
talks about cargo cult and is any I'm

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,340
gonna assume somebody here doesn't know

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:32,470
what that means and all that really

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,980
means is that you go through the motions

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,180
of the thing just to say that you're

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,950
doing the thing without actually

00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,300
appreciating why you're doing it not

00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,990
actually understanding the root cause

00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,180
behind it

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,980
so it goes back also to what any hunt

00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:47,860
said about what agile means now is that

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,320
you do half of scrum and use JIRA right

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,790
that's what we actually think agile is

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,560
at this point and that's kinda what

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,240
Martin's talking about mindful teams

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,650
actually understand the principles and

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,630
the interfaces that they have with each

00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,890
other and they realize the impact of

00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:02,350
these things and when they go through

00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:04,960
the ceremonies you don't grunt and walk

00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:06,430
into a retrospective you go into the

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,230
retrospective to actually groom your

00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,260
team to enhance your relationships and

00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:12,520
your collaboration that's what that's

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:17,140
really what Martin was talking about at

00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:18,520
that point and you know you speak to Ron

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,220
Jeffrey so at this point is pretty

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:22,900
pretty gruff at times especially when

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:28,090
you get into a nice Twitter argument

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:29,530
with him he's really good on that this

00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,360
this is where we're gonna start stepping

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,370
into some some DevOps principles pretty

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,250
obviously right we need to know deeply

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,720
that we haven't broken the system

00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:40,360
there's probably been a few talks in the

00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,770
last day or two about monitoring logging

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:43,150
and alerting I know that we have some of

00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:46,600
the monitoring logging and alerting

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:48,940
sponsors here having an appreciation

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,680
like a team that owns their system and

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:53,830
knows the health of their system at all

00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:56,350
times is a good team because they then

00:23:53,830 --> 00:24:00,390
have the responsibility of making sure

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,390
that their systems are available right I

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,090
just I like that I see Martin's name

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:08,470
before it paints I'm like oh there's

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:12,250
gonna be a good one this one is kind of

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,480
meaningful to me because this this this

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,760
is the outcome

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,830
of the the question that I asked Martin

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,870
where if your niece or nephew we're

00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:22,660
going to be answering the industry what

00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:27,580
advice would you have and I'm fortunate

00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:30,669
I work for a company that is very good

00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:33,250
and I feel like you know I'm surrounded

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,929
by some of the smartest engineers some

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,669
of the smartest practitioners I've ever

00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:38,140
been lucky enough to come in contact

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:41,530
with and I get to do it on a day to day

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:43,299
basis on my worst days where I'm not

00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:45,100
productive at all I still feel like I'm

00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:46,510
a much better engineer than I was before

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:48,400
I walked in the door and I know when

00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:50,530
ever my time at Contino comes to an end

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,850
I will be in a position that is so much

00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:54,610
better than I would have been had I done

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:55,780
anything else with my time right so when

00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:58,809
Martin comes back and he talks about

00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:00,309
strong teams his stance is find a place

00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,440
that is doing a really good job and

00:25:00,309 --> 00:25:04,510
immerse yourself in that place so Martin

00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,890
if you're not familiar is the I think

00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,110
he's called the chief scientist of

00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:11,410
thought works and I saw go was out there

00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:15,549
so go is actually a byproduct of some

00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:16,990
fault works projects and he Martin loves

00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:20,799
thought works he I think he's been there

00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:23,140
for damn near 20 years now and he his

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,030
stance is that you surround like you

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,740
surround yourself with very bright

00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:28,150
people and you've been become even more

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,400
intelligent if you're the most smart

00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:31,960
person in the room you know that was

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,040
saying is if you're this mortise person

00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,210
in the room you in the wrong room it's

00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:35,950
actually true right

00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,270
you're not growing your brain if all

00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,559
you're doing is answering other people's

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,850
questions if you're not learning

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,590
yourself by the people that you're

00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:45,640
surrounding yourself with find new

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:47,950
people and you know what just to take a

00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,590
second these types of events right

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:52,360
these DevOps days just by the nature of

00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,070
sitting in these chairs and on the

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,559
benches back there standing wherever you

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:58,000
are I think you already believe in this

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,770
that's why you're here right this is a

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,679
commitment we're almost at five o'clock

00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:04,000
on a Friday in New York City and we're

00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,850
still sitting here learning from each

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,549
other so I wasted a slide by telling you

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:14,290
something you already know we'll keep

00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,549
moving like I do rise it is pretty much

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:19,809
happy hour in New York and I keep

00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:21,220
talking about beer so we should move one

00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:25,610
of the central concepts that people lose

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:30,510
is the thought of adaptation right so

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:31,980
how often do we do things in our jobs

00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:34,320
and I'm not asking for a show of hands

00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,400
here but how often do we do things

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,540
because that's the way that we've always

00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,220
done them right

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,480
lowering hands down that there are

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,580
better ways to do it and I'm not saying

00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,650
completely throw everything out and just

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,480
really like redo your deployment

00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:48,210
pipeline sir your containerization

00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,770
strategy but constantly experiment and

00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,120
tweak and measure and make sure that you

00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,230
understand that you're adapting and

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,690
you're making things healthier you're

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,920
gonna be wrong right I mean I I'm the

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,930
only person I know that's right all the

00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,340
time right continue no you're gonna be

00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,740
wrong but you have to go through and you

00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:05,880
have to like take those small iterative

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,530
steps forward so that you're improving

00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,950
this status quo of a standard operating

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:12,720
procedure of your organization that last

00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,150
circle right mindfulness let's talk

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,330
about mindfulness for a second

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,670
mindfulness just it's the ability to

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,610
empathize and to be like you've heard of

00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,860
emotional IQ EQ having that in the

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,750
context of your your team's your systems

00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:31,280
your customers your users you know your

00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:33,510
stakeholders all of that good stuff and

00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:35,700
if you remember what I said about Bob

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,040
having that really strong sense of a

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,810
need for apprenticeship he says I don't

00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,970
want to boil all of agile down to one

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,850
word or phrase but it does boil down to

00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:46,290
pride of works my workmanship right now

00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:48,590
we're standing here a dev out days or

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:50,400
I'm standing most you're sitting

00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:53,280
take-out agile and just put the word

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:55,080
DevOps in there right it's still

00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,090
resonates really hard doesn't it right

00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:00,210
we should be very proud of the work that

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:01,770
we do every single day and if we're not

00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,820
that's a really good indicator that we

00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,050
need to start doing those small

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:06,330
experiments and start tweaking the

00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:10,830
system or we need to surround ourselves

00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:14,280
with people that make us better at

00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:17,160
Martin again it's gonna be a good one if

00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:21,240
you're in the mud you aren't going to go

00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,920
anywhere big chunky dirty monolithic

00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,240
systems that take hours to release and

00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,980
every time you release it you find out

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,600
three services that were micro service

00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,430
they're actually first version dependent

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,300
and the whole thing started burning down

00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,630
around you we're talking about not going

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:36,180
anywhere

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:38,380
sometimes we create systems and we

00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:40,540
create

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,550
create these release pipelines that are

00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:45,490
actually inhibiting us from from moving

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,200
forward so being aware of the decisions

00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:49,030
that we're making when we make them and

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:53,470
how they impact our our systems health

00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:57,520
our car our users health I know of teams

00:28:53,470 --> 00:29:00,070
today still that do releases at off

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,810
hours on nights and weekends and if you

00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,560
think about the impact like let's talk

00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:07,960
about mindfulness how as a manager can I

00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,300
look at myself in the mirror knowing

00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:12,640
that I'm taking a mother a father a

00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:16,300
brother or a sister out of their family

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,190
putting them on a call at 12:30 1:00

00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:20,590
o'clock in the morning for two or three

00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:21,640
hours on a Friday night so that Saturday

00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,050
when they get up and that's their

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,100
downtime to be with their family they're

00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,510
going to be grumpy they're gonna be

00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,770
sleeping in they're gonna be pissed off

00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,380
they're gonna be handling support

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,580
tickets just be mindful of the decisions

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,990
that we make so that we make better

00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:40,330
systems that are more highly resilient

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:41,980
able to handle change yeah John did

00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:45,340
actually not have everything he said

00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:46,900
wasn't cynical but okay I I don't think

00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,720
I would add just don't through scrum

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:52,720
damn it use your brain do the right

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,920
thing empower your teams that's why

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,090
we're here today right that's what we

00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,470
want to do we want to get smarter we

00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:00,640
wouldn't have empower me in our systems

00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:02,980
in our teams so again these were the

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,530
secrets that I kind of feel we're

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:07,120
distill when you take all 14 of those

00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:08,980
interviews and you distill them down

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,900
these were the secrets that kind of came

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:12,670
out there's actually another secret that

00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:16,630
did not even a secret something that I

00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:18,880
for for all the females and then the

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,610
minorities in the room we did ask the

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,790
question why is it that there were 17

00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:27,160
old white guys that wrote the manifesto

00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:28,950
right I will share with you the answer

00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,210
that we got because I think you know

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:33,990
it's worth being said if you haven't

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:37,210
heard this answer before hear this so

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:41,380
Ron Jeffries gave me this he he said at

00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:42,640
the time there was initially a gathering

00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:45,220
called the Rogue River gathering it was

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,510
an XP conference sort of like the

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,180
manifesto event but nothing actually

00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,500
came out of it that was the sphere of

00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,710
influence that they had and that was

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,809
mostly

00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,429
white guys so when they came together

00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,690
and I started figuring out who do they

00:30:55,429 --> 00:30:58,429
want to pull in from outside the XP

00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:00,140
community there was nobody in their

00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:03,830
sphere of influence that they knew that

00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,380
we're not just old white guys he said at

00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:07,909
the time looking back now there were

00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:09,289
folks that were involved in the

00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:11,210
community that he should have had

00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:12,110
included and that is the one regret that

00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:13,580
they had because that was one of the

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,590
other questions what do you regret that

00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,940
was the regret that they did not

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,320
actually open the door a little bit

00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,940
wider it's for people like Mary

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,740
poppendieck to people like Rebecca

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,020
where's Brock to others that were

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,470
actively involved in the community but

00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,390
just we're not in their circle so that

00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:32,090
that stone got a little bit unturned in

00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:33,799
the middle of the interview so just one

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,649
make sure that gets through however I

00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:38,210
did lie to you these were the secrets

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:39,770
that uh that I think we're pretty

00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:43,039
blaringly obvious when you go through

00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:44,539
the interview session oh boy I did not

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,549
know my slides pretend I didn't just say

00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:47,570
that

00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:49,730
all right so teams need to build

00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,860
commitment to be the engineers that they

00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:53,450
intend to everyday right we're talking

00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,659
about talk about strong teams that

00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,580
that's what we mean mindfulness creating

00:31:56,659 --> 00:32:01,850
a strong sense of empathy for the teams

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:06,409
and the user so so it binds the approach

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:08,419
and the intent to the outcomes and then

00:32:06,409 --> 00:32:10,070
tactical practices I mean everybody's in

00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:11,779
here because we believe in the technical

00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:14,029
practices hardening and evolving with it

00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:15,470
with the market but build a deep respect

00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:17,899
for the craft of software engineering

00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:19,909
for this build respect for DevOps build

00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:22,340
respect for your users and your systems

00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:23,929
up and downstream and learn from the

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:27,710
thought leaders before you just because

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:29,000
a book was published I mean Tom you're

00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:34,340
when was your first book published you

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:37,159
22 2004 2001 there's still value in that

00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:38,179
book today well I'm not gonna ask you

00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:39,770
because you'll probably be a little

00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:42,559
humble but there's still value in that

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,750
book that book is 17 years old now pick

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,549
it up read it right he's extended it

00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,679
he's versioned it but there's still deep

00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:51,890
value in that these just because these

00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,570
things are a little bit you know dusty

00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:57,500
sometimes doesn't mean that they're not

00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:59,929
good so here's why I was lying to you

00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:02,750
there's intersection points okay

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:04,130
so technical practices intersect with

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,270
the mindfulness and they intersect with

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:06,980
the strong teams

00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:11,240
what you start seeing is the emergence

00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:14,810
of the people process and technology

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,830
right I make it up I saw pictures I move

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:20,210
too fast when you start having those

00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:23,900
intersections you start seeing where

00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:26,120
these things come out so that becomes

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:27,800
the lifeblood of organization and if

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,300
you're a DevOps practitioner you

00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,760
probably heard this people process and

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,320
Technology before that's actually where

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,250
the secret start to come together and

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,570
that's where these things start to

00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:42,050
really materialize into something

00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:44,240
meaningful for this audience so I'm

00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:46,910
assuming there are some people here that

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,190
support systems that are in the cloud so

00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:52,630
the cloud and were cast raishin so

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:55,160
things like kubernetes OpenShift swarm

00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,740
there means to create wild and reckless

00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,360
resource and financial risk financial

00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:01,850
waste if you do it for your company if

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,130
you don't know what you're doing right I

00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:06,500
can spin up 10,000 instances right now

00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:08,390
that's awesome I can use terraform

00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,830
script and just completely smoke a whole

00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:14,540
bunch of my capex for the rest of the

00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:15,919
year but my point here is when you look

00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,720
at these things and you and you're

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,880
thinking about the principles that we

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:22,790
kind of talked through today you need to

00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,440
learn from stand on the shoulders of

00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,510
giants if you haven't been in the space

00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,610
before go back to those resources

00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:30,260
sometimes bring in a strong team that's

00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:31,550
able to wrap their arms around you and

00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:34,159
guide you through the things that you

00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,810
haven't done before but one more

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,580
intersection right so we have the people

00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:39,110
process in technology in the center we

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:41,570
actually are talking about flow when you

00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:44,840
have a strong team and you have the the

00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:46,370
the people collaborate and communicating

00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,350
in a strong way and then you have a

00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:51,380
process that is actually dictated by the

00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:53,690
people that supports the way that they

00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,610
take a single concept and push it into

00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,410
production and then you have the tools

00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:59,090
that actually supplement the process

00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,280
rather than having the tools dictate the

00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:03,050
process that the people then hate you go

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,060
through the proper progression you

00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,930
actually have flow right you have

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:11,690
sustainable pace you have the ability to

00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:14,540
with high confidence release software to

00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:17,609
a production system at a very repeatable

00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,349
very fast pace with

00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:20,609
the ability to know that you're not

00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:22,109
going to break the system because we've

00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:25,440
instrumented we had telemetry and all

00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:27,420
that good stuff so really when I talk

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,920
about the secrets I cheated when I told

00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,869
you that that was giving you the last

00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,249
slide first this is what we're talking

00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:34,680
about with the secrets and to be

00:35:32,249 --> 00:35:39,900
completely honest when I talk about the

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:42,869
secrets I'm talking about DevOps so will

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,210
last a little bit we have a free

00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:47,519
community it's a slack community there's

00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:50,460
no marketing there's no advertising and

00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,140
not and it's wide open its global quite

00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:54,029
a few members already if you're

00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:55,920
interested and you want to clog your

00:35:54,029 --> 00:35:58,319
system with one more slack channel go

00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,630
for it it's DevOps debate it's you can

00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:02,460
sign up DevOps debate calm I said it's

00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:04,079
just a really good open free community

00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,640
for people to talk about things like

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:08,880
containers to talk about things like

00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:14,579
cloud you know all of that good stuff so

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:17,519
I came in under so who wants to throw

00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:20,789
questions at the guy on C is there any

00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:25,859
questions well first of all that they

00:36:20,789 --> 00:36:27,509
said yes I think that one of the biggest

00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:30,569
like for me one of the biggest things

00:36:27,509 --> 00:36:31,950
was sorry the question was what was one

00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:36,210
of the biggest surprises that I walked

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:37,769
away saying whoa from right and the the

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:42,739
true story behind us hasn't been

00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:46,259
revealed but that actual four bullet

00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:49,049
manifesto thing the way that actually

00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:50,670
happened wasn't that all seventeen guys

00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:52,440
were sitting around and they all threw

00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:54,779
these ideas together they were actually

00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:56,039
on a break so they did three sessions

00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,269
they did a morning session in the

00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:59,819
afternoon session an evening session

00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:02,789
with large chunks of time between them

00:36:59,819 --> 00:37:05,579
what happened was three or four people

00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:08,400
got around an easel and they literally

00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:09,539
just wrote those ideas down they will

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,339
not tell you who the three or four

00:37:09,539 --> 00:37:14,069
people are and one person was the one

00:37:11,339 --> 00:37:15,509
actually writing it and then when the

00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:16,499
whole team reconvened they talked

00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:17,730
through it and that's when they really

00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:21,059
said oh my god that's it and then the

00:37:17,730 --> 00:37:22,140
other really cool thing is the process

00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:23,609
that they went through to come up with

00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,470
the word agile if you remember the the

00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:28,920
placard it said the lightweight methods

00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:29,819
conference I don't know I just think is

00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,349
always

00:37:29,819 --> 00:37:34,229
they they called it the agile manifesto

00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:37,079
they call it the agile conference what

00:37:34,229 --> 00:37:39,569
they did is if you're familiar with XP

00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:41,489
index cards are really important so all

00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:42,390
the XP guys come in with index cards and

00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:43,859
they said let's everybody write down

00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:45,359
what we should call this thing and throw

00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,699
it in the middle of the room so you have

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:49,289
the 5x for you guys or jotting down

00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,690
throwing it out there everyone else is

00:37:49,289 --> 00:37:52,890
like scrambling to find index cards so

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:56,789
then eventually they throw them out

00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:59,759
there and they chose agile because it's

00:37:56,789 --> 00:38:01,410
the one that they hated the least right

00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:04,289
there at the office or the old ones were

00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,249
like adaptive a few others I can't

00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:06,719
remember off the top of my head but

00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:10,140
those are two a little bit that took

00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,789
away yeah so summarize the question did

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,099
anybody feel like they should have

00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,269
changed anything which to be 100% honest

00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:17,249
that was one of the questions that was

00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:20,009
universally asked and it was universally

00:38:17,249 --> 00:38:23,759
answered this way no they stand behind

00:38:20,009 --> 00:38:25,559
what was said the only change that they

00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:26,940
shared was what I said with Ron is he

00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:31,589
wished that there was some inclusion of

00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:33,959
women and minorities they they did a

00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:35,579
panel the 15 year anniversary and that

00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:37,910
question is also asked that's available

00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:41,069
in YouTube from the ones that actually

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,239
attended it and again they stand behind

00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,069
the fact that they wouldn't have changed

00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,049
anything they still say it's four

00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:47,190
bullets right if you think about it's

00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:48,749
really only four volts they say a damn

00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,609
thing about certifications or like

00:38:48,749 --> 00:38:51,839
methods or frameworks they literally

00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:55,009
have four bullets and they said they

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,009
stand behind all four of those still

00:38:55,759 --> 00:39:06,659
cool thank you

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:06,659
