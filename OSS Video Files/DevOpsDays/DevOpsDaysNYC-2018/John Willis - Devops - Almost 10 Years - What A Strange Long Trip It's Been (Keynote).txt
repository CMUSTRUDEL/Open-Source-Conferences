Title: John Willis - Devops - Almost 10 Years - What A Strange Long Trip It's Been (Keynote)
Publication date: 2018-02-01
Playlist: DevOpsDaysNYC-2018
Description: 
	A look at the last 10 years of Devops. What have we learned in the Devops movement from around 2007. Early Cfengine saturation based on principles of convergence, desired state and idempotency. Puppet becomes mainstream in 2008-2010 replacing a lot of Cfegnine for early web-scale IaaS. Chef in 2009 driving reusable infrastructure with recipes and cookbooks. Continuous Delivery becomes mainstream around 2010. Containers and immutable delivery models 2015-2016. Deming and Goldratt influence on Devops via Gene Kim. Formalization of Lean principles VSM via Rother’s “Learning to See” as well as Kanban for Software from DJ Anderson. Mike Rother’s Kata influence and Dr Spear further Lean influences on practices of Devops. Mike Nygard’s “Release It” circuit breaker patterns on mainstream and actually becoming state of the art in Google’s new Envoy/ITSIO design. 2010 Dr. Cook’s “Why Complex Systems Fail” reference in John Allspaw’s Web Operations book. Dr. Sidney Dekker’s Drift into Failure as input to the Netflix design. All the way up to Dr. Cook, Dr. Woods and John Allspaw’s recent 2017 Stella Report. Finish up with a look at where we are today and a quick glimpse at some potentially interesting new influencers (Cynefin and Simon Wardley’s Mapping).

00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:35,130
graphic presentation and David Edwards

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:42,450
did this thing a thought to enterprise

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:44,820
where to eat the poor man's Prezi all

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:50,430
right so that's the meal couple things

00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:52,949
Nathan Hardy who in the room so this was

00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:55,289
really you know one of the tricks right

00:00:52,949 --> 00:01:06,689
like you want to get selected but like

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:08,670
you know you're kind of getting so I'm

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:11,280
trying to go to DEFCON I'd be the chef

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,310
kind of like for years I started there

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,799
and I want to go back and OB because

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,049
they do this cool thing more I'm Jacob

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,930
gets up and and last year they dressed

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,520
up as kids in their own so like I want

00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,520
yeah I play guitar I'm like I want to

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:37,340
one other thing before I get started I

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,340
cracked the tunes over the holidays so

00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:51,380
there we go what a long I put in some

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,340
markers just to put a perspective of

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,680
technology so along the way I'm gonna

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,780
kind of say this was here this was here

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,630
is there too much time on it except that

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,420
I think most people who knew

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:04,640
you're a chef papa tarantula it's

00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:08,899
important to know that mark purchased in

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:11,930
1993 really invented the whole genre of

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:16,069
infrastructures poetry versions all that

00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:18,620
stuff and in actually Luke Cadiz founder

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:22,130
of puppet labs was actually an active

00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:24,560
very active cfengine user and just got

00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,720
frustrated by the user interface and

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,569
rewrote the whole thing but but maintain

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,380
all those principles of convergence

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:37,730
desired state AWS just as the market

00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:43,280
2006 for me you know and this is to my

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:45,319
lens sorry I'm the presenter of what

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,310
this thing is look like in its kind of

00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,989
past present future the I was doing a

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,760
bunch of Tivoli works about 10 years

00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:58,970
large enterprise infrastructure stuff

00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:00,980
sold my company had a non-compete so I

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:03,349
looked at open source solutions are

00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:22,850
Nagios things like that like what were

00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:55,609
the deans at the anyway like I really

00:03:22,850 --> 00:04:18,320
don't know like 10 years it was but I

00:03:55,609 --> 00:04:20,000
thought I would say lasted 10 minutes

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,639
I'm in the front of a front row and my

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,040
life is change because I realized

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,449
everything I've done was like false from

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,660
oh this was the right way to do this I

00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:34,790
spent the next couple of years baby

00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:39,530
mind you I'm not I think I am bringing

00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:41,150
I'd say I don't brag but I haven't had

00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,070
to pay for a job pretty much my whole

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:45,320
career except for about a two-year

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,330
period where I literally grabbed on the

00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:51,050
loose leg and said please hire me please

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,610
hire me any wooden and but you know the

00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:54,320
thing was I wrote a bunch of blog

00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:57,350
articles about you know like

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:01,039
infrastructure 2.0 this is like this is

00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:04,430
the way we need to do this this other

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,789
guy ping me : I'm Jacob said and by the

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,479
way he was a power puppet user doing

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:14,780
incredible infrastructure on bare metal

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,780
mist puppet and said oh we want to hear

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,490
a puppet story and I got the know atom

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,550
and we start learning a bunch of things

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:23,900
and and you know he was you know and

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,520
that time he wasn't really starting

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,710
stuff yet but he was getting some really

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,330
good ideas

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,190
going on and you gotta realize the cloud

00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:31,870
at this point it's like now actually

00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,090
getting pretty ingrained in Starbucks

00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,700
right it's you know starts to doubt the

00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:40,300
Sigma by this point like any startup is

00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:42,460
in fact the VCS are telling you that you

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:47,770
know you can't you know don't even come

00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:52,840
to us with a pitch I'm not sure which

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:58,930
came first the velocity 2009 horizon

00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:02,950
velocity or but I'm gonna say if you

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:10,420
Shafer you know I'm probably totally

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:12,940
gonna just so important in this DevOps

00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:20,260
revenue only thing about me my only

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:24,520
value is I connect smart people but I

00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:27,760
could explain how Y to this it answers

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:32,170
one of these people and so I listen to

00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:39,340
Andrew he was in a podcast early 2009

00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:40,780
with Michael Cote and I've listened I

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,250
knew and who were ready a little bit

00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,280
because she was early found her puppet

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:48,130
and any sort of an actual infrastructure

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,110
an actual operation and I actually

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:55,780
shouted somebody a little bit of actual

00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:57,820
or threatened tickler just a little bit

00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:59,230
about agile really going on and I was

00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,930
driving a car that was ran outside

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:04,510
rose and I called up I call the band

00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:08,350
room like what they're out is this and

00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:10,900
he's well as some dude in Belgium let's

00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:12,310
do it a bunch of stuff so I just come up

00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:15,130
trying to find this dude you're not

00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,810
talking about that a little bit but

00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:18,810
probably you know which significantly

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,400
2009 so most people I don't know how

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,120
many people who thirty people are kind

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,120
of familiar with the

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:41,720
okay so now I should go back watch Roxy

00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:41,720
to that man and the really give me my

00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:47,550
[Music]

00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:49,710
basically I was there and he he talked

00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:54,690
about how we did it we do ten deploys a

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:55,800
day it's liquor production license I I'm

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,650
in the back room I think there were

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,200
people throwing up you can't do this you

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:09,180
know my god you just try to the universe

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:11,970
right like this can't be you know it

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:13,650
definitely somewhere market time is just

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,150
again through a kid one of you is kind

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,680
of I got I'm going to use work probably

00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:21,900
incorrectly but I can't find a better

00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:25,440
work and I'll tell you his art which is

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:47,270
amazing this history in somebody help me

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:50,010
on the timing I know a presentation one

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,660
Schaffer we took that isolation

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,660
structure unfortunately

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,939
[Music]

00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,769
there was a way that you can do

00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:06,629
something and in fact we don't wonder

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,239
the slice that's been used by Emily is

00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:11,910
this got a Spock you know it's

00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:13,889
Scott you know they dampen ops right you

00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,419
know a little bit weird supposed to the

00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:20,129
boss things too hard screening them out

00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:23,039
right that was just metaphor for

00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,839
operation Devon ops but they aren't

00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,809
really laid it out like this

00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:30,149
introduction very well I'm a big fan and

00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:32,729
room for so many reasons but um he just

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:35,459
laid it down in a way that was you're

00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:36,629
not shocked at all it was it was just a

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:38,309
very good and I'll come back to

00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:40,199
something that was really important that

00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:41,519
came out of that presentation and almost

00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:43,259
everybody in the industry is taking

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,299
credit for they didn't get better for

00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,519
and then just kind of quit snapping it

00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:50,279
was just another one without him Jacob

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,399
and um he reads I'm working away from

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,929
the mic okay Adam Jacob and Ezra and

00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,819
never pronounce last name but the

00:09:54,929 --> 00:10:01,199
founder of a new yarn and this

00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:02,279
there and I'm doing I'm gonna need a

00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,319
little bit what was going on with the

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:06,389
chef thing he would kind of just was

00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:08,579
just getting it started the first thing

00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:10,069
in presentation he says I want you to

00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:14,539
run this command it said of Carl

00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:17,459
something something chef Stein SH he's I

00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:21,629
trust me we will kill your computer and

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,669
he does like the you all see Kelsey I

00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:25,829
tau or you see people now who do demos

00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:28,049
like like insane demos and their

00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,959
presentation but like you didn't see

00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:39,089
that back then you just didn't see this

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:41,339
like no holds bar and any literally and

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,319
like literally watch you to like

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,549
building web servers and infrastructure

00:10:43,319 --> 00:10:49,139
it was myself you know I mean the first

00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:50,039
time people use five out of my blood

00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,899
exactly he was sitting there

00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,970
presentation and you were just how many

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,930
that are here that are again by the line

00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:59,120
open up this file look at it

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,350
and you like that and Apache web server

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:05,360
and all this stuff but it looks like we

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:09,860
got it so simple right and you know chef

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,690
got started you know there is um you

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:13,940
know one of the real history points was

00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,430
the first step up stays again literally

00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:18,470
again I stayed that was nothing like so

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:19,970
for me it was like that guy did and

00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,250
you're setting the track down I finally

00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:25,370
got all these thing with Patrick he was

00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:26,780
running his effect and you know there

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,680
was some other side stories about him

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:33,950
and you literally get that for now but

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,570
so it was a mistake I yeah well we're

00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,790
running this event at the time I was the

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:40,400
canonical and I was actually working

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,320
Simon Wardley I was actually we were

00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,540
doing something terrible really just

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,670
horribly terrible we were taking

00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,620
eucalyptus is pre OpenStack and

00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:51,080
eucalyptus which was by the time but

00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:52,550
terrible brother and we were calling it

00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,780
you brought to enterprise class which

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,940
was terrible

00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:59,120
I mean you prayed to get the thing

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:08,360
started you know you know and I'm sorry

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:10,850
it just was terrible sure Ken dance and

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,520
the city was an interesting Renaissance

00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:18,440
about 40 maybe 60 people in my memory

00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:21,800
was 40 look it says 50 was closer to 35

00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,020
or 40 but um but it was as thick it was

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:26,950
a group of people know I've been doing

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:29,690
like a lot of years of this large-scale

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,010
Krusty Enterprise stop you know I'm

00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,370
starting here on shaft and all this

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:37,040
stuff may be switches young people that

00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:40,010
was so energetic about a new way to do

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,140
this thing and from there you know

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:44,030
actually link you homeland with you

00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,510
Sydney it's starting to jump move it

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,730
there Steven on some spin

00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,610
or engineer some other people I'm

00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:54,180
probably forgetting went to UK I was the

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,769
lone wolves I came back and decided the

00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,329
time I was actually working for chef at

00:12:55,769 --> 00:13:01,139
this point it was actually early in a

00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:04,139
chef and my boss was one of the the

00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,089
organizers of velocity and we decided to

00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:10,070
run in Mountain View in connection with

00:13:06,089 --> 00:13:12,839
the velocity adapt state to the US and

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:15,329
couple interesting points right so how

00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:17,209
did you bid the velocity way it's about

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,230
three days of like

00:13:17,209 --> 00:13:22,139
and one of the things we were really

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,329
worried about was like if you don't

00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:25,199
three days of velocity and two days

00:13:24,329 --> 00:13:27,480
deadlock

00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:30,750
are you gonna be totally burned out from

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,660
just two months and like so we can baby

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,579
should we do is before we decided to do

00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,740
it happen I remember like it's three

00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,230
o'clock on the end of the event there

00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,260
was still 275 people room and they were

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:45,389
just as passionate as they were and the

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,160
first day of a long city like I knew

00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:50,190
something was freaking happening and

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,579
again we're in perspective this was 300

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,850
people and I was 40 less than six months

00:13:53,579 --> 00:14:00,120
later David Edwards and I we do a Dallas

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,040
cafe podcast don't listen to it because

00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,170
we're so lazy you're just gonna yell at

00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,670
me next time you see me you're gonna say

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,850
hey when's the next time you're going to

00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:11,819
do it and I'm going to apologize so but

00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:13,680
anyway we're really bad at turning this

00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:16,260
into any type of normal business but

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,350
we've been afraid many years we decided

00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:21,750
to just talk about that effect it was

00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:24,569
such a mind I mean the damage they get

00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:26,610
was interesting I mean it was yeah I'm

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:29,130
gonna use a like a religious metaphor

00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,110
you know that and I wanna offend anybody

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:35,250
but like who's like Christianity was

00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:40,040
created in game but Constantine and the

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:40,040
Holy Roman Empire like happen

00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:46,340
that was real because there it just blew

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,880
it blew up you had velocity had people

00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,350
there and we actually came up with this

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,600
accidental acronym he tried to describe

00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:56,180
ourselves what happened okay culture

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,650
ordination management sharing over the

00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,600
years that's been modified they're just

00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,180
humble people

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,860
trams of cams with whatever you want

00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,340
you know actually today's Kathina I did

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:11,510
a state of loss today a complexity a

00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:13,870
little bit later but but the really the

00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,520
rethought about what can't really met

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,960
which was really kind of a feedback loop

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,300
ER it was going to get real technical

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,370
cybernetics feedback and it really is

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,180
about continuation or continuous

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:29,270
you know consult continuous improvement

00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:32,440
what a nation is you know the a kind of

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:34,880
continuous delivery or truce immigration

00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:37,640
measure is really a form of learning

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,130
just learning and sharing is the the

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:42,290
virtuous cycle that you share internally

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:45,020
and in fact you know like I'll have

00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:47,990
something about that upstairs externally

00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:51,620
is really the community about DevOps is

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:54,140
we've really blended internal and

00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:57,440
external right like you know back in my

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,450
day like you people just want to share

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,230
the organization if you're a bank you

00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:04,930
didn't show up

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:07,610
let me tell you how we're doing Google

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:09,650
Facebook started showing up really early

00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,150
in like yeah we run this we run an ad

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:13,130
and here's a cool office where school

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:14,720
like the think about was Ross about that

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:17,180
much just like it was part of the

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,520
preconditions in common I mean it wasn't

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,290
a rule but if you're gonna work for like

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,590
Park and he sort of bang you were to

00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:26,010
come out in linkage

00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:28,080
you do that we really can't use for a

00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,030
marketing solution you know you know I

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,320
mean it happens periodically but and

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:39,350
then you see all the stickers on the

00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:44,180
back this was an icon

00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:46,860
why Andrew Schaeffer is so important the

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,810
you know he kind of started this eNOS

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,150
you started seeing this all over the

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,860
place and I was even guilty I forgot

00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:54,720
that I was in his presentation and he's

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,240
the one that created it

00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,420
I actually attributed at one point to

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,250
another person who when he had this idea

00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:05,550
of the wallet confusion right which was

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:08,010
the greatest metaphor for ten tops you

00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:10,980
know dead of adoption and death throws

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:13,770
it over the wall adopts like again and

00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,450
then like you guys screwed up know was

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:17,550
y'all you know I think back and forth

00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:19,680
right and like what we started thinking

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,350
about like is how do we crush that wall

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,110
what is that wall in our organization

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,090
you know here is culture and it over

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,360
time to like we need to retain them up

00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:32,700
no it's a metaphor yeah it's a wall

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,420
between groups like and I'm a hypocrite

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:40,020
on that but let's say that for later

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:47,490
Jenkins came along and then there are

00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:50,180
other rapist or him back in his tend to

00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,180
police their Flickr

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,710
Chris Brown but he tweeted in this

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:12,490
interesting paper called why how complex

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:15,220
isms better by a doctor and a ditz these

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,690
Yahoo's call dr. Richard cook and at

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,540
that time Richard cook was not involved

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:24,250
with my team who really thought about

00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:26,230
the complexities it it's a genre of this

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,360
blog article you can find John's kitchen

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:32,110
so it's all there and he talked about

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:35,440
like my god like this is so IT and

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,540
without riches like he's listing these

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,970
things about what college systems and

00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,480
how they found and then John later

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,190
included in a book called I'm operations

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,780
interesting book 2 chapter book had to

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,940
come out six months later what it called

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,490
DevOps Tashman operations

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,860
it's got chapters from John it's dr.

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:58,179
cooks Aid and Andrew Schaeffer Patrick

00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:01,330
Adam gingka fish that are ready to throw

00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:03,640
her grease Lean Startup and John

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,220
continued like this if you start seeing

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,429
John's passion here of this whole other

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:11,500
industry of people who thought about um

00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:13,690
we started in hospitals and how do you

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,190
get to the bottom of this how do you

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,309
through system stinks

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,370
airplane crashes how do you actually

00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:23,410
just not to have a pilot air have done

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:25,929
right like how do you get like the Clark

00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:27,850
bodywork right then I can't explain here

00:19:25,929 --> 00:19:29,320
like a couple minutes but then he wrote

00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:31,750
another article about release

00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,150
engineering and the introduces guy named

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,039
Sidney Dekker was really a student I'm a

00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,200
whole bunch of people that are really

00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,850
mm including somebody Kobach the woods

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,609
sorry overthrown by the name down there

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:46,049
dr. Woods by the way was one of the

00:19:42,609 --> 00:19:50,229
people who was involved in the Columbia

00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:53,590
post-mortem serious stuff and John was

00:19:50,229 --> 00:19:56,649
basically telling us pay attention folks

00:19:53,590 --> 00:20:03,239
this is so relative to large-scale web

00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:03,239
operations act to freaking whale shows

00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:17,409
way to time to 12 people me and said you

00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:19,389
know I know you're an analyst I know you

00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:23,489
like you know bleeding technology you

00:20:19,389 --> 00:20:25,809
need to talk to this kid another king

00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:27,999
another key to change my life again

00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:29,789
right but I did actually talk to this

00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:36,190
kid Simon

00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:38,470
Solomon and this would explore anybody

00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:42,909
really knew about like what soccer life

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:44,649
they were actually they spoke to and we

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,809
had a lot of conversations and I was

00:20:44,649 --> 00:20:48,399
like okay I gotta be honest I didn't

00:20:46,809 --> 00:20:50,229
think it was going to be like it turned

00:20:48,399 --> 00:20:53,440
out to be but I knew it was the next

00:20:50,229 --> 00:20:56,950
shift for me Amanda Lee this was another

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,529
oh my god like containers this is going

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,629
to be different like it's another layer

00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,299
of like getting rid of cruft and all

00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:05,859
this stuff right so I got it

00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:08,139
unfortunately or fortunately I was at a

00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:11,979
company to get sold the dow i was

00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:15,909
actually bartering for first man in and

00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:17,739
and what was going to be docker and you

00:21:15,909 --> 00:21:19,299
know we like another presentation i

00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:21,190
wanna talk about all the mistakes I made

00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:23,409
in my life but we can have a fun with

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,059
that but I dropped out but it was

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:28,830
burning and I made a pretty good money

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:28,830
selling a company to Dell

00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,399
[Music]

00:21:34,169 --> 00:21:38,710
like there's been three rounds of

00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:41,019
organized here and this is the latest

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,409
but a sweet back and gang were part of

00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:46,269
the last generation and Dave's back out

00:21:44,409 --> 00:21:49,649
of Facebook and he's living the dream

00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:52,690
he's doing as I read his Facebook

00:21:49,649 --> 00:21:55,480
recently there but he read this article

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:59,080
for all Riley and Senate DevOps is this

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,299
thing called ice you know and like the

00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,019
casting I never we never created that to

00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:06,759
be located

00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:09,519
stop making after we did steak a little

00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:13,409
but what are these I loved about this is

00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:17,139
he said a box is really uncool suity

00:22:13,409 --> 00:22:18,690
complexity and empathy and and this is

00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:21,129
where I'm trying to get I was asked to

00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:22,869
used to be people invite me to a state

00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:26,049
of the DevOps right maybe just would

00:22:22,869 --> 00:22:28,359
give any presentation I want it and in

00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:30,399
the demo Chicago folks said hey John we

00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:33,700
want you to stay with them up but I

00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:36,309
really want you to do state all

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:39,940
right this is right about time this came

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:41,499
out and I um okay what's going on with

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:43,480
its inclusivity right we have got

00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:45,639
offstage growing I mean this is my

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,220
really I'm a better truck than this but

00:22:45,639 --> 00:22:54,190
as you've done but

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:55,600
accented all this this like awesome but

00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:58,029
you see there was some hockey sticks

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,409
between 12 and 13 right and some of the

00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:01,029
hockey sticks were the devil stage

00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:04,359
events were happening all over the world

00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:07,330
there was a demo survey going on to

00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:09,340
public lands and gene cams and you

00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:13,809
started seeing like we were expanding

00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:15,730
more people more cities that survey was

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:17,130
getting more data about what we're doing

00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:20,290
what we're doing

00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,360
you know for me personally this about

00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:24,520
time I met Bridget everybody you changed

00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,380
my life to extra number eases in fact

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,850
there's some real interesting history in

00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,250
this about that upstate New York right

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,070
so I mean dude that's what I think it

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:36,190
was probably 14 I get a little confused

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,840
on the timelines but we were we were

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,520
starting to organize the next Silicon

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,530
Valley DevOps day that was a local

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,210
organizer at for a couple of years and

00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:45,640
when you were like okay you know what we

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,470
saw we need to get more diversity when

00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:49,780
you get a better plan we need to get we

00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:51,640
need to UM we need like you know

00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:53,950
obviously these actually Jennifer Davis

00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,170
came in and was became an organizer

00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,910
overcoming you know I think we're going

00:23:56,170 --> 00:24:00,120
to be better at this and just do

00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:05,110
all-male conferences right which is we

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:07,780
you know I played I'm 58 and then I

00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,450
swear I just saw Brenda's presentation

00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:12,400
here indeed you are actually get here

00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,650
I'm pretty sure and it was an ignite

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,780
talk I'm like I got somebody is

00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:21,390
gonna be awesome and when you're by the

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:25,780
bridge of course she was always

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:27,820
perpetually and eternally awesome and so

00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:29,440
that was kind of a thing there where we

00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:36,850
started thinking more about like not

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:39,340
running all now agendas the enterprise

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:41,320
started getting involved I started

00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:42,070
wearing you a networking got me in all

00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,890
sorts of trouble

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:47,740
so network security started happening

00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,270
and we with a rugged manifesto another

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,630
interesting thing coda car that breaks

00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:54,900
tracks for you know I you know I go my

00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:57,220
memory until somebody tells me I'm wrong

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,870
but I'm pretty certain that after

00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:00,640
Shaffer is the one who needs to give you

00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,890
this front confirmation

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,110
it was Pittsburgh and and who wrote the

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,150
first one and said your head is

00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:09,340
we need to actually have a code of

00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:12,040
conduct and that became now it is

00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,600
mandatory on any day up stays and have a

00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,769
code

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:19,529
they go everything so um what else

00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,840
oh so I just talking about down you know

00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:24,350
ice inclusivity right we've doesn't

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,269
putting it down I mean complexities of

00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:29,700
long-standing thing and we were really

00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:30,899
starting it as an industry I think what

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,130
are these spirit DevOps like we're

00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:35,669
really going to try and look at other

00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:39,179
places and we had Richard cooks how much

00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:41,250
system smell Mark Burgess had written an

00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,840
amazing book incredibly hard to read

00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:45,330
go search a certainty which thing

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,519
literally good I got a laugh out there

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,840
you read it yeah I would say like if you

00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,509
don't know what the point like this

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,870
speakers hand open up visiting Google

00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:58,169
pages to read other stuff but but it's

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:00,929
an incredible book right and I didn't

00:25:58,169 --> 00:26:03,720
know by the way but Frank was so and

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,240
when he covers complexity and there's

00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,299
some other places you know system

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,049
stinking you know other areas but there

00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:15,960
was a whole push cybernetics and then

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:21,899
going back to e to ice I'm just one of

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:27,210
those ones really Jeff Susteren article

00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:30,389
that you know and he's like oh my god I

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,909
guess like we want one word like the I

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:36,990
rush gonna be head give you one word

00:26:32,909 --> 00:26:40,649
hops it's right you know and he nailed

00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:42,240
it and it really um really anything

00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:45,059
about everything I've talked a little

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,590
bit more about this but but it's all

00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,450
about empathetic transactions back to

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:50,759
your old days DevOps we talked about

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:53,399
defending engineers and he take options

00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,399
little bit endemic Roo you know you sort

00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:58,350
a lot of push of blamelessness

00:26:55,399 --> 00:27:00,149
retro Spence explain latest retrospect

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,149
is right all that stuff I can solve and

00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:06,470
the static transactions right you know

00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:10,360
just again my lens I've never read

00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:12,770
Jennifer Davis to Katherine Daniel

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,870
Johannes a little murder they were going

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:17,419
to beat me to the market the papyrus

00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:20,330
market how achieve and they dated and

00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:23,150
soon and I read it in G no Jennifer sent

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,250
me her copy you know but it's the

00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,140
industry ready for judo outfit up boats

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,750
oh my god you know it isn't really that

00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,190
big and I read it I never go hiking like

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,970
they covered a whole different subject

00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:39,799
there are skills and the time I'd like

00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:41,510
you know I like and then um about two

00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:43,130
years ago I actually wrote a course in

00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,010
Troy never complete renovation it's out

00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:47,720
there free and I wanted to cover it was

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:49,370
really going to be about this down said

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,440
work that I'm involved in her far about

00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,940
and but I wanted to cover more I wanted

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,770
to cover guys makes us better and and

00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:56,809
ruin it only seems we even covered

00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:03,710
handbook and I went back and I read

00:27:56,809 --> 00:28:06,200
effective DevOps everybody great you

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:10,429
know it again reasons why I think the

00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,799
first that he works you know because it

00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:16,880
was their perspective which is different

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:27,740
in four freaking guys Sam book now I can

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:28,640
never separate for really good luck it's

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,559
like we're receipts when you dinner

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,350
cover it you get it really read it if

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:39,529
you just talked about just you know

00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:41,179
heroes 84 months read our industry I

00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:43,610
mean it came to the conclusion at some

00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:44,270
point that that really whether you call

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,210
ice tonight

00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:50,299
that there's this umbrella of embassies

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,380
that preach integral of inclusion and

00:28:50,299 --> 00:28:54,679
complexity

00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:59,470
inclusion is listening and learning like

00:28:54,679 --> 00:29:02,440
looking for other areas other people

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:06,890
complexity is really just giving up

00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,130
deterministic thinking in Huber's I know

00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:12,870
that

00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:16,140
like this notable we will know we

00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:18,120
started racing a notion of that we can

00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,210
understand complex adaptive systems

00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:23,669
because they change so freaking fast so

00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,160
it is another form of empathetic or

00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:29,940
embassy in that we embrace complexity

00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:33,090
notices cool words but we actually start

00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:35,160
thinking about systems in not in a world

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,470
where we think we can turn a knob at it

00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:39,870
shout that look like this any given

00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:41,190
moment we started racing a whole

00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:42,990
different notion which by the way is

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:45,390
covered very well in mark about

00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:50,309
probabilities and and how physics for

00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:52,320
people do that stuff anyway then I say

00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:56,690
this was going to do some audio and

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,690
stuff but like that was good understand

00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:06,030
G kids now he's been in in a while it

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:07,590
was actually on a panel in 2010 but I

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,630
guess the Phoenix project will be five

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:11,309
years in February you know how many

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,280
people read the Phoenix project but a

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:17,100
lot yes it's it's a novel it's a rewrite

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:21,419
of an old novel from Elliott go rat I

00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,539
mean it put a stake in the ground in our

00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:26,340
industry you know and at the time I met

00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:29,850
Gina so ten year thing that he was

00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:32,970
working on and I remember um I met him

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,620
about six years in and him me and

00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,240
Patrick were talking about this is a

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,500
number right so the ended I was like

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,230
awesome than what I do

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,400
hey screw you okay so we can start

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,419
talking about like creating a

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:47,250
prescriptive guide to that novel and you

00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:52,260
know it's one of those like do as we say

00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:54,090
now as we do right but the it became

00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:56,669
about getting just got involved really

00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:00,030
early too and we really tried to create

00:30:56,669 --> 00:31:01,890
this guy with case studies and there's

00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:03,780
like 50 case studies I mean at least

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:07,080
starting from enterprise

00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:09,530
ugly enterprises I mean not just oh we

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,530
did that mom

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,390
I mean just a little it's a little over

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:18,740
year old minor two thousand copies sold

00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,790
this is breaking 14,000 now I did I

00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:21,170
think I'm thrown out

00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:23,030
I mean I'll just point you to the bar

00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:24,560
right exactly going back to New York I

00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:27,110
had written this are to some young man

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,840
committed suicide in the LA I got to be

00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:32,990
and it tore me up it didn't put me off

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:34,820
the grid basically I asked gene if I

00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:38,720
read blog article on his website

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:41,630
indeed he escalated it a lot of great

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,280
discussions and in fact the DevOps

00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:46,010
organizers invited me to do the key

00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:49,340
don't adhere the last step I think that

00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:51,320
plays here another thing that was

00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,600
interesting John all far had pointed out

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,920
this thing called the Ron Western model

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,780
the reason this is important in fact

00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,270
today John says he wishes he we did

00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:01,850
never introduce this which is another

00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:05,210
longer discussion but um Ron mystras of

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:08,690
sociologists that that basically looked

00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:10,310
at organizational culture not IT and he

00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,500
looked at organizations in three

00:32:10,310 --> 00:32:15,760
categories pathological bureaucratic a

00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:18,550
generative you know that just in summary

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,010
generative is kind of blameless faster

00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:23,780
you know learning organizations

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:27,380
pathological of blame fault but what

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:29,960
happened is 2015 that DevOps survey jazz

00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:32,150
humbled had got read this along with

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,530
Nicola forum who is actually a PhD

00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:36,140
statistician

00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:38,930
psychometrician they used this for the

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,300
sermon so now they didn't just ask

00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:43,460
questions like do you use shop so we

00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:45,260
would apply gilliam two times a day

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,660
right they actually ask you questions

00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:49,660
about get to trouble final

00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:57,190
hope you gonna say 20 or 30 one of the

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,010
things it really happens interesting we

00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:02,350
saw that that this interesting thing

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:05,260
that the Jenner cultures which you heard

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:09,880
times faster at producing software and

00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:12,130
the that was really satisfying was they

00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:18,070
were much more resilient empty target

00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:19,540
higher yeah I needed to know one of the

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:22,660
things that came up a lot was kitty

00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,880
Enterprise do this I'm ever watching the

00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:27,640
first Minnesota devastated screaming and

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,010
I saw a cross and Heather I'm like God

00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:34,140
she everybody else you can do DevOps

00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:34,140
without compromising into DevOps

00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:40,929
Ross a couple more things I thought I

00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,880
was got more time then rock word in 2011

00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:45,540
had this amazing presentation coach

00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,950
registration DevOps and it ultimately

00:33:45,540 --> 00:33:51,549
convinced me that it all started with

00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:53,169
Deming I went back and I really tried to

00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:55,360
learn everything I could about Deming

00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:57,040
and he was right in like bedrock Wood is

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,500
just good look and have some great

00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:01,179
father reads like 80 bucks a week is

00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,700
smartest anywhere they're killed or

00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:07,720
even like what that was like not love

00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:10,440
about this guy and he got me really

00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,450
thinking about this whole thing and

00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,550
primarily I can't recommend entire them

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:17,200
they skip every other lead book that

00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,859
exists honestly you don't need to read

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,200
impossible

00:34:17,859 --> 00:34:21,909
I woulda said this about a year ago but

00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:23,500
we you want to learn need and then

00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:25,450
understand how it relates to that often

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,740
spike roethlisberger Takata and then

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:31,089
right after that

00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:33,700
she was confident the learning again

00:34:31,089 --> 00:34:37,810
Edgar Schaefer comes back and he

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:41,080
introduces another landmark presentation

00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:43,480
quad city called basically there is no

00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,359
powered shortage and I'll just leave you

00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,129
with this this was recorded took about

00:34:46,359 --> 00:34:50,830
learning and it says that this is the

00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:52,780
best quality DevOps today you were

00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,940
either building organizational you will

00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,589
be losing two one

00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:59,470
there's things back on on hand and then

00:34:56,589 --> 00:35:01,839
some great stuff it got me thinking

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:04,180
about DevOps I tried to think about how

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,430
would I present this to an executive I

00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,680
came up my own mind at DevOps a set of

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,980
practices and patterns that turn human

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:15,180
capital into organizational today I'm

00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:19,450
really focusing on this DevOps ties an

00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:21,849
security devstack ops at RSA early last

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:23,650
year I saw a presentation by Aetna and

00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:26,980
it kind of changed me from thinking

00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:30,280
about rugged to demo cops in that it was

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,530
about filling in all the buckets and

00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,210
again I've been which had more time in

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,830
here and it's not my friend case but is

00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:37,349
like you think about the original blue

00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:41,500
bit bottom there's kind of the original

00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:43,990
kind of CI supply chain or split was the

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,210
first time and this is why I decided I

00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:48,070
gotta get about is a system static or a

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,990
systems approach with developers to take

00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:52,089
ownership and read these presentations

00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:53,680
you build it you secure it where the

00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:56,260
developers take full ownership of

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,960
security and in the end of five years of

00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:01,000
bug is a bug is about right and so you

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,460
start treating the same gates that you

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,730
create and you have to cover all the

00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:08,770
buck you can't just shim it behavior and

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:11,260
vulnerability scanning and you literally

00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:14,619
you want to shift left like you do it

00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:16,180
software security is software you have

00:36:14,619 --> 00:36:24,700
to have all those pockets in

00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:25,869
again you can find this if you want to

00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,109
about this so what I was gonna

00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:32,079
cybersecurity should think about three

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:34,030
four months ago and they had this hacker

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,190
he's in another room they they disguise

00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,559
his face at all he's basically making

00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:41,170
fun of us and he said that you know he's

00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,349
paid big money to go into banks and hack

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:47,890
these banks right and like and like and

00:36:44,349 --> 00:36:49,359
you'd go to reconnaissance and he was

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,400
saying you know how much is stupid he

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:53,500
that's right you should have Florida

00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,710
next five breaches he'd basically

00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:58,660
tailgate to get in right there somebody

00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,940
held the door open and I refused in the

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,619
morning kita dakedo hired to change my

00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,599
presentation they thought about like we

00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:06,280
talk about coaching from my behavior if

00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,380
you look at the cyber world of cyber

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,390
security it was like we did this battle

00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,300
for money on perimeter and all this

00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:15,730
stuff and we talked about culture but we

00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,619
get disconnected and I think about the

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:19,960
felonious you know something from about

00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:22,990
Bryson book like just this idea of the

00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,150
the floaties divided flow nice nature of

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:26,880
things right and the Bryson has did this

00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,579
book he wrote that what he said is that

00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,910
there was at a time when the last couple

00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,380
of dodo birds on the planet will be shot

00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,480
by just a couple of sellers that which

00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:40,660
is for no reason other than for fun

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,940
we're putting into extinction the last

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:46,359
couples out of earth literally at that

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:48,280
same time I didn't lose finishing freak

00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:49,510
up you right we're just changing

00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,940
everything that we thought about the

00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:53,559
world and he said it in here he said I

00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,599
never submit to you to find a better

00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:57,549
pairing of occurrences to illustrate the

00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,010
divine if one distinction of human being

00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:02,010
as an organization he was saying like

00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:07,390
what do you do for culture he did a

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:10,540
billion dollars this is one of the

00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:12,339
things that that that hacker didn't

00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,260
understand was he had never worked in a

00:38:12,339 --> 00:38:14,680
large corporation for five ten fifteen

00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,220
years

00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,230
that's what happens when

00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:22,309
you know Tom or somebody's coming in

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:28,730
after me and like use two paces away and

00:38:22,309 --> 00:38:31,160
I let the dorsal a problem but uh and

00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:32,900
some over the years you get so tired

00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,369
mark calls this the normalization of

00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,619
deviance like you just get to a point

00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:38,960
where like you know I can party to yell

00:38:36,619 --> 00:38:40,220
that I know every year it is the poster

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:42,140
that what I want to do this

00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,150
but what do you do you hold the Darwin

00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:50,390
and sorry what about I added this my

00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:52,760
presentation here is it's February it's

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:57,109
raining and she's landing it's horrible

00:38:52,760 --> 00:39:00,020
and it's snowstorm and Susie is pregnant

00:38:57,109 --> 00:39:03,230
with a bunch of boxes entering and she's

00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:07,010
two paces behind you and you left the

00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:09,170
door slam right and you're like but you

00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:11,869
wait is your exam in and you're you're

00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:14,510
you're a good person right and usually

00:39:11,869 --> 00:39:17,569
comes through badges head and you're

00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:20,329
waiting and she says John it was so

00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:22,010
thank you because you just you remember

00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,960
that this hacker told I didn't tell you

00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:26,930
the hacker said four to five breaches

00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,619
like we've got in through tell me comes

00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:34,279
in puts a raspberry P I have an empty

00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:36,380
queue like we spent a billion dollars

00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:38,690
when we get to a culture for this

00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,609
situation the person says I want to

00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:43,630
thank you because you made us stronger

00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:49,920
you guarded us against our adversaries

00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:51,960
right I said that John is an archetype

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,020
he's doing that with staff oh he's taken

00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,890
to his thesis he's totally embraced us

00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,510
in resilient safety some future things

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,750
if you haven't seen cyber warranties

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:07,740
mapping it's cool stuff it fits a

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:10,700
specific domain at in your khakhra over

00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,900
at home Amazon is using it for strategic

00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,400
James are proud of me and I know it's

00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:17,160
also using spooky dark so I'm really

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,049
proud of people using this if you know

00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,230
anything about condemning it fits into

00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:24,839
the comp and omein and they don't this

00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:26,970
end with something that I was pretty

00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:29,520
passionate about I'm calling my smashing

00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:32,640
project you know so we've learned a lot

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:34,799
to Moline and John has introduced a lot

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,510
of heavy hitters we shouldn't use

00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:38,400
backers whatever you guys not out or

00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:40,559
less double year thing kind of like each

00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,700
other John would disagree they

00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,460
definitely don't talk to each other and

00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:46,170
they don't collaborate and so I went to

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,640
Jean I'm like I want to kind of atom

00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:50,069
smash this because there's so much

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:52,200
commonality between resilient faith and

00:40:50,069 --> 00:40:52,890
stuff for Rother talks about and Steven

00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:56,180
Spielberg

00:40:52,890 --> 00:41:01,650
so a demonstrator by summit we invited

00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:04,079
city Dekker Stephen Spears hobo um well

00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:06,150
Dekker and cooked are dr. Kirk and

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,960
resilience people and Stephen Spears as

00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,760
lean we did a four-hour videotape thing

00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,799
and the first three hours they were

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,319
actually rude being it was it was

00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:19,109
incredible by the last hour is like my

00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:20,640
largest agreement and but you will see

00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:23,010
publicly now we're going to actually

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:25,410
introduce a lot of the video later is a

00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,809
panel that's online whether they're like

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,240
like hugging each other and kissing and

00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:32,369
and I want to do this more with the

00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,190
academia specifically or three so we

00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:36,869
didn't work on a project it's a audio

00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:40,140
only book copy on the Phoenix project

00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:42,960
that's going to be out basically in

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,400
February where we're going to cover that

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,930
we're covering a whole bunch of stuff

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,040
it's five years at speed

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:51,890
alright so and

00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:55,710
so one last thing I will say is

00:41:51,890 --> 00:42:04,770
diversity is hard for us old white guys

00:41:55,710 --> 00:42:10,320
I thought I was all male and like I

00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:12,540
didn't think about unless he was a tough

00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,780
year for me so I got I got beat up

00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:18,930
really bad thought it was I mean I'm not

00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:22,560
sexist I'm not like thing I get

00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:25,140
diversity but I still suck that and I

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,120
didn't even know that and and I was on a

00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:30,000
couple of all males but I got called out

00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:34,200
and one I got real defensive and had a

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,700
nervous breakdown be honest with you but

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:40,800
the truth is I made a pledge I'm not

00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:45,660
going to go to any conference that's all

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,520
now I will not speak on any freaking

00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:49,440
panel that's all now and now let's treat

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,940
I don't so I didn't ask to be I mean the

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,530
jacket and it's the right thing you know

00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,640
if you don't understand that then don't

00:42:55,530 --> 00:43:00,000
work for somebody else

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,620
but um but buddy you know you had to

00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:04,050
come through this horrific tunnel for me

00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:08,970
I realized I wasn't really as good as I

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:14,510
thought I was but it did again change me

00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:14,510
and I think now it's so easy

00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:29,590
