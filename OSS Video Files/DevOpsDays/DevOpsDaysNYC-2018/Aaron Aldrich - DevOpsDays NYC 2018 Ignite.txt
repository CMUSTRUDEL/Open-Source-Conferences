00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:19,170
hey I'm Aaron Aldridge

00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,600
I'm elastic my information is vaguely up

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,939
there and I will talk about some the

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,830
lessons I learned about how humans is a

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:28,460
complex system operate from the lessons

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,980
I got from people know from computers

00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:33,000
specifically about MTBF and MTTR so some

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,040
quick things what are we talking about

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,899
mean time between failures versus mean

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,690
time to resolution specifically

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:41,579
optimizing for instead of the time that

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,950
we can spread out the failures how vast

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,500
that impact is an actual recovery how

00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,329
quickly you can come back for that we're

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,190
also dealing with complex systems so

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,420
what do we mean here the systems are

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,100
always changing they have a lot of

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,219
component parts they're probably not

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,289
conceived of whole cloth and the same

00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:59,489
input doesn't necessarily generate the

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,989
same output there's some emerging

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,690
behavior that can happen in these types

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,250
of systems when we design things for

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,990
reliability a lot of times we're

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,220
building very rigid structures we're

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,400
trying to predict how things are gonna

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,900
fail and how we can avoid that but it

00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,299
can create some other problems it's not

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:17,100
necessarily what we want what we want

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,810
our systems that are resilient things

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,189
that can bounce back from failure they

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:21,869
can deal with unknown circumstances

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:25,049
something where we can have a new

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,850
problem and still deal with that and

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,860
what happens when we build things that

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:30,630
are avoiding failure and we keep trying

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,420
to build towards that we kind of build

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:34,650
workarounds for our structured systems

00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:36,689
sometimes that can be a little bit

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,250
glitchy and sometimes that can we detect

00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,570
that things that we know we need to go

00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,909
back and fix the right way but never

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,369
actually do and this happens with people

00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,750
- turns out if you just keep pushing

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,270
things down into relationships you can

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,250
also build that back the nice thing

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,899
about complex systems they take a lot of

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,119
things to break before they catastrophic

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,500
we fail the terrible thing about tech

00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,149
debt is you can end up with cascade

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,680
severe scenarios where one thing breaks

00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,840
and stresses another weak point and so

00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,990
on and so forth that line causing a lot

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,400
of problems consequently there is no one

00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,770
root cause to failure in complex

00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,970
and people you should just know that if

00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:11,380
you're doing root cause analysis and

00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,750
complex systems you're not actually

00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:16,510
fixing problems the same is true of

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:19,780
people so how can we actually mend that

00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,670
we need to live in blameless cultures we

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,140
need to be allowed to fail and not have

00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:25,420
a finger pointed at someone for being

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,820
the cause of that failure we need to

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,560
actually be able to go through that

00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,000
process so that we can learn to improve

00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,290
figure out where in the system things

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,330
went wrong so we can work on that

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,760
because experience with failure is

00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,580
necessary to avoid failure if we don't

00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:41,250
actually know what we do that causes the

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,390
failure we don't know how to avoid it

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:45,430
same thing with people if I don't know

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,050
what in a conversation might trigger a

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,060
particular emotional response from that

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:52,630
person I don't really know how to avoid

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,310
doing that it's also how we operate that

00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,780
potential right we know when to push the

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,090
envelope forward and take those risks

00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,860
when I know when to push you forward may

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,390
be out of your comfort zone or when I

00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,750
need to create an environment of safety

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:05,770
we can't really live up to our potential

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,750
so that means we might have to have some

00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:09,760
hard conversations and what matter for

00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,140
having conversations the TCB right I

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,239
want to make sure that what I'm saying

00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,550
to you is received in the correct order

00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,380
and with the correct intentions shouty

00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,820
conversations happen when both sides

00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:21,850
feel they're not being heard so they get

00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:24,220
louder so here's a technique what you're

00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,860
saying is X and what I'm hearing is Y

00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:28,269
where X is verbatim what you have said

00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,489
so that person understands that you

00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:31,660
heard the words they said but what is

00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,340
how you're actually interpreting that

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,019
what it's saying to you and how you were

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,040
interpreting that message that when you

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,040
complete the handshake they're on the

00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,390
same side at elastic we work distributed

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,720
so we build distributed systems and

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,040
we're in 30 countries and speak 19

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,019
different languages and use a lot of

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,180
slack so we're trying to do some amount

00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,400
of translation through text which is

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:53,140
hard so we have to assume good intent

00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,940
there is actually you know a turn of

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,410
phrase like get the most bang for your

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,790
buck does not necessarily translate to

00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,040
somebody lives in Austria they don't

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:01,660
necessarily know what that means so we

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,580
have to assume people don't mean to

00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,930
offend each other off hand but it

00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,670
doesn't mean it doesn't happen so we

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:10,090
actually of a / zoom command in our slap

00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:12,040
so if you're communicating and maybe not

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,510
quite meshing you can type / zoom and

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:15,519
immediately start a video

00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,949
and avoid those abstractions you get as

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,049
close to personal conversation with

00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:22,840
someone as possible and still remain

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,760
thousands of miles apart so this is

00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,830
another tool called non-violent

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,720
communication this is really good if you

00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,570
have a relationship that is hard to fix

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,370
let's still want to it breaks a

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,900
conversation down to specific points it

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:37,770
provides a very strict framework for it

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,400
so you can separate these concepts

00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:41,350
observations are things that have

00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,560
happened like a microphone or a camera

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:45,729
can pick it up you want judging the

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,860
feelings that are going on behind that

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,360
your feelings aren't like I feel

00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,310
abandoned because that's a lot of

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,470
interpretation but like happy or sad or

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,770
angry needs are very core human needs

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:58,600
and requests are demands it's something

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,320
would you be willing to do this in the

00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,970
future you have to leave room to say no

00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,699
there's a lot more do that it's

00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,479
something that only works in

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,100
environments that have safety and have

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:10,330
trust there are some other things you

00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,100
can do with that in a very safe

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:14,680
environments I'd love to talk more in an

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,140
open space about all this so how's that

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:25,069
for transitions

00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:25,069
