00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,670
my name is Henk Waterhouse I'm here from

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,279
launch tartly and I thought it would be

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,930
really useful if I defined DevOps terms

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,099
for everybody who has been nodding along

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,800
and pretending you know what we're

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,720
saying but instead I decided to be

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,930
sarcastic and cynical about DevOps terms

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,930
because that's much funnier so

00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:39,059
infrastructure a now that means the

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,090
teetering edifice that we labor to

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,010
simultaneously uphold and reform much

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:50,489
like trying to change the tires on a car

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:53,160
that's moving continuous integration the

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,739
state of never being entirely sure you

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,590
didn't just break the bill for everybody

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:04,890
it's like a continuous wonderment and

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:07,740
exciting experiment the cloud has three

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,229
definitions first is other people's

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,820
servers the second is an abstraction

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,720
layer for spending money like you

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,720
couldn't get hurt

00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:21,170
is the vaporous form of pixie dust it's

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,750
all in your head

00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:28,709
deployment when code escapes into public

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,619
view having Claudius way out or that

00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:36,090
thing that just took down production

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:37,709
yeah katal it pets it's a way to detect

00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:43,079
oneself from the suffering of

00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:45,890
individuality it's a great model for

00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:50,640
people who don't know any actual cows

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:52,950
the cows mean time to recovery how much

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,469
a plant yells at you while you're trying

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,170
to get stuff back up and looking the

00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:04,170
words they use so you know some have

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:06,450
meaner times than others agile a design

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:19,950
perspective centered on moving fast and

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:22,410
dodging definitions production is a very

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:24,660
pronunciation of the word Yolo

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:36,239
which stands for you only lived once or

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:38,730
I didn't like this job anyway of making

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,400
things fail really consistently with no

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,740
human oversight in case you make sure

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,630
your failures were

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:51,760
predictable free microcircuits a small

00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:53,980
independent operation that multiplies

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,980
the complexity of your testing and the

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,540
nightmarish this of your Diagnostics it

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,160
could have been anywhere it could have

00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:07,180
been any service or it could be a pipe

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:09,190
between them in here a box to put inside

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:13,000
another box read aloud a box that you

00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:17,920
can then use to ship boxes two boxes I

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:21,700
know I its boxes all the way down for

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,580
box turtles so something as code is an

00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:28,750
honorary title signifying that it has

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:30,970
been scripted or that it's tracked or

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,480
that you couldn't do any holes on it but

00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:36,910
it is scripted so that's important silo

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,680
a security device to prevent the

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:40,630
accidental transmission of the building

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,820
with anyone apartment to any other

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,570
department because god forbid that

00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:50,440
should happen

00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:52,990
security first nine nines are a unit of

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,360
failure and the more nights you have the

00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:57,280
harder than terrible it's sort of like

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,890
juggling like there's just a finite

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,360
number of nines you can have and they

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:04,620
get more expensive and then when you

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,120
drop them it's more catastrophic logs

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,090
heavy objects used for building

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,890
assumptions and also rolling over

00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,890
anybody who gets in your way with the

00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,910
observability the ability to tear it up

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,610
tell what's going on pear-shaped with

00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:27,420
high cardinality I don't know what

00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,420
happened to my parents

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,590
[Applause]

00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:48,510
do we have some blocks for that shift

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:51,120
left is a key that is next to a be

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,190
testing is a way to show a new bug come

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,100
only half of your customers appetite

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,690
it's great some people think there's

00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:05,030
some people it makes it super fun to

00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:07,470
track down chaos engineering last one

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,470
introducing poof licking monkeys to your

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,310
production environment on purpose

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:16,050
because that seems like a great idea so

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:17,490
thank you all for your attention I will

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,930
be holding an open space on

00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,930
documentation and DevOps

00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,709
