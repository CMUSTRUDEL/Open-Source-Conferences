the insurance first we have Jade our

00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:09,500
first speaker he writes at blog jeeva

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,660
bloom com he treats us at citing you can

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,670
click once we're on the hob saison page

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,760
for this event so you install that out

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,930
so Jane is pursuing a PhD in design at

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,220
see him naturally should take an

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,020
opportunity to talk with him about it

00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:23,430
because it's a there's a lot more depth

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,050
to it apparently I was the first program

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,640
where you can get a PhD design in the

00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,010
United States and he has some

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,619
interesting insights into that he is a

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,020
chief flow officer at practice flow the

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,809
company he formed Kevin bear in 2014 I

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,930
think most people Kevin isn't and so

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,550
that may be of interest to you as well

00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:44,070
his dog as you can see is on complexity

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,800
science and so without further ado if

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,800
Jaden come on up any monkey's welcome in

00:00:53,149 --> 00:01:00,780
hello can everybody hear me the mic on

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,090
yes it is excellent so I've been through

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,580
the updates before but never spoken

00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,620
so there's my first Wang excited my

00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,510
inner anthropologist is particularly

00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,190
excited to be in a culture that's

00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:18,350
obsessed with culture it's kind of like

00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:21,530
a recursive excitement so my talk is on

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:24,229
complexity science to really incredibly

00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:27,290
problematic words that Dave asked me to

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:30,470
put together for you so I think it's an

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:34,360
interesting framing and I'm going to try

00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,880
to do my best to explain those words

00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:40,160
relatively well i think i'm going to

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,060
start in a very strange place related to

00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:46,810
my research PhD student and the first

00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:52,130
place wanna start is this so this is the

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:54,830
mystic god krause brief God Chronos he

00:01:52,130 --> 00:02:00,229
will see Chronos looks a lot like death

00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:04,030
or what we would call father time so he

00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:09,260
has a nice flower glass and a simple

00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:13,220
promise is highly related to mechanical

00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:17,290
time so that's why he's got this is this

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,880
Sam timer and he also is related to

00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,570
beginnings and endings so the sickle is

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:26,739
about harvest is both about planting and

00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:30,640
harvesting right so I in this way he

00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:33,080
almost idealizes the concept of having

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,600
mechanistic science the relationship

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,410
between beginnings and endings causality

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:43,360
things like this um we're out and talk I

00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:48,350
will be hard rafting in with kaerios so

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:52,480
kaerios is a is the youngest of the gods

00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:56,450
in the Greek pantheon and he represents

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:59,360
opportune time the moment of decisive

00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:03,799
decisions the moment of making a

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,730
decision in the locust so whereas

00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:08,269
promises

00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:11,720
kind of quantitative kaerios is very

00:03:08,269 --> 00:03:14,269
qualitative and the nature of the stuff

00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,010
the decisions that you make when you're

00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,760
in the presence of kaerios are very

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,040
decisive their permanent they fracture

00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,640
the way that you're thinking this is

00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,920
represented nicely by he's holding a

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,260
scale on a knife's blade is some of his

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,930
thing representing kind of like that

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:34,970
decisiveness he's also got a very long

00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:38,360
lock on the front of his head you're

00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,920
supposed to seize the day carpe diem and

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,780
this is where that comes from is this

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,900
lock on the front of the citrus book to

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:50,170
seize carry-ons um so time which are

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,540
both these gods are both high and gods

00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:56,599
in the Greek pantheon there's two is

00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:01,000
intrinsically interrelated in complexity

00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:04,129
and that's a lot of my research so

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,989
complexity itself is is a terrible word

00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:08,329
to try to find I'm going to have to

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,769
spend an inordinate amount of time at

00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,079
the beginning of this trying to explain

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,209
it but let's just start with a very

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,810
simple version of what complexity might

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:20,959
be so if I took a normal pendulum that I

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,320
swung it it would swing back and forth

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,960
and the possible locations of the

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,729
pendulum on single point pendulum are in

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,300
a straight or curved line that the

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:34,910
entire phase phase is here right so the

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,910
days space means all the possible points

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:40,220
that the system can reach so a single

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,800
pendulum is a very simple system it has

00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,750
a very small phase space what

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,070
differentiates a double pendulum which

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,350
is

00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:49,990
watching right now for a single pendulum

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,390
is largely the amount of phase space

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,770
that it can cover so in other words the

00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:59,080
blue line in particular has covers up a

00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,810
lot of space it can go in a lot of

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,850
different directions and the result of

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:07,300
this is that whenever you have a system

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:11,230
that is eaten this simplistic right so

00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,180
it's only two potential interrelated it

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,130
can create a book what would be called a

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,260
chaotic system so it's impossible to

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,330
know where the pendulum of the blue

00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,950
pendulum will go next it's also possible

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,410
to know where the red pendulum will go

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:28,470
next because it's being driven by an

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:32,260
interaction the blue net yeah so

00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:35,350
complexity in this way is hope is only

00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,000
the difference between one system and

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,310
another system interacting with it just

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,090
just one more system causes is vegetable

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:44,920
extra right and in fact this particular

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,480
system with this is what we would call a

00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,250
chaotic system it requires you if you'd

00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:53,590
like to know how it will play out you

00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,080
have to actually let it play out time

00:05:53,590 --> 00:06:00,220
has to occur in order for you to see the

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,440
result one of our little thing about

00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:06,220
time and we'll go on to the next little

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,040
piece I think this is particularly

00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:12,040
interesting for developers and operators

00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:15,120
right so the more complex the system is

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:19,810
the war the system is like that pendulum

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,320
the longer the effects of its results

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:27,010
can stay hidden in time so one of the

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:30,190
reasons we prefer as developers and off

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:33,610
people simple systems is because it

00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:36,130
closes the cause-effect gap right a

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,460
simpler system actually has less time

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:42,190
between what the cause and effect the

00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:44,050
more complex the system gets the more

00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,780
that this could have a cause that has a

00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,640
long duration until the effect and this

00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,640
causes a significant problem because we

00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,010
actually have a hard time as humans

00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,280
correlating long distance cause and

00:06:54,010 --> 00:07:00,550
effect it's a really big problem right

00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,620
so time not only causes complexity which

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,300
is kind of we'll get into some of the

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,960
ways that complexity is but it also

00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:10,300
causes this particularly difficult form

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,090
of cognition which is noting something

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,669
that happened a week ago is causing a

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,870
results a week later and actually

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,090
noticing that those two things are

00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,680
correlate very difficult to do and the

00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,200
more complex the system is more like

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:30,090
that snap so complexity itself the word

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,500
complexity and science is is very tricky

00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:34,060
there's a lot of different meanings to

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,380
it and so I'm going to spend a little

00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:38,230
bit of time making sure that I don't

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:41,680
decapitate myself in front of you I need

00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:43,960
to walk through some of the definitions

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,669
of complexity so you guys have a good

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:51,669
idea of it now all of you should after

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:55,960
this read Marx a description of

00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:58,780
complexity which is here and note that

00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,639
my version of complexity is not in

00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,979
virtual compile

00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:06,150
right so his version of complexities is

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:08,189
very science physics paste and that's

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,509
great it's not what I'm going to talk

00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:12,300
about today although i'll talk about

00:08:09,509 --> 00:08:15,090
parts of it my version of it is much

00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,939
more from social sciences and you should

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,789
read his blog post only and if only to

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,349
know why some people object to the way

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:26,300
that I described complexity so I think

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:30,449
it's important so first of all

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:33,930
complexity to work duplex d is calm its

00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:37,260
width and its vector and it's so this

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,000
means entwined so this is the complexity

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,010
you almost always have to think of as

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,839
being the way that parts are kind of

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:46,230
intermingled together and inseparable

00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:49,620
thank you can't kind of capable part and

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,620
there's different ways that to think

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:57,779
about that in trials and the parts but

00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:01,440
in general complexity theory is the

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:04,920
study of the Murie ology right so the

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,100
relationship between tarts and holes and

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:11,459
the way that those parts become holes

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,459
and then behave is non-deterministic

00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:20,459
systems then it will dynamically over

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:23,160
time that's one definition the kind of

00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,800
more vernacular definition of complexity

00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,560
is best described as complexity versus

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,380
simplicity right so this is any

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,839
developer who's who said like keep it

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:35,279
simple fluted right this is the

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,380
complexity that we're talking about

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,449
there right so this is complexity as in

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,850
it's bad because I can't understand it

00:09:39,449 --> 00:09:43,800
the interface is too cluttered right and

00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:46,260
too complex to understand what it's

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,260
doing a lot of work is done around this

00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:53,880
in and the human-computer interfaces and

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:56,839
in human interaction so the way that

00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:58,649
those groups of people talk about

00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,499
complexity is called cognitive

00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:04,929
complexity in a HDI derision

00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:07,299
this is studied and what it is is this

00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,159
literally the study of cognitive loading

00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,229
using a system that's what they mean by

00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:13,029
complexity the higher the cognitive load

00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:15,459
is the more complexities in other words

00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,859
the system is required you to think a

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,569
lot which means it's more complex so

00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:21,579
this is another version of complexity

00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:23,849
both of them have something to do with

00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:27,039
the fact that there's a lot of parts and

00:10:23,849 --> 00:10:31,959
it's hard to think about those parts

00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:34,779
right there's another issue of

00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:37,659
complexity that is much more less it

00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:41,979
also got kind of cognition thinking but

00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:44,969
it is less about kind of infinite God

00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:47,409
looking at a object or an interface

00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:53,319
wicked problems and this is more from

00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:56,259
the kind of social sciences to course

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:57,819
will came up with this idea and he's I

00:10:56,259 --> 00:11:00,129
get wicked problems as roughly that

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,259
whenever we look at a problem the first

00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:04,029
thing we try to do if we're taking a

00:11:02,259 --> 00:11:06,399
science frame of mind is we try to

00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:08,139
untangle the problem in final tarts as

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,499
all all the individual parts right as

00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:14,079
this is the way that science attempts to

00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:16,329
solve many problems so for riddle he's

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,069
saying in social systems one of the

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:20,319
problems is literally just can't take

00:11:18,069 --> 00:11:22,509
the system apart you can't find the

00:11:20,319 --> 00:11:25,269
edges well enough to actually define

00:11:22,509 --> 00:11:27,399
them as being separate so if you've ever

00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:28,779
done any systems thinking and you've

00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:30,999
ever had an argument with someone who

00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:33,039
does the turtles all the way down move

00:11:30,999 --> 00:11:35,649
on you of infinite regress where they

00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,679
you say the boundary of the system is

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:42,279
here and they say why and then also the

00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:43,839
system is the universe right um this is

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:46,720
the wicked problem this is the problem

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,519
that you can't you in order to think in

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,069
systems thinking you need to have

00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:52,809
basically an agreement to play fair

00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:55,509
right if you have time in agreement that

00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:59,009
we can have boundaries right so when a

00:11:55,509 --> 00:12:00,800
problem is that that that can't happen

00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:03,620
deterministic right

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:06,110
can't to turn is to say here's the way

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,970
the social system is bounded right and

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,580
there's all sorts of interesting issues

00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:12,740
with that literature Arros the problems

00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:15,459
with identity and complex systems is

00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,779
excellent paper on that I love it so

00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:21,640
that we kind of move on to kind of the

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:23,450
more towards mark purchases ideas

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,310
cybernetics general Systems Theory

00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:29,360
information theory and turret turing

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:32,260
machines right so Norbert Wiener comes

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,839
up with this idea the cybernetics

00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:38,990
generally you have a thermostat feedback

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,420
loop yay you can do all things right um

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,250
and so this feedback loop is part of

00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,050
complexity right like the system is

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:47,690
feeding back on itself becomes more more

00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:49,220
complex in some ways then we get general

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,230
Systems Theory which I just briefly

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,810
described and then two other ones that

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,209
are quite interested in our interrelated

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,399
or information during turning both of

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,850
which have ways of thinking about

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,990
complexity right so one way you could

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:06,920
mathematically determine the complexity

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,380
of something is the cost in turning time

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,560
of solving that problem right so the

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,589
longer it takes to solve a problem the

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,790
more computational complexity is yes so

00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:20,899
that's one way of measuring it

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:22,910
information theory the more complex a

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:27,950
message that you can send through a

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:30,890
particular system the has to do with

00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:32,870
whether or not the system has enough

00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:36,140
variability in it to actually send

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:38,240
messages also interesting play with I

00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,519
have the same slide price isn't that

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,259
exciting but

00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:46,739
finally we're not final but getting

00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:50,699
there but after this in the 70s we get

00:13:46,739 --> 00:13:54,239
the concept of chaos theory so chaos

00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:58,859
theory Lorenz and Mandelbrot this is a

00:13:54,239 --> 00:14:00,239
behind you is the Lorenz butterfly the

00:13:58,859 --> 00:14:01,799
Lorenz butterfly you should kind of

00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:03,509
think of like that pendulum that I

00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,779
started with it's the same kind of idea

00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:08,729
right there there's a pattern here right

00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:11,369
it seems to be moving in the general

00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:14,159
shape of a butterfly but each path is

00:14:11,369 --> 00:14:18,809
unique and it is non-deterministic in

00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,579
itself um Lorenz notice this very

00:14:18,809 --> 00:14:23,159
strange thing what he was playing with

00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:25,679
systems so they don't know what the law

00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:29,059
of large numbers is law of large numbers

00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:31,349
says if I'm looking at a star from Earth

00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:33,989
my trying to figure out what it where it

00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:35,579
is in the sky the best way to figure out

00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:38,129
where it is is to have multiple

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:42,569
reference points right and the averages

00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:45,029
cause bit more accuracy right so this is

00:14:42,569 --> 00:14:46,769
generally the way that science thinks

00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:48,869
about most things or did before

00:14:46,769 --> 00:14:51,479
complexity theory which was if you start

00:14:48,869 --> 00:14:53,489
with a small variation of different

00:14:51,479 --> 00:14:56,759
numbers eventually they'll average out

00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:58,470
and give you the right now so we always

00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,779
think of kind of converging at this

00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,279
point well the right is noticed was he

00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:03,989
could do certain things with certain

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,059
types of systems there Obama linear

00:15:03,989 --> 00:15:08,399
systems where they would diverge instead

00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:11,429
of converge even the smallest starting

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,189
parameters so this is called high

00:15:11,429 --> 00:15:16,649
sensitivity to initial conditions and

00:15:14,189 --> 00:15:19,439
this is what causes what they call

00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:23,869
deterministic chaotic systems which are

00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:27,199
also an interesting form of complexity

00:15:23,869 --> 00:15:29,399
finally two more and then we can move on

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:35,749
ecological and natural biological

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:39,919
systems there we so we've done kind of

00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:43,160
computation human user interface

00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,259
computational complexity

00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,029
and social complexity this is another

00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:49,180
form of complexity that you've talked in

00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,069
a lot you'll notice the language

00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,100
probably you've seen this language in if

00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:57,589
you've done any agile II things this

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,230
comes from my old gist try to apply

00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:02,120
these ideas and the ideas that kind of

00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,550
pop up in this community are self

00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:06,920
organizational model Cui's is adaptation

00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,639
and emergence a lot of these ideas

00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:12,620
actually slide their way into the

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,019
pattern language book which then becomes

00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:18,680
maybe the initiative on one of the

00:16:15,019 --> 00:16:22,399
original Bibles for architects both in

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:25,040
software and architect architect es so

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:30,220
all of these ideas also complex-- the

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,750
ideas finally we get founded rational

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:38,120
bounded rationality and computational

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:40,329
complexity so perfect climate define

00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:43,279
battled in rationality is the idea that

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:44,810
okay if we are looking at that Whittle

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,509
ish systems so if we're looking at

00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:49,850
wicked systems and we can't disentangle

00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:52,279
them we still have to make decisions so

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:53,630
we're bounded in the amount of time and

00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:55,399
information we can extract from that

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,980
system so we're just going to have to

00:16:55,399 --> 00:17:02,300
satisfy right we just have to make a

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:04,640
reasonably good decision and this

00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:06,319
encourages because it's about kind of a

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,270
temporal concept right in other words

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,370
you only have a certain amount of time

00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:12,380
to make a good decision it becomes a

00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:14,929
race to make faster and faster computers

00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:16,490
because if you can make the computer go

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:19,069
faster and you can feed the information

00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,860
into the computer then you can actually

00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:23,809
solve more complex problems right and so

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,799
computational complexity ends up being

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,380
looking like a big blue beating a chess

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:34,179
master right that is what this form of

00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:36,890
complexity is computation complexity um

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:38,270
also a different kind of complexity than

00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,350
for instance the wicked problems

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:46,180
complexity or the social complexity

00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:48,360
so in the end of all that there's a

00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:51,430
contagious for actual nature to the

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,160
dialectics of complexity the definition

00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:56,380
of complexity remains highly contentious

00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,020
there are multiple scientific attempts

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:02,170
to qualify plexi on the amount of

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:06,070
complexity system you can see social

00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,470
science design biology all interacting

00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:10,380
and trying to define in different ways

00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:12,940
concept of agency self-similarity

00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,500
creativity evolution ecosystems are all

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,390
engaged by both naturalist and

00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,830
complexity theorists and additionally

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:20,740
complexity is taken up by researchers of

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:24,210
cognition l'ouest Ock's and active which

00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:27,010
echo the computational and episodic ille

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:29,470
approaches to complexity divide both by

00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:34,600
pure sizes and like lockers in other

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:36,850
words too big mess right don't think if

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,620
you guys want to help me you can go here

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,360
this is a live document you can comment

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:43,600
on it all the stuff I just said is in

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:49,660
that document please feel free to go and

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:51,310
help you disentangle is some more so how

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:54,040
do you like work with any of these ideas

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:55,540
like what what what what do we do when

00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:00,010
we talk to people like that complexity

00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:02,800
of make complexity useful right um the

00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:05,530
first thing is that things are not just

00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,670
intertwined and like a pile of sand okay

00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:09,520
there's a difference between an

00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:11,530
aggregation and a system alright so an

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,590
aggregation is just a pile of things a

00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:17,590
system is something that gets more value

00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:19,330
because it's together right so one of

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:23,140
these can say about teens or people

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,820
initially is that an aggregate concept

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,060
of humans would be to say you're all

00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:30,550
little computers right and I put on a

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,730
team so I have more computing power on

00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:36,100
the bottom problem right that that would

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,950
be an aggregation right a system would

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,020
be to say you're not really computers

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,490
you all are working together and in fact

00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,580
as a team you are able to achieve

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:47,039
something you would not be able to

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,950
you by yourself but not just more

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,320
computational power but actual a

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:55,260
different kind of thinking right and so

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,330
in this way what you do is your team

00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,210
when you take a complexity friend and

00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:02,309
why is that you make mean together by

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,330
interacting together that's what you're

00:20:02,309 --> 00:20:09,559
doing as a team right and this making

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:12,929
meaning is what we call sense making oh

00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:15,799
and just to flip right back to the

00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:18,830
beginning this is kaerios right this is

00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:28,230
knowledge at particular moment in time

00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:30,450
right so but Brenda Durbin talks about

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,740
this part of it and when we try to make

00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:33,360
sense of things this is these are the

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,159
types of professionals we're trying to

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,010
answer right we're trying how we make

00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:40,080
sense of the world to acting it what

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:44,399
process do people use to give meaning to

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:48,000
experience how is actually for informed

00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:51,659
by what emerges from the constraints of

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,539
the system so this is Durbin this model

00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:57,539
of sense making she basically says that

00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:59,909
when you approach a situation that has a

00:20:57,539 --> 00:21:03,059
lot of complexity in it I have to figure

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:05,429
out how to understand this you are in a

00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:08,779
situation with the history it has a past

00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:12,330
right you're not coming into it like a

00:21:08,779 --> 00:21:14,490
cpu waiting for instructions you will

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:19,860
have some way of thinking about how you

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:21,870
got there and have some goal and you try

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,020
make a bridge by making ideas and

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:25,970
cognition

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,700
and the bridge is over a gap about

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,950
confusions and rills and when you're

00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,470
angsty about and this is what she calls

00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:40,030
since mating I also loved it clearly she

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:43,820
made this in mspaint the famous spy ring

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:48,860
think it's awesome so who knows what

00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:51,679
this is oh boy okay alright so this is

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,740
what we call kinetic kinetic is a wealth

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,450
word here's the trick condemning uses

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,910
three words that most people use to mean

00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,200
the same thing so I will ask you not to

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,790
spend too much time thing about the

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,559
words I'm going to give you experiential

00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:08,720
versions of them can Devon means the

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,190
place of my multiple belongings which is

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,960
a terrible definition it's a Wells word

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,910
what what what I the way I describe it

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,320
is if you go back home you go to high

00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,480
school where you went high school and

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,580
you kind of get near high school and you

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,140
feel like a pressure on your chest and

00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,360
you feel like the rules are changing

00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,960
like oh wait like I should act

00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,360
differently right now right so it is a

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:35,150
geographically bounded role that you

00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,549
feel right that is literally muttaqun

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,500
evidence it's a space in which you feel

00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:41,570
like the rules have changed one other

00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:43,160
ways you can experience it that's a

00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:46,190
little bit less powerful i think but

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:47,840
just I when I come to work I feel like I

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,370
should act sunlight and want to go home

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,860
I feel like I should act some way and

00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:53,840
that feel like I act differently in both

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,799
those places right that's that is what I

00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:01,340
can evan is so the kinetic model it

00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:05,600
helps to explain some ways that feel so

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:08,630
make sense sense of the world right now

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:12,650
the first is it ordered vs unordered but

00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:13,299
there's on the left-hand side left

00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:18,519
enzyme

00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:20,259
left right order ordered is the way most

00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,809
people think about the world it is cause

00:23:20,259 --> 00:23:24,789
and effect it is if I do this I expect

00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:29,230
this result and I expected to happen

00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:31,450
repeatedly right so our order is I don't

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:33,789
really know what will happen if I do

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:35,529
this I'm going to poke the system but

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:37,570
I'm not sure what's going to happen and

00:23:35,529 --> 00:23:39,009
not only that but sometimes when I

00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:45,700
poking it doesn't do the same thing

00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:48,340
again yes order unordered simple also

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:50,169
called audience so when you think about

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,309
this domain when you think about what

00:23:50,169 --> 00:23:56,919
this feels like in your head you think

00:23:53,309 --> 00:24:00,609
calling comcast because your mother is

00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,659
down and they run you through a script

00:24:00,609 --> 00:24:07,330
and you say to them on the phone

00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:11,830
repeatedly I know it's not that and they

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:13,859
refuse to go off script yes I love

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:17,169
plucked it yes totally did that right

00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:20,799
but that is the sensation of simplistic

00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:23,980
since simple or obvious right someone

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,259
believes that they have created a script

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,379
that will answer any question it's

00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:31,570
completely mechanistic right they are

00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:34,529
actually turning humans into little

00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:40,450
machine needs down here right um

00:24:34,529 --> 00:24:45,159
complicated complicated feels like when

00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:48,369
I have look at my honda engine and it's

00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:51,759
sealed and I ensure that someone can fix

00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:54,070
that engine but I'm sure I can't but

00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,230
that's that is feeling of complicated is

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,759
this this feeling like I know there is

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,369
an answer to this i know somebody

00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,139
understands it I don't I just need to

00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:05,919
find my person to understand it that's

00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:08,879
complicated okay classic things that

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,889
happen here is simple have very short

00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:15,120
causing effect boundaries complicated

00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:16,950
gets longer things like jet engines or

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,080
we felt like it to me they look really

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,750
complex right because I no idea how they

00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,510
were however they deliver people all of

00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:26,700
the planet very very regularly right so

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:31,380
they're in fact highly interested yeah I

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:33,809
have a question go Yusei engine is that

00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:37,530
complex because you can understand how

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:39,120
did it that's how does it mean that it

00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,130
doesn't fall into the complicated

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,740
category for someone to voice that's

00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:46,080
right so this is this is a semantic

00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,570
Horsell yeah Jeff so he's asking it

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,850
would the engineer think other that's

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:52,980
being complicated problem yeah but but

00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,929
then but then you realize it that too

00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,760
because in effect like Jane left and

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,580
practical effect chain length is the

00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,360
same whoever looks at it right yeah so

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,830
yes the cost effect chain would

00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:07,020
generally what it answer is that even if

00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:08,820
you go someone who really knows this hey

00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,559
they will tend to think it is more

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,970
obvious right because they will have lot

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,010
of experience with it but they will

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,470
likely have to do some analysis right

00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:18,510
they'll go oh these are the possible

00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:20,580
problems and i'm going to determine

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:21,480
exactly which one of these it is but i'm

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,040
going to have to look at your aunt's

00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,410
room for a little while right is that

00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:27,600
like a bicycle chain just what we use

00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:30,860
down here like your bring rice get into

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,860
it do the change mom

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:40,280
and how'd you like first I'll never

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:43,710
liked it so it is a it tends to be a

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:45,840
unique ontological epistemological turn

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:47,700
yes so it is a way that you know about

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,430
things and often especially at software

00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,170
engineering different people will be

00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:54,090
indifferent to make the same time is one

00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,580
of the problems happens some people will

00:26:54,090 --> 00:27:04,140
literally say either a I would like this

00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:06,240
to be treated as simple and as opposed

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,860
to some people Roy well no this is this

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,630
could be really complex which I'll

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:11,010
surely that's right so like they're one

00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,780
of the negotiations that often happens

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:14,580
in teams when you're using a lot like

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,190
this is which the more we operate

00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,380
anywhere like maybe the right way to the

00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,590
credit in relation to be causing the

00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,780
exchange Webbie that's when someone that

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:27,330
said something better they change thank

00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:28,890
you like compact because they see things

00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:31,200
that's something that would be a long

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,270
time for someone else as a single take

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,670
yeah absolutely so one of the ways of

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:37,890
measuring I think especially in the

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,810
software development and operations that

00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,750
we do say anything that causes the

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,730
temporalities shrink or allows us to

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,790
link causal effect better one of those

00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,800
two makes it more obvious yes and that's

00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:54,300
good in general especially for life

00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:58,920
anybody messes like 99 s or something um

00:27:54,300 --> 00:28:02,370
complex so the sensation of complex is

00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:04,590
this on the tip of my tongue right like

00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:07,050
if I can almost get I can't quite get it

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:10,530
but it's I know that if I think long I'm

00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:12,270
going to get right so the sense of it is

00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:15,060
that not that you don't know what's

00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:18,000
happening is that you kind of know what

00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:21,570
happened then I sense so complexity is

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,580
emergent write something if you think

00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,030
about it long enough something is going

00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,530
to emerge right and that is that is what

00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,960
complex--

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:33,230
it's deals like that I find that's more

00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,150
time I'm going to figure it out so yep

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,460
but complexity itself is all subjective

00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,750
is what you're saying based on all for

00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,640
these kinds of theories that regardless

00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:46,640
what will be complex to one person say

00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,170
in software engineer may be old hat yeah

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,570
so there's two ways of looking at this

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,490
one yes multiple people might think

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:55,820
different things are complex right here

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:57,950
so I'm not very good at crossword

00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:00,050
puzzles somebody else might be I might

00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:02,090
think a lot of words are coming I almost

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:03,800
got it I can't quit right I would think

00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,530
it's complex other people will be like I

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:08,540
saw that in 10 minutes so there's

00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:10,220
there's there is that the other thing

00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:12,230
that you want to do with this model is

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,720
basically figure out where is a team do

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,250
you want to operate literally do you

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,080
want to treat this like it's a complex

00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:20,450
problem do you want to treat this like

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,210
we don't quite know what the answer is

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,830
we should explore some more or do you

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,350
want to treat it like a complicated

00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:29,300
problem we have a list of what the

00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:31,190
problems could be we need to analyze it

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,230
and we'll give you a schedule for doing

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:35,090
that and be done you ought to worry

00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,190
about it go ahead but the differences

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,960
between these things are significant and

00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:44,350
that's what we're trying to kind of get

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:49,190
people to think about ki so chaotic is

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:51,470
every space movie when they the

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:53,210
astronaut gets blasted out as floating

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:55,670
in space and they're reaching and trying

00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:58,250
to grab onto something yes that is what

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:00,650
chaotic feels like because chaotic is

00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,560
the lack of connections that's what it

00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:06,380
is I can't actually get purchase on

00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,750
anything to move in any direction so the

00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:10,670
feeling of chaos and it kind of

00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,840
epistemological you know as you're

00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:19,040
thinking is I can't get a grip on it yes

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:20,420
so there are four teams because I think

00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,240
this is useful for developing people

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:26,240
there are these Lakes you can look at

00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:29,190
this this is a simple complicated

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,480
complex and chaotic

00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:36,900
in a chaotic system first don't do this

00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:38,790
in general but none of the actors are

00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,950
interacting with each other right so

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:42,960
literally the dotted line means they've

00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:45,330
not strongly connected anywhere so

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:47,280
chaotic team feels like they'll be

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,630
talking to each other for feels like

00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,040
nobody can talk to each other because

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,060
they don't have the right language yet

00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:55,290
to talk to each other that's what

00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:57,620
chaotic till it feels like an order team

00:30:55,290 --> 00:31:04,910
has two different ways of operating

00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:08,250
obvious is the Boston or the manual says

00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:10,440
what to do to the people right so it

00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,240
says just do this and this problem will

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,670
be solved and you'll note that people

00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,810
don't talk to each other right because

00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,700
there's no reason to talk because

00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:20,720
there's already an answer right this is

00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,340
also highly problematic it causes that

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,200
that live it literally says to people

00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:29,190
don't think and that's bad in general

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,700
telling people not to think it's a bad

00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:34,560
idea but complicated this is a bunch of

00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,410
experts who have their own language

00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,020
together and also doesn't share that

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,700
language but has an impassable so he can

00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,770
go to the experts to say hey this is

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,110
what I want to get done so he's in

00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,690
control a little bit but he's not

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:52,950
telling them the exactly if it again and

00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:56,700
finally complex complexes where the boss

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:59,580
man goes to a group of highly connected

00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,250
experts and and really loosened the

00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:04,350
reins and says generally I want you to

00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,890
explore over there in that area but I

00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:10,260
have no solution yet often this is used

00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:12,630
the way you do this is this guy state a

00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:14,370
problem and it says nothing about what

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:17,280
the solution let me just this is a

00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:22,840
problem you guys go fix it however you

00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:26,110
want yes um alright so

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:31,660
here are the very quick end versions of

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:33,970
this the way to do complex work is to

00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,670
have everyone retain frills within

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:39,010
specific boundaries constraint people

00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:41,710
appropriately the way you can tell if

00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:43,720
it's working or not is run overly

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,360
unconstrained team stop acting because

00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,820
they don't feel safe there's not enough

00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,020
kind of constraint to make them move

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:54,610
right over constrain teams stop acting

00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,010
because they can't figure out which

00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:58,960
rules to follow they're going to get

00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,920
screwed one way or another because

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,550
they're going to have to break some

00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,110
rules right that's over constrain the

00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,520
different domains so there was

00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,930
eventually those different feelings

00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:12,730
require different ways of knowing

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:15,100
context matters and good leaders are

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:19,660
capable will figure out what the main

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:22,060
they want the team to operate it be

00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,400
where it complexity bias or complexity

00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,770
fetishism right so like complexity is

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,420
just one of the domains you don't always

00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:31,500
want to operate in complexity it's

00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:33,430
incredibly expensive to be in complexity

00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,820
you don't want to stay there where you

00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:39,640
will starve to death best practices are

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:41,610
by definition past practice right so you

00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:44,560
actually want to move stuff out of

00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,230
obvious and into complicated and complex

00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:52,180
in order to rejuvenate it there was a

00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:54,100
while new new knowledge requires

00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:57,190
reexamination of current constraints so

00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:59,020
literally trying to figure out what the

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,460
team is reacting to and changing those

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:04,480
constraints is how you actually create

00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:06,330
new knowledge all technology only brings

00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,610
benefits if you can identify which

00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:14,560
limitations remove from the system which

00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:18,280
constraints it removes and finally this

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,680
nice little message for mrs. how the

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,930
message of all this is unambiguously

00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,330
clear if you want to tame the blurs

00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:28,450
right you're not learning to have

00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:31,540
learning is a process with a history and

00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:35,260
future it is thus not containable within

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:37,360
observable moments single point metrics

00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:39,670
and thinking about you know what's

00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:41,640
happening right now as opposed to what

00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:58,570
just happening what we want to happen

00:34:41,640 --> 00:35:00,840
cause significant problems I know enough

00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:03,730
about Kevin asks different questions

00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,100
excellent um but I think at two points

00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:08,290
you kind of alluded to the chaotic or

00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:10,300
acting first and I think that last eight

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:12,280
yes it is a bad thing done any

00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:15,430
operational I think that's kind of wrong

00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:16,660
but because like things like we get into

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,400
about what we know we need to kill

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,500
something yeah and that's chaotic right

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,450
yeah its heart it's about practice yeah

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,190
when a practice we don't have a clear

00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,720
definition there that practice we need

00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,750
to figure out what quadrant we're in

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,030
yeah and so I think I didn't think it'd

00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,740
are like your you'll be saying like from

00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:34,570
a software development process maybe but

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:37,000
for now the regional perspective I kind

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:39,190
of like the idea of knowing when things

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,410
account and we have a lot of history and

00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,450
operations up yeah circuit breaker

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:44,710
matter let me go on and off that so the

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,570
way that I generally describes so

00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,160
there's two versions of chaos so this is

00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,500
contentious even within academic

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,570
community and one that I described is

00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,670
one you never want to approach which is

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,560
being completely out of people right you

00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,420
just don't want to get there there are

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:01,120
shallow dips in the chaos which are ways

00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:03,400
of like motivating change in thinking as

00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:06,610
a manager the way that I try to describe

00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:09,040
chaos versus the other ones is one

00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,930
managers have a gun and they can kill

00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,310
things and they should never tell things

00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:13,750
unless they're in the chaotic zone in

00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:15,610
which case exactly the way you're

00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:16,450
describing it and really what it is is

00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:19,150
an attempt

00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:23,530
to think how to limit their use of guns

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:26,200
the only tales and that's really that's

00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,940
what I think the key it is because in

00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,839
all the other ones they should actually

00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,520
be making sure their guns hold limiting

00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:35,500
I think again in an operation sector I

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,260
think there's a beauty and understanding

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:41,410
that you be gone that's not by them so

00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:43,570
anything probably so you don't live in I

00:36:41,410 --> 00:36:46,119
think I think we just need to understand

00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:48,369
the package yep so at some point i'll

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:50,109
show you the what we call the authentic

00:36:48,369 --> 00:36:54,900
versions and then that will answer your

00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:54,900
