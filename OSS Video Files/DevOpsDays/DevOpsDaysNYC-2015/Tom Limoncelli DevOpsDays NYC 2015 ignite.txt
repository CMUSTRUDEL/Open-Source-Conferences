right next up we have s re well x

00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,770
dissident and author of several books

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,360
including the cloud over my personal

00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,969
favorite is kept me from ripping out my

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:19,830
hair so defines time management for

00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:22,380
system administrators Tom Lee Miceli hi

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,150
I'm going to talk about you can't get or

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,900
give empathy when people can't see what

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:30,510
you're talking about and this is a story

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,460
about a project that first of all as a

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,130
slimmer it's something i did at a

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,850
previous employer employer / being

00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,950
nameless and so I can't take credit for

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:44,070
it was everything was a big team

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,079
actually I came in at the end I did

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:50,100
mostly a lot of the validating of the

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,250
process and stuff um but this is a story

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,550
about a oh no I have another thing I

00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:58,320
want to say DevOps is not see I and so I

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,930
couch myself to come up with a story

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,760
that is step-ups without talking about

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,010
just software development you're putting

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,170
things into production so this is the

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,299
opposite this is a very physical process

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,460
the process of opening new offices

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,799
actually the process of running network

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,869
services to new offices I was working at

00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,840
this company we were opening lots of

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:21,330
options constantly and the process for

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:25,490
just this network portion that Mikey was

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:30,630
involved in 30 linear steps it was crazy

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:32,579
and in all 12 teams to get it done Mikey

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,250
me was involved with most of the steps

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:36,720
so we kind of owned the process but we

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,390
were treating these other teams as black

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,430
boxes so if we need a 9 feet of range of

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,369
IP blocks we asked the network if we

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,360
needed a building code allocated we ask

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,829
the real safety and why were we doing it

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,540
this way well just kind of evolved that

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:53,369
way and it was easier to treat these

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:56,130
other teams as flat boxes than to

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,799
collaborate I mean that's that boss

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,210
talking to people as a result our

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,220
process was highly variable sometimes

00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:04,810
took us a month to do what we were doing

00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,850
for building sometimes three months and

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,410
worst of all we couldn't predict which

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,819
of those buildings would be the one

00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,770
month or certain way from people three

00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:13,750
mothers so we started mapping our

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,480
dependency what are these 30 steps that

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,790
we're doing and it took six months to of

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,430
meetings to figure out what is this

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,280
actual process and we found undocumented

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:26,110
steps but for the first time we had

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,850
everything that I've been to be put in a

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:31,060
machine-readable format we created this

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:32,440
stuff I my file essentially that we

00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,650
could edit we could keep under source

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,110
code control it encoded more than just

00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:41,019
appendices it had ownership for various

00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,150
steps i'm a big deadline so horny so we

00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,040
knew yours we thought we might be so

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,580
good but after we documented it and

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,900
worked out the process then we do and we

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,090
figured out why it's because this is

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,739
involved 12 teams and 30 steps we really

00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,860
didn't even know the size of the problem

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:59,050
we were dealing with so we stepped in we

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:03,519
started meeting with these other 11

00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:04,840
teams the manager commander was good but

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,650
really what was important was when we

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:12,489
flow flew to meet them and make met team

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,680
on here and we asked three creeks three

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,390
important questions well our piece

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:18,700
dependencies after we showed them these

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,760
we printed out the map on this to your

00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,290
paper yes it is our API correct how are

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,019
we asking for these things are we asking

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:28,720
it in a way that makes sense and what

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:31,480
pain are we causing you or what pain can

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,280
you resolve for us three reactions

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,959
minute most of the teams didn't even

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,579
know they were part of the process right

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,209
they were just getting these tickets and

00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:42,940
responding to them response to could you

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,620
phrase your request differently asking

00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:46,000
for a trap but we deal with pebbles

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,530
bricks and boulders and every time we

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,960
get a ticket we have no idea what you're

00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,360
talking about

00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,780
kind of guess guess and that's why

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,150
things are so messed up and then we talk

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,850
about our dependencies and yoga pensee

00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,160
is missing it makes them delay if

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:03,920
there's unneeded dependencies means

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,750
we're delaying and asking them so the

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,470
process was getting much better defined

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,700
much more viewable oh and as we were

00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:13,670
having these meetings we were editing

00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:15,620
the ini file in real time and generating

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,570
this rack so Ethan they're seeing how

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,090
the process was getting better during

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,340
these conversations this is so much

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,810
better than taking notes at the meeting

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,330
and then coming back to them a week

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,180
later with the new diagram machine

00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,250
encoded dependencies meant we could

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,260
write unit tests which right tools so we

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,230
started detecting widows and orphans in

00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:38,780
the process and if we updated the

00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:42,620
process and added an orphan we were told

00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:45,160
needed we were able to write tools that

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,410
augmented the project managers test so

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,840
brainy asleep they were having this

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,780
portable manual process now that they

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,460
were at dashboard essentially and that

00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,490
dashboard grew and grew and grew and

00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,050
eventually it became a general purpose

00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,880
dashboard for a lot of different

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,580
processes we for the first time ever

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,260
masters could look at that board just

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,570
know who's blocking who who's lacking

00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,840
and we for first time ever and start

00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:14,480
predicting completion time so this

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,690
machine via coded process let us have

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:19,850
tools and artifacts and as a result we

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:21,830
could stop through other teams of splat

00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:24,070
boxes and they'll stop treating you the

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,070
same way

00:05:26,969 --> 00:05:29,029
