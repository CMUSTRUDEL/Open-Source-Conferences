thoughts at devastates New York 2013 I

had awesome hair she's not part of a

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,100
conspiracy of paper thought leaders

00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,930
because that is not a real thing it does

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,719
not exist Sarah there's definitely no

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:09,299

very excited when phantom prepared the I

get your name right all right well

00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:26,040
anyway I think her name was hot proposed

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,320
the remote ops work open space yesterday

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,420

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,220
top I did go back after they have to her

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,909

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:41,310
but basically yeah i'm going to talk

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,390
about the doing the remote work thing in

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:47,729
a DevOps sort of way um you'll be graded

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:49,890
have turned on my whistle audio-visual

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,659
investors it's really not that bad this

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,430
time I just forgot to turn it off so

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:55,259
when my Bridget creme up Catherine

00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,840
already introduced me so probably know

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,790
most of this stuff probably the one

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,710
thing that we didn't talk about was I do

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,290
co-host podcast so you can go check out

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,340
arrested dev ops com if you want to see

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,500
people like Catherine and

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,300
Jason and C are showing up on there from

00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:15,459
time to time and yeah you can find me on

00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,410
the twitters if you've been following

00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:19,959
the DevOps to a hashtag really noticed

00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,129
that I had like the twinners so you may

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,200
have been pretty sure my co-workers all

00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:26,349
of you my conference hashtags during the

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,910
conference but so yeah we're going to

00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,670
place called DramaFever we're a

00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,640
streaming video platform really but we

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,920
started out as a streaming video website

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,560
first first episode of the first show

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,940
like episode 1 or you know show one in

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,590
the drop favorite databases coffee

00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:44,860
prince because we started out just

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,260
dreaming kdramas Korean dramas and we've

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:50,140
expanded to a lot of other countries and

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,540
a lot of other you know languages we

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:55,090
subtitle at all and most of our customer

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,980
base is in the North American market so

00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,660
from an operative view we don't

00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:01,599
necessarily need to do a follow the Sun

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,129
thing in terms of like you know my

00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,860
support or whatever since most of our

00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:07,780
customer base is in you know barely

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:11,950
north and south american band of the

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:14,560
globe but we do actually also run a

00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:17,739
video platform now so we run a couple of

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:21,010
sites for AMC and that we're the

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,359
sundance documentary site and shelter is

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,690
a horror site that we have coming online

00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:28,660
sometime the next month i think and so

00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:32,019
at that point you when you go from like

00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:34,480
single site to multi-site you definitely

00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:38,290
want to hire more people and who here

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,389
works some place that's hiring yeah it's

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,549
almost the entire room raises the pan

00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:44,650
and you might find that you can't find

00:03:42,549 --> 00:03:47,440
people to hire in your local market if

00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,620
you can't if you have the ability to

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,419
hire people who maybe live outside of a

00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,239
limited geographic area they may have

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,769
housing density problems or maybe super

00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:58,120
expensive to live in you might be able

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:00,069
to hire more people so it's just a good

00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,419
strategy if you can make it work but a

00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,250
lot of organizations think will help we

00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:04,900
possibly make that work and only an open

00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:07,269
space yes yesterday a bunch of people

00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,919
said they wish that they could be in a

00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:10,739
remote friendly environment but the

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,389
company doesn't know how to make it work

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,680
so if we have not going to go into a lot

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,269
of detail on our staff this isn't that

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,519
talk but we have all of the you know dr.

00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,560
goodness and what that a you know a

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:29,729
bunch of live didn't put his talk and

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:32,970
worsen talker but we also have an office

00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,560
in New York our main office it's

00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,849
actually not one to the tech team as

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,550
most of the tech team was in Philly but

00:04:35,849 --> 00:04:41,340
our main office is at 72 Madison Avenue

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,020
and it's a wonderful space and if I

00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,150
wanted to go work there I could I could

00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,440
walk over there really easily now if I

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,470
wanted to walk over there from where

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:50,550
actually live in Minneapolis of google

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,960
maps tells me it would take three

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,310
hundred and sixty five hours which

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,599
sounds like a really long commute I

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,970
don't know about you not really into

00:04:54,599 --> 00:05:01,500
community so don't actually want to do

00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:03,930
that um and so not having to go into the

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,220
office becomes really valuable if you

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:07,949
would like to work someplace that is

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,090
nowhere near your own all right live

00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:11,219
supply system where you're in your

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,750
office um we do have co-working spaces

00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:15,090
in Minneapolis this ones in the gold

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,190
Grain Exchange it's a uniform foot

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:18,479
ceilings and wood floors and it's a

00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:20,190
really fantastic space i go there

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,710
approximately one day week depending on

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,229
whether or not in town I work out of

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:26,759
coffee shops a lot the guy on the far

00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,930
end is looking at me he was like this is

00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,099
going to end up on YouTube and I was

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:34,919
like no you're not starting at a video

00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:36,840
I'm working at home a lot and it's it's

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,520
amazing how your cat ends up deciding

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,279
exactly where to hang out when you're

00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,779
setting a working in the couch NSYNC

00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,159
okay how does this work that sounds like

00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:47,340
you just hang out a lot of places how do

00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:50,130
you actually work so whether or not I'm

00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:51,900
in any of those places or not pictured

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:54,000
airplane the gogo inflight Wi-Fi is

00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,729
terrible sort of work but it's mostly

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,360
terrible but what work looks like is

00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:02,310
it's in slack it's in github issues and

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,110
pull requests st. Google Hangouts

00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:06,690
usually scheduled but sometimes ad hoc

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,190
and we do use a lot of doctor and that's

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:10,699
the less mention a doctor but we do use

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,130
a lot of that is it's really nice for

00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,630
basically a lot of consistency there's

00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,759
literally I don't think I've ever burden

00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:20,190
well it's very rare to hear somebody say

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,229
works on my machine it's like everyone's

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:23,219
pulling the same container so we at

00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:25,020
least have that kind of consistency

00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:26,279
where you don't necessarily need to go

00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,639
over to someone's machine to try to

00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,560
figure out what's going on

00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,030
not to say that you don't end up screen

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:37,419
sharing people sometimes to solve things

00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:38,650
but and I assume that because we are

00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:39,879
ahead to throw this picture in there

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,050
because we are right here by times

00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,189
square i didn't realize we're going to

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,379
be this tentative this close to times

00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:46,120
square for some reason google decided to

00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,129
advertise for us in Times Square all's

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,789
December is fantastic it's like don't

00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:54,099
take google pics but we don't usually

00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,020
put out information that way like how we

00:06:54,099 --> 00:06:59,409
actually disseminate information on our

00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:01,150
team is any kind of ad hoc discussion

00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:03,039
whether in person or Google hangout or

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,620
whatever that you have or in slack that

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:08,590
you have it makes it into the github

00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:10,509
issue or it didn't happen so the single

00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,539
source of truth that we were talking

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,490
about yesterday for US isn't github we

00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,930
do have teens that use like pivotal

00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,849
tracker for different things and you

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,009
know they use other things for very

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:23,860
specific projects but the single source

00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:26,110
of truth isn't get home and the single

00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,610
source of communication in that you're

00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,219
expected to be paying attention to of

00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,860
your at work is our tech channel and

00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:36,099
slack we have a lot of channels mean

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,589
that's not the only channel I love slack

00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:41,589
so everyone hyper go about it you need

00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:43,479
it but this is just a small sampling of

00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:45,279
our channels like we have an appt

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:46,750
specific channel but it's a public

00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,060
channel and anyone can be on that's

00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:50,589
important otherwise you end up with a

00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,300
private club house with like I mean find

00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:54,550
out door and then everyone is sad and

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,469
you don't want that virtual water

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:58,779
folders faces are pretty important in

00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:00,580
chat just because again if you're if you

00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,580
want to bond with team members that are

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,810
you know a 365 our walk away from you I

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,860
don't have a car so I have to measure

00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:08,319
things and how long it would take to

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,699
walk there Dellavedova thought a car

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,879
it's probably fine but uh but we even

00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:17,500
have on the sports channels it's the

00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:19,210
driver that held ralph was last night of

00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,069
think i've been out of it because was it

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,120
last night yeah that's right i was

00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,500
talking to Joe this morning running

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,210
through and talk and he was like Anna

00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,830
hush like a few already armed like a few

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,330
minutes of the draft fell asleep drank

00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:30,810
pick five and woke up during a 12 and

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:36,099
I'm like what what happened to my god

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:38,319
but uh we do actually like work we work

00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,740
on things actively in the chat channels

00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:41,930
so and

00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,849
you know cat like the cat assisting with

00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:45,560
the deploy to prod is an important part

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,480
of this complete deploy obviously

00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,800
because you know as my boss said you

00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,959
need to have two sets of eyes on

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:56,120
anything awesome um and it's it's pretty

00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:58,610
I think it's pretty helpful and

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,440
important to realize that like even

00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,050
though yeah I'm standing here in

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,610
Minneapolis this when not at the couch

00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:06,290
with McAdam and the standing desk the

00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,730
cat still wants to participate I don't

00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,310
know I think have to buy a tree put it

00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,830
next to the static baskets problem but

00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:14,600
uh but I don't feel horribly alone all

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,339
the time which is good because kind of

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,110
like Chris a very very extroverted I

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:19,940
really like people we don't want to be

00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,050
horribly alone the whole time I feel

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:23,000
like working remote would be very

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:24,470
difficult if I felt horribly I isolated

00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,680
all the time to go to a lot of

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:30,050
conferences both so but another thing is

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,290
when I mentioned github before we don't

00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:35,779
just use it for you know tasks and and

00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:37,880
we don't just use it for lower class of

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:39,470
code we actually keep our tech handbook

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,779
in there so we have a collaborative

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,540
culture where this is one of our

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:45,890
developers decided that the wording in

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:47,360
the tech handbook about what it was like

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:49,040
you take vacation I don't know if you

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,130
can read that back if you can read that

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,200
or not again ok so the wording of the

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,700
tech head broke about you know when you

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,430
would take vacation cleo is meant to be

00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,050
tongue-in-cheek but some employees were

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:01,790
feeling self-conscious or unhappy about

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,170
letting their co-workers down my

00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:06,050
schedule notification one of the

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,700
developers didn't you know go and find

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,770
out from a jar this would be ok you just

00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:12,800
submit it applause thing we change this

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:17,589
and you gotta looks good to me from a

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:20,120
couple of people and it went in so and

00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:21,440
that doesn't mean and I'm painting that

00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,089
rosy picture and it sounds like were

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,520
just like some sort of magical at sea

00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:29,000
buena park right there are you

00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,910
difference is sparkly horsham sports but

00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,410
we're not perfect and so like I am

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:35,120
pretty sure this was I can't remember

00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,770
exactly what happened back in February

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,510
pretty I'm pretty sure that this is me

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,310
subtweeting about something I work that

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:41,540
was stressing me out and also Django

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,800
cash machine because that's horrible

00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:45,829
right I mean everybody agrees that

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,470
that's horrible but on an asteroid

00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:49,970
acticin who is a engineering director at

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,770
Google she's going to be keynoting at

00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:54,140
velocity santa clara so you should go

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,250
she's amazing but she answered with what

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,920
something I thought was really profound

00:10:55,250 --> 00:11:00,410
which is southwest made feelings I mean

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,760
what's uppers made d bullets its

00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:06,850
software is our will like written you

00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:09,350
know it's our will made manifest to

00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:12,620
create I mean if it is sort of like

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,140
magic and it's very personal I mean you

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,050
can you could spot pleasure i skogen

00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:21,800
mile away because it it has style just

00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:23,209
like pros so it's I think it's really

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,620
important to remember that we're talking

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:26,480
about all this cool stuff we're talking

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,740
about stuff that people are using and

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,430
I'm going to have all the feels of how

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:33,430
and misunderstandings happen and I got

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,870
permission from my boss to include this

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,750
section of dance from our you know

00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,870
private messages on slab which was the

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,449
TLDR this is he put a comment on one of

00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,310
my github pull request that I have took

00:11:44,449 --> 00:11:48,860
really badly and thought that he was

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:50,600
being really unkind to me and I spent

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:52,279
half the day stewing over it which was

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,709
ridiculous because as soon as I talked

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:56,899
to him it became obvious that he was not

00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:59,930
in any way like trying to call me about

00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:02,120
her be more that's me that's like if I

00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:03,709
had taken the effort to kind of try to

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,690
communicate a little more there instead

00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,980
of and maybe if we had been in the same

00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,579
office it would have been easier because

00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:12,560
he will see me right but maybe not I

00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:15,890
mean people live cats can sometimes hide

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,270
that stuff so so yeah so thank you

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:18,620
making the effort to communicate about

00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:23,300
that sort of thing is even more

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:25,459
important when your room all but one

00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,529
thing that makes it easier is and this

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,329
is this is actually the blingle

00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,420
post-mortem link goes exactly where you

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:34,160
think it's going to go hey who know what

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:35,839
goes exactly where it goes it goes to

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,740
the photos craft Papa blog posts from

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:43,279
link 2012 and I didn't tell him to send

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:45,399
this out after we had a safe incident my

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,620
boss you know without me being like

00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,850
drinkin to have schooling or whatever

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,529
just sent an email to the company

00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,720
anything go by the way I just a windows

00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:54,680
are incident reports are here and this

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,560
is something that you should know about

00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:58,570
and I was like excellent

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,040
this is I know that you're not supposed

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,450
to car would call culture but there's a

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,029
few things from at sea than I finally

00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,950
just lifting cool skin feel like and one

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,860
of them is hey we have to focus on the

00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,510
problem and not on the person because

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,210
people are going to make mistakes the

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,029
failures in all parallel systems is all

00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:17,440
solid to it so I had some anything about

00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:20,670
Devin yet so for those of you who are

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:24,100
playing the bingo game thanks um

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:26,230
speaking of work the game I had really

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,450
bad attitude first quarter because we

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:31,089
implemented okay ours and we did them

00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:33,100
with like a Google spreadsheet and one

00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:34,900
scored them differently and I scored

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,700
really worthy because we were using a

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,200
very boolean sort of method and that

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,330
other groups were like we're just going

00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,460
to use smiley faces and you're like why

00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:43,870
shouldn't we do that and so this time

00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,279
we're actually using a tool from

00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,380
something that it's called better works

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,760
but the tool is not the important part

00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:51,070
the important part is that we're making

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,300
the progress that we're doing for things

00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,520
especially things other parts of the

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:56,290
organization really care about visible

00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:57,400
to other parts of the organization so I

00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,320
don't think it necessarily matter is

00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,760
what tool you use for it but the

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,839
important part is that if you have goals

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,580
that you're working towards that you're

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,070
communicating you know to the

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,230
organization about if they can actually

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,330
see so that the in case they missed it

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,580
like you're more looking at slac that

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,650
given day or maybe they're not a

00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,450
developer at all not sure what github is

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,010
and they're not sure why I developer

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,050
would want to be able to create a repo

00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,130
whatever that is at least that part of

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:22,630
the organization who doesn't know what

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,250
that stuff is can see that there's stuff

00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:27,100
happening that's providing better

00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:30,610
collaboration in one particular area so

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,140
that's pretty useful it also has an appt

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,760
haven't installed it I'm really not sure

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:36,520
go on a game if I'd work quite that much

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,780
but something else that I was thinking

00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:40,870
about when I was looking at things

00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:42,490
that'd be a good example to show is all

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,500
of the people sending these work from

00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:47,350
home emails yesterday live in the

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:49,000
Philadelphia area and could very well

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,570
have been going into the Philadelphia

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,670
office and because our culture is so

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,110
remote first and because everything is

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:59,470
accessible to you whether or not you're

00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:01,820
in the office asterisk except high as

00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:03,890
the less of a saying it's like what

00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:05,030
but because everything's accessible to

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,820
you whether or not you're in the office

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:09,020
even for people who love to go to the

00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:10,670
office every day and want to work right

00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,830
by where the offices a little fed where

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,140
the offices there's a lot of benefits to

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,330
not having to worry about scheduling all

00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:20,330
these aspects their lives around some

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,160
kind of set hours so it's actually

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,340
really beneficial for us in terms of our

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,290
hiring because people who have family

00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,180
situations or wherever they want to live

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:31,520
to have situations where it becomes a

00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,750
problem like we've built this into the

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:38,240
culture and something that we've never

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,630
planned for but it's ended up being

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,250
incredibly helpful is because one of the

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:46,100
people that the pink panther in this

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:48,770
meeting is a developer in Texas who

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:50,720
works on the front end team and because

00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,790
they had already decided to do these

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,910
meetings as Google Hangouts and have the

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:57,830
pink panther in the meeting the

00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:59,570
front-end code review is completely

00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:02,000
accessible to the front end developer

00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:06,020
that hired who is deaf or hard of

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,360
hearing so if you use sometimes give

00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:11,300
benefits from making sure everything is

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,310
you know either in writing or in a

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,660
recordable forearm you get benefits that

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:16,280
you don't even dream up because we had

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:17,660
no idea of when we started working like

00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,060
this that we were going to hire p really

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,490
and then we did really wonderful a

00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,990
talented front-end developer and she

00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,330
doesn't necessarily need to pay somebody

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,890
to show up every day you can use video

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:29,830
relay service for these meetings because

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:33,830
the meetings are accessible by default

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:35,270
so it's that's actually a something that

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,650
we didn't realize would be about that's

00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:39,230
ended up being really useful for us

00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:41,330
because again everyone in the room is

00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,710
hiring we were able to hire her there

00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:44,080
may be organizations that would have had

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:49,000
a harder time making that accommodation

00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:54,650
so on another I character in this story

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:56,750
is my coworker chin and Jin is different

00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:59,150
he's a kind of you know middle of the

00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,890
stack developer who lets his job in New

00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:02,180
York just fine and hadn't been back to

00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,800
Korea since he was a kid when his

00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,480
parents decided to move there thought

00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:07,220
wouldn't this be kind of fun I get a

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,410
chance to my 20s to go live in Seoul why

00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:12,680
not it's basically like moving to the

00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:14,920
future right terms of tag so he picked

00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:17,020
up moved to Korea eating quits job

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,530
so we have the continuity of gin still

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:23,410
works for us and the developers on in

00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:25,390
his team have the amazing wonderful

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,890
thing of they wake up in the morning all

00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:28,960
their flaw requests have been reviewed

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:31,210
and there's like a whole evening so pull

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,900
request ferry you know it's like 14

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,460
hours ahead of eastern time so it's you

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,290
know everyone's Royal will stay up late

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,460
for being with us but other than that

00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:44,770
it's like it's really useful that

00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:46,450
everything in our technical workflow is

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,620
still absolutely accessible to him even

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,810
with that kind of time difference and

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:50,860
it's useful for us because again if you

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,310
didn't have to replace him when he

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,070
wanted to move and there's other people

00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,170
who work there's one of our developers

00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:01,210
he and his boyfriend while now fiance

00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:03,400
are moving to Washington State because

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,260
they want to live in Washington State he

00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,370
doesn't have to quit his job which is

00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,600
good because he's an excellent go

00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:13,720
program so um there isn't there's a

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,640
slight downside to deciding deliberately

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:17,380
to live reasonably far away from your

00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:20,020
job yet wanting to see your co-workers

00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:22,660
all the time and it pretty much you can

00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,430
see it my flight path which is I come

00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:26,790
out here a lot ate a lot of ice cream

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:30,520
with Catherine it's probably fine but

00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:33,070
but it's that some of this is

00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,380
conferences too but it's basically like

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,320
you have to make choices and a lot of

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,440
our co-workers the the pink panther guy

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,570
down in Texas Paul and in Texas I don't

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,820
think has come up since he on boarded

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:51,340
and it's like you don't have to but it's

00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:52,960
available like it is an option and my

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,790
current repeat who lives about an hour

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,830
out of Philly so he goes into the philly

00:18:54,790 --> 00:19:00,280
office a little bit more than I do but

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,870
not much more as you can see by the fact

00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,400
that when we're in the philly office we

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:04,270
actually just stand at the same standing

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,940
desk because there's really not enough

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,010
room guess not you know we don't usually

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,240
we don't have desks there but all of

00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:12,550
those working from home people there's

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:13,990
usually a desk and we gave a

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,870
presentation together Eva drank

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:19,360
presentation and crafts com and unlike

00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:20,770
Todd and Aaron yesterday who it's clear

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,810
that they spend a lot of time together

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,340
like big night or two sorry i was

00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,140
impressed comp thinking

00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,789
have some looking at Catherine when that

00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,490
fit awesome if we were in Budapest Gary

00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:33,070
no I'm chef calm I tell a little logo

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,480
but so keeping your presentation

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:37,840
together and we had medic named three or

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,880
four times in person and people could

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,929
tell I guess because we had bunch of

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,429
people asking if he was in Minneapolis

00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:47,159
too I'm like no we've just been

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:51,789
practicing the warming outs it was fine

00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:53,950
but I mean having the the ability to

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:56,169
actually connect with someone without

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,450
necessarily being physically next to

00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:02,830
them is something that well we have the

00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:04,390
technology there are some things we

00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,340
talkin sincerely how the technology for

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,600
as it turns out the cookies I'm a

00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,799
current not my daughter tuna fisherman

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,659
cat does not actually like them

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,039
offensive to her she didn't like them i

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,460
said them to my co-workers not saying

00:20:12,039 --> 00:20:18,309
once that she's trying to eat but I said

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:21,940
those might work but if you're watching

00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:24,340
this video later Joe but uh you know

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,950
every once a while yeah you miss out up

00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:29,409
higher the cookies or whatever but we

00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:33,100
got them at all for that so it's okay um

00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:34,419
and there are there's one important

00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,230
business tool but I didn't mention

00:20:34,419 --> 00:20:41,169
before which is at the Yahoo fantasy

00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:44,529
sports app is very useful for connecting

00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:47,350
with design video sales and marketing

00:20:44,529 --> 00:20:49,120
and all those teams that you maybe would

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:51,279
have no reason as an ops engineer to

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,289
talk to but you join the fantasy

00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,299
football team you will talk to them you

00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,470
possibly defeat them that was my winning

00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:57,760
streak last year it all went downhill

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:01,510
from there so let's see if I'm sure we

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:03,940
do but I guess what I want to what I

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:07,750
want to just end with is if you connect

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,649
the people and care about the people you

00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:11,620
care about what you're working on

00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:14,440
together and your company makes the

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:17,460
effort to do things like put chrome

00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:20,049
boxes in all of the conference rooms and

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,399
when you're hiring when you're you know

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,899
when you're interviewing people make

00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,340
sure the revolts can interview them to

00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:26,049
do all the interviews with a google

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:27,399
hangout if they come in in person for

00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,779
the interview in the car lots of the

00:21:27,399 --> 00:21:31,080
conference room so there's a lot of

00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:32,950
technical details like that and

00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,899
different organizations are going to

00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:35,710
implement that stuff different ways but

00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:37,299
I did

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,799
deliberately didn't go with the giant

00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:40,270
checklist of things you have to buy for

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,279
your conference room because I think

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,500
that's where companies start to feel

00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:46,990
like they can't do this and you don't

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,360
have to do all of that google hangouts

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,760
is free all you don't have to do all of

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,010
that in order to do this like you just

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,440
have to have people willing to put

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,710
everything in format it's going to be

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,659
accessible to the remotes we actually

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:06,340
are vice president of engineering Ryan

00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:08,429
race moved to like the kind of satellite

00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,570
floor the filly office so that

00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:13,600
deliberately so that he would not be

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,309
where the other managers were and so

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,779
then they had conversation and he was

00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,880
they went to that kid decided oh we were

00:22:16,779 --> 00:22:21,700
just talking about it no you are it's

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,740
not a gif of issue it's like but if you

00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:26,110
have to have your management choose to

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:29,380
make those sort of decisions but if

00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:31,480
they're willing to if they do and if the

00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:34,720
team members are willing to keep

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,429
everything as transparent as they can it

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,299
came work really well it works really

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:43,120
well for us grab my papers awesome and

00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:44,380
we're hiring and it can run out the new

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,880
york tech day when they're handing those

00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:49,600
out they probably still have some down

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,340
at the office so if you want to you want

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,960
to work with me doing this stuff it's

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,750
pretty fun if you want to talk more

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,090
about it I love to talk about it I I

00:22:55,750 --> 00:23:00,520
went to a few open spaces at a few days

00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:02,679
before deciding to take over Mel gig I

00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,090
think Pittsburgh and maybe Silicon

00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:05,980
Valley but definitely Idaho State

00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:08,580
Pittsburgh last year those are really

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,870
good about open space on remote work and

00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:12,309
it's not necessarily whether you're

00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,510
decided to take her about gig or whether

00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,950
your company is exciting to bring down

00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,470
remotes it's not necessarily something

00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,789
to be done lightly but it can be I hope

00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,380
I Illustrated that it can be really

00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:21,520
rewarding and you can get benefits from

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:27,120
it that you may not have even seen

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:27,120
before so yeah that's it that's my

00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:42,590
go see if it's for questions questions

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,320
sorry the German back here first time oh

00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,710
thanks for addressing widgets perennial

00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,370
topic every DevOps day it seems like it

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:54,950
was a nice tactical mixed but sometimes

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:56,360
there's some so prosaic issues earlier

00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:59,570
Justin was saying we can you open that

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,290
book accidentally I to computers on the

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:04,580
HD seems weird thing happens you're out

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:07,640
where you got it in office we could just

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:13,660
go grab another machine on the speed do

00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:17,360
you have like extra netgear something

00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:18,560
yeah absolutely so the question was ok

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,270
if you're not in an office but there's a

00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:23,150
supply closet with the spare macbook pro

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:26,300
what happens if yours explodes a couple

00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:28,940
of things about that one is we have if

00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:31,160
you're going to move your computer you

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:34,460
must push your code up to github it can

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:36,080
be in a work in progress branch that you

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:38,450
know you can put it do not urge on the

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,740
PR we have a label in every wrinkle and

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,990
sister not marriage and people do that

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:45,110
all the time but if you don't do that

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:48,080
then you could lose some work when what

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:50,090
happens to like my coworker Pete his

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,540
second or third week of work his macbook

00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:55,100
pro just kind of died on him and he you

00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,600
know lives an hour outside Philly and

00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,960
kind of wanted to keep working that day

00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,240
and what he was given the discretion to

00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,920
just go to the apple store by one or the

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,660
apple authorized reseller they haven't

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:07,040
Doylestown Pennsylvania I don't know so

00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,070
I think that a local store there's some

00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:12,320
kind of offer and a store but but yeah

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:15,620
so I mean even though we don't have like

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,840
you know we do have an actual IT person

00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:19,670
in the New York office to you know deal

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,740
with that sort of thing but like for

00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:23,390
people who are remotes when I got the

00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:26,720
Thunderbolt monitor for that standing

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:29,270
desk like I just went to the apple store

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,620
we have that kind of I guess I don't

00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:32,210
know that it's splendid and then in

00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,370
terms of I do have two laptops because I

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,809
have one for work and this one covered

00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,400
stickers is actually my personal one

00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:40,010
because it's tiny I like traveling with

00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,620
a tiny laptop but I find that that's

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,480
mostly useful if I want to be like

00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:48,169
running test kitchen on two different

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,970
branches I think it's annoying to do

00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:52,070
that in terms of like your kitchen that

00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:55,130
animal files it's like I actually do use

00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,840
both of them sometimes but the doctor

00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:58,490
thing does help in terms of the if you

00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,250
blow up your local like you can be up

00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,110
and all you need is your AWS keys you

00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,030
can be up and running yet very very

00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:12,770
short warmer I hope that answers your

00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:17,600
question okay and Jason yeah so with Jim

00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:20,270
you're you're very very eat do you ever

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,370
run into problems work he because of the

00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,260
time difference because these different

00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,570
world you need some more like

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:30,940
synchronous communication and how do you

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:30,940
handle like he's sleeping you're working

00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:35,870
with that yeah so if we want to have

00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:39,409
synchronous communication with an

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:41,360
employee who's you know in Seoul he does

00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:43,610
stay up pretty late he's kind of a night

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,039
owl so we do intersect I mean I seen him

00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,130
on slack almost every day so like we do

00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:52,549
have some a few hours of intersection

00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:54,679
but we also we don't have anything I

00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,270
really long live feature branches and we

00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,510
practice like you know calculus

00:26:56,270 --> 00:27:01,850
developments so once he gets something

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:03,590
of his you know merged in like if it

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,659
blows up master yeah we might have to

00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:09,620
refer but like it's not gonna blow up

00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:12,380
rod so it is it thinks I guess they're

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,299
happen sometimes like a blocker may come

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:16,429
into play that we have to wait for it

00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:18,289
but it's not usually it's not usually

00:27:16,429 --> 00:27:21,679
going to affect us either operationally

00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:24,140
or from like that we're not going to

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:27,350
leave the bill broken so if it can't be

00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,710
fixed to can easily be reverted if that

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,660
does that make sense

00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:34,550
pretty cool what do you what do you

00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:45,260
recommend maybe any tips or advice you

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:49,490
have yeah i mean that's that's tough

00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:51,830
because um it's oh yeah so he guessed

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,920
what I recommended in terms of keeping

00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:57,050
remote workers motivated since they have

00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:01,400
the flexibility to you know I don't know

00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:03,530
not work I guess and so I think at least

00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,420
from my point of view I'm having a day

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:06,980
that I'm really feeling down and I feel

00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:09,230
like I can't be productive I try to

00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,290
figure out what's wrong did I forget to

00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:15,170
eat or have I not seen any humans for

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:16,850
like two days and I try to solve

00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:18,620
whatever that is that's getting in the

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,450
way we want it to work so I love my job

00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,450
so it usually want to work on it unless

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:26,840
there's something else going on and my

00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:28,880
boss is also pretty good about like you

00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,070
know if I say like I know we just had

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,770
our one-on-one but I need to talk like

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,930
okay he is he worse at home two days a

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:38,120
week himself this conference face is

00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,170
always this was it does anybody work

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,700
someplace where you have enough

00:28:39,170 --> 00:28:43,910
conference rooms the conference space is

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,530
not a problem thug getting a private

00:28:43,910 --> 00:28:47,780
room for a conference room sometimes

00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:50,270
requires him to actually like use the

00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:53,690
kitchen counter as a standing desk in

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:54,890
the office that's football but or if

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,510
he's working from home like it's much

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,820
easier of course but he's totally taking

00:28:56,510 --> 00:29:00,140
if an employee needs to talk like he'll

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:02,780
talk to them from the kitchen from the

00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,790
pantry or from you know the hallway so

00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,650
like you have to i guess the managers my

00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:09,170
view is you have to make sure that

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:11,480
you're available to your employees when

00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:13,220
think either when they need you to

00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,710
problem which has sometimes need or when

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,760
they need to reject you and if they're

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,300
not reaching out you still have to pay

00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,530
attention to that so yeah i feel like

00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,210
i'm only taking questions from the side

00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:26,600
of the room i'm sorry so let slip to the

00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:28,750
side of murders okay I'm gonna go with

00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:33,040
push all the way back stark risk

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,240
you sir oh well from the firm this

00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,480
direction you're out of here I'll have

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,480
fat

00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:54,110
something that I've noticed is that when

00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,110
people

00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:02,330
they things that are important to us

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:05,050
like I'm people say take bring up a

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:05,050
second computer

00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:25,070
what I mean I think some of that is back

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,120
to the empathy thing so maybe they

00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:28,490
should try to run in one of those

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:29,809
meetings from home and see how they like

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,400
watching just the slides for three hours

00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:33,230
and not seeing that all the things that

00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,930
speakers what you know doing same with

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:38,510
their with their you know body language

00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:40,940
in their face because we do especially

00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,559
in cases a conflict resolution we do try

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,870
to go to the highest family form of

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,250
communication possible and you can't

00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:47,540
always get on a plane and time to

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,460
resolve an argument but you can usually

00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:52,280
get a google hangout and if you can't

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:54,470
the person it does make it harder so and

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,940
it also does break up the tedium of

00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:00,170
really long presentations if you can

00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:02,059
look at a human humans so I think maybe

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,309
if you could the people who are adverse

00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:06,140
to you know making those changes if you

00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:08,240
ask them dry the meeting from home

00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,070
yourself and see what you think like

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,840
they should have the ability to try that

00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:20,840
and then maybe they'll find out what

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:22,610
it's like Francis microphones that they

00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:32,360
were camping conferences you mean like

00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:33,800
the swirls laughs I can you know tweeted

00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,960
me later and i can probably get that

00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:37,340
information for you because we do have I

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:39,620
didn't even go into detail about it but

00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,360
we do have a we created Monday morning

00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,500
meeting that's the whole company we

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,120
didn't know having to change it to a

00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,679
hangout on air because Google Hangouts

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,820
has an arbitrary and capricious limits

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,309
to the number of people who can be a

00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:53,660
little face on the bottom of the screen

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:56,420
but the but anyway we have we worked

00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,100
with our head of product also kind of

00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,830
has a theatrical vente Gus and so we run

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:02,510
to be like you know placing the tape on

00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:05,179
the floor and setting up the mic so that

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:06,830
the people who are presenting about

00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:08,270
their departments can actually be seen

00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,679
as well as hurts otherwise they would be

00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,100
standing over there anything like their

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,710
arm is great but all the rest of them

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,600
all right yeah you have two questions

00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:21,940
here it's time for lunch on the start

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,940
getting angry thank you and Bridget
