00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,340
mayan talk was yesterday I mean it's

00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,529
good to see that he we are human beings

00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,630
we have problems and something sometimes

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,610

00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:42,120
this so this talk is about it's about

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:45,270
success but more than success the sock

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,700
is about fader and especially the

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:50,010
mistakes that we made when you think

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,280
that success and failure are two

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:55,199
different facts two different roles so

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,000
we should not think of them being as two

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,739
different roads single serve the

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,510
moderator just have yourselves a river

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,570
in mind which is something that's very

00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:05,700
organic and created a major has created

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,280
their River through the years it river

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,260
has many affluents and you cannot tell

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:12,360
that the river has not served is purple

00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,580
with you can don't take it so much

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,750
different directions they also want this

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,509
company this company has been in

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,549
business for around 62 years and they've

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,580
created one product that has more than

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,650
2,000 official purposes and what were

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,210
the problems that you all know that

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:31,770
would be 40 what's the good thing about

00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:33,329
this someone has failed 39 times or it

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,729
could actually get a problem which is

00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:37,950
called lucky for teams that would ease

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,079
that water displacement for someone

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,329
failed 39 times have this in mind this

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,240
other company called trigger trap liquid

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:48,570
awesome products for four cameras so you

00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,880
can have a camera that the trigger is

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,140
triggered by some characteristics and

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,500
with this trigger you can create awesome

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,299
shots like like this ahh ok good time

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,579
like awesome shots like this you know

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,909
like you set some parameters and based

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,250
on temperature is lighting based on

00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,820
sound it triggers and create speaker

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,340
helping on soothed by those pics

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,650
the case I get sued I'll buy and make us

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,390
30 blocks out of it so look at this look

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:15,670
at this liquid happens right this

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,100
totally they failed on a five hundred

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,390
thousand dollars Kickstarter projects

00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,900
one of the largest and kick-starting

00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:25,270
started here too to help me on this life

00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,160
so they have failed and what why they

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:29,200
have failed in a few last stop talking

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,410
about their less than 10 miles lesson

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,970
number one fail faster it took them too

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,890
long to favor you jump them too long

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,230
they face a lot of money in the project

00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,000
and then they took them too long to fail

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,500
so they're all so these are the other

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,090
lessons i'm not going to go through over

00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,100
this lesson off but these are dear

00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:48,370
lesson so you can take a look what were

00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:54,520
the lessons and why what how was it that

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:57,010
they fail so i'll talk about then so

00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,930
what does have to do devops i know this

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,269
is kind of hard to read that's also part

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,630
of this this is like so what the city

00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:06,489
has to do with them up so i think i

00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:09,340
think the main we're here to have a

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:12,549
failure and their ups if it's about

00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,180
experimentation you know that Bob's must

00:03:12,549 --> 00:03:17,230
not be an environment that furnishes

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,989
experimentation must not be an

00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,570
environment that punishes failure and if

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:25,180
you can't try yourself stuff it's

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,430
impossible for you to know it right you

00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:31,209
cannot just innovate when they don't try

00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:34,269
some father so I just write it in myself

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,100
there is no problem is the projector

00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:41,019
units in fact it's a best funny

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:44,290
projector so so what do i do then as a

00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:46,150
devil so what do i do right so MIA the

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:48,730
devil why should i do so this is like a

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,920
few lessons that I've put out ideas like

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,690
talking to friends I'm not that old they

00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,790
cannot say that I have 35 years of

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,590
whatever experience but I've talking to

00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:59,049
people and this a few them one of them

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,180
is like see your project as rd are any

00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:02,739
activity or authority but more is

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:05,860
researched and developed because

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:08,500
research is about trying things out and

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,660
the bone it's about making things more

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,280
irregardless help results and this is a

00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,780
very mornings like we all work which

00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,000
technology I mean I had to bring one

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:17,720
boring slide but you have to have tools

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,120
right this is no matter what

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,010
in what state you are I mean there's no

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,910
way to run away from tools you need

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,670
software that would automate things and

00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:31,160
this is this is also big problem that we

00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,710
have that we normally expect change in

00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,660
our in our in our product so yeah I'm

00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,820
ready to change ready for change comes

00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,370
but then you're not ready for failure

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,460
comes so I have I say this you should

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,010
expect more faded exchange and this is a

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:48,020
simple matter expect we're all guns here

00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,820
if you think about containers I'm just

00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:51,560
saying this word once right no you're

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:55,790
not saying that you bored that's like

00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,950
your privacy from lots of p.m. see lots

00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,230
of my dance right and you really have to

00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:02,930
pray for your boss so yourself ok your

00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,460
agenda and see how much time your boss

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,620
is worried about keeping things running

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:09,470
then about making your place a better

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,120
workplace so if you are the boss hope

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:13,580
someone prays for me and then the end

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,860
result that's a direct success they

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,410
don't you know the same fat no you

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,810
should like to achieve success you have

00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,850
to have a change fader lots of times

00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,800
before it so that's why I see that the

00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:27,860
bob says your great expense ability

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,330
trader and success are the same road and

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,330
