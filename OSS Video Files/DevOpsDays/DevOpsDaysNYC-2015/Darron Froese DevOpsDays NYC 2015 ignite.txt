	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
our last two nights speakers for today

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,899
is an SRE add a dog who happens to be

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:13,160
one of our sponsors and do some cool

00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:16,199
things with good grass shout out to them

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,980
he's also a food enthusiast so he could

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:29,789
be talking about scuba hand offs here is

00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:32,250
Darren froze my name is Darren froze and

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:35,160
I mini-site liability engineer who dated

00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,420
off base right here in an atom I'm here

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:39,899
to talk about to my favorite things

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:43,410
scuba adopts you might wonder how these

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,960
two items mix and well both the time I

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,760
don't actually makes the times we read

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,890
correctly beats for me I've been sitting

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,379
on a dive boat next to a lake with my

00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,899
phone to reboot server but there are

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,129
some parallels that do mix that I want

00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,260
to talk about here today yes first off

00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,480
the whole thing a teen for you properly

00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,119
so you need more than just a single

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,430
tonight sir most I'm use going buddy

00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:10,020
pairs so here's if you were done and see

00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,130
how high you specialize and give you

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,439
extra situational awareness good teams

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,049
are able to accomplish more and get

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,330
better results so these divers that you

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:23,790
see went seven miles underwater one cave

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:25,350
to another set a world record but more

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:28,409
than 50 people were involved in the

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:31,890
attempt so it takes quite a 15 in this

00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:33,540
case good teams also standardized our

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,000
equipment and procedures which allow for

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,320
the same operation for everybody now

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,090
don't worry we're not after clothes

00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,549
everybody still gets to wear their own

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,340
unique conference t-shirts but

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,799
Saturday's ation is helpful because

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,399
otherwise confusion leads to anger maybe

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,960
we just shouldn't use upstart supervisor

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,060
SB run it and daughter in a single

00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,040
system does it make does it make things

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,890
more confusing or we'll just bike chain

00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,189
because we can standardization is not a

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,860
buzzkill it's helpful now there's an old

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,920
saying this as this there are old divers

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,429
and there are old

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,660
so that there are no old bold divers

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:13,090
teams are not a crutch they are a

00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,640
necessity and ego has no place

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,489
underwater now on the edge of any

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,920
discipline failure is expected but how

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,560
you deal with failure is key it will

00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:25,270
school in ops panic is your enemy so

00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,470
when a failure occurs you want to

00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:31,780
respond both quickly and accurately when

00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:34,720
I when I was trained I was off the test

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:37,510
with random failures during dives we had

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,220
to react appropriately now when any of

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,470
those scenarios occur on a real dive

00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,370
it's not something new i've done it

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,769
dozens of times last fall when i was

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:52,450
unreported most of the cloud sounds our

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:54,130
team was concerned but after one day we

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:57,069
were ahead of schedule and with practice

00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:00,430
were really adult so quickly that i

00:02:57,069 --> 00:03:04,030
became trivial practice makes perfect as

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,250
i said so actual off aliens can be

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,780
complex and have many factors when

00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:10,060
you've trained in practice then your

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:11,829
reactions can be long back which can

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,090
help you adapt to these situations and

00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:17,920
make them out events in the visual of

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,900
them who was called pre-brief a

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:21,670
pre-agreed is a five-minute process

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,590
where i sit on the surface i briefed my

00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,079
equipment and I monitor how I'm feeling

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,049
this is the most important in my diet

00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:31,180
reckless and I never stated the reason I

00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:33,730
never stated is because on one of my

00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,549
earliest eyes I neglected all all of the

00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:39,100
checklist but doing my pre be exposed to

00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:41,440
failure that would have killed me for

00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,480
most of us in ops skipping some items on

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,450
checklist is available but for scuba

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,359
checklist save lives as a technical

00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:51,670
diver as well one of one of anything is

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:54,430
never enough one tank full of delicious

00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:56,980
breathing gas good two tanks gently

00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,079
together is better single points of

00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:01,989
failure as many people talk about or to

00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,840
get what it at all costs just like

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,840
anything in life even basic competency

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,359
takes time money and design master if

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,940
any subject takes even more of his hand

00:04:10,359 --> 00:04:16,269
if you plateaued and like keep growing

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,170
just keep swimming so this is actually

00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,420
called the diet profile I don't

00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:22,490
is a pretty bad one if anyone goes with

00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,230
that looks like that sort of that is

00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,700
hard on your body and can lead to

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,120
serious injuries and it's actually one

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,610
of my earliest eyes I was terrible duh

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,610
but I took those first terrible dr. Hart

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:38,150
and many dives and many credit cards

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,700
full of done gear later I can now pull

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,220
it off properly and it made safe 9

00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,600
profiles mastery takes time dedication

00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:49,640
and perseverance an ops career just like

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,100
a school addiction isn't for everybody

00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:54,830
it takes time and desire to learn the

00:04:52,100 --> 00:05:01,790
basics and many years to learn that DP

00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:04,670
packages are the one true passion thank

00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:06,560
you it all goes the other and you

00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:09,140
can do a flawless sooner the diamond

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,420
which are covered rack or a cluster

00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,670
cluster white Council server operators

00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,970
jump down down time it can be a thing of

00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:19,490
beauty thanks for listening in quick

00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:22,040
summary it takes your team a failure

00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,340
happens so mad and just keep swimming so
