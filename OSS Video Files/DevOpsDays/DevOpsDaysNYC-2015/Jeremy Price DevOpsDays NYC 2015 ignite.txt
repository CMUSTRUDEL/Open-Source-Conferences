sorry guys I want you to present you

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,779
guys Jeremy price I want to mention that

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,580
he was a devil stays your city here in

00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,010
the fall in September and he actually

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,240
practices public speaking by discussing

00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,500
how to make guacamole in public not that

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,880
the public part wasn't it's like we're

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,529
waiting something he was publicly

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,850
speaking about maybe walking lowly so

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,189
you can ask him about that if you want

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,830
to he also likes jumping out of planes

00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:28,080
and he can help you do that so anyway

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,449
with his presentation that is presenting

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,700
mixed metaphors reducing us factory lone

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,710
wolves let's say that I've been gone you

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:37,219
have your own vessel I will turn soften

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,969
it was you okay everybody hear me ok

00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:46,469
we're going to get closer yeah ok let's

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:48,870
get this going hi I am Jeremy price or

00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:50,489
drops on the twitters I have been in

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,309
small text arts for most of my career

00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:55,350
and a sole practitioner for a good bit

00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:56,940
of that stuff and through a few times if

00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,469
you don't know what I mean by a bus

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,199
factor it is how screwed we'll the

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:03,719
company be if I get it by a bus I'm of

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,700
us after 1 i'm also a bear factor 1 this

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,030
is a picture of the 500-pound bear who

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,740
lives near in my office point is not a

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,930
single point of failure and we start to

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,299
think about what that means for the

00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,189
business that's a good thing also the

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,869
Augusta some interesting things like we

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,570
need to be making ourselves more

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,400
redundant and spreading out our load it

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:25,259
is crazy we spend so much time making

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:31,020
all of our system is very redundant and

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:34,040
yet making ourselves indispensable yeah

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,119
so even if we don't fall off the cliff

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,490
just making ourselves we're done it will

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,020
take work proper work off our plates and

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,229
giving back something really really

00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,350
precious time time to relax kind of

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,360
sleep maybe or maybe just time to get

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,430
more stuff done so stop building all the

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,619
things I love to build the things too

00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:54,149
but it's a trap when nearby ourselves

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:55,950
sometimes you have to build things in

00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,140
the house but for the most part there

00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,149
are entire businesses devoted to making

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,979
things happen better than you probably

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,710
will and it's going to save you lots of

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,020
time so stop running your own monitoring

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,910
stop running your own email they take

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,550
care and feeding and you don't have time

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,440
to

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,060
crap most of these services have free

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,360
tears and even from ones that don't it's

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:19,480
going to save you way more to the time

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,550
you will save by using them please

00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,810
manage system can fix it doesn't happen

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,400
to be doesn't have to be one of these

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,290
tools but for the love of pasta do

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,270
something to get things in the source

00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:30,220
control and make things repeatable make

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:31,810
things repeatable it makes things more

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,900
reliable and it saves you have lots of

00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,480
time once you have things repeatable you

00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:38,860
can put them off button running a big

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,260
management script to add a new employee

00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,820
is great but it's even better page our

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:44,530
can go push the button for you because

00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,510
it saves you time saves you an interrupt

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:52,930
cycle and that's awesome getting buttons

00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,790
is easy just go get Jenkins it's more

00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:56,470
than just a CI system it's more than

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:58,870
just a control panel it's also a floor

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,430
wax and dessert topping it hooks into

00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,960
everything so let it be your control

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,350
panel because again why build one

00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:07,240
yourself and it's free once you have one

00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,970
button it's easy to make more so go make

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,620
buttons to deploy things go make buttons

00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:13,270
to bring data down from prod for your

00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,739
devs go make buttons to make new users

00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,840
go and make buttons to order pizza and

00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:18,550
beer the point is every time somebody

00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,470
else pushes a button it's one that you

00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,720
don't have push I have a button that

00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,070
takes our it takes our site down put

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,330
something make this page and anybody in

00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,550
the company can go push it if there's a

00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:29,500
problem I have another button that any

00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:32,770
of the dev team can push to go restart

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:35,020
all the things if everyone if anybody

00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,180
can turn it off and on again that means

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,880
that you don't have to you want to make

00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,080
your life easier by doing these things

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,090
then you also make life easier for your

00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,920
desk people like to be empowered and

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,989
takes forgot your plate your devs means

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,709
have your you each have your debts happy

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:51,970
are you so it's great way to get a good

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,350
relationship going if you don't already

00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:57,340
have one and be a bridge builder be nice

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,110
once you get them using some of your

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:01,870
tools learn some of theirs teach each

00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:03,610
other to fish learn some of the text

00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,110
step you know I know Django so I can

00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,800
help my dad's debug things for any

00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,790
operations perspective and it's awesome

00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,350
once you lower your interrupt level

00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,420
you'll be more productive now you have

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,700
more time to do things to make them meet

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,070
me less will give you more time to do

00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,620
things it's a great feedback loop but it

00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,010
works either direction so work toward

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,110
better way even with Deb's on board but

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,479
especially if they're not being your own

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,530
team can get lonely nicely it doesn't

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,940
have to be though there's a huge

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,530
technically you got here and lots of us

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,750
are in the same boat you made a great

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:38,680
step by coming here not to keep it going

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,930
come up and say hi meet people get on

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,449
Twitter get on IRC do we meet us you

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,490
have peers of the community so commute

00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:47,380
you'll learn so much more about how to

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:51,699
operate in community than you will in

00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:53,050
our own little pots so reach out and I

00:04:51,699 --> 00:04:58,150
know reaching out can be really really

00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:59,800
hard it comes naturally some of us but

00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:02,740
for a lot of it a lot of people out here

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,210
we weren't built to be able to go out we

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,620
have lots of introverts in our community

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,340
some of the most prolific people they

00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,770
get up on stage and prolific on Twitter

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:14,110
have a tough time yeah so my point is

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,729
you're not alone we all take a lot upon

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,770
ourselves and have a lot expected of us

00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,479
and if you really overwhelming pronoun

00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:23,169
is a real thing so even people at your

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:25,630
org don't get it we do reach out hit me

00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:27,220
up or check out born I oh so I'm short

00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,720
on time but they're all sorts of ways to

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,310
make things better and easier sometimes

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,930
you just can't fix what's going on at

00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:34,360
your place so when that time comes call

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:36,550
me or any of the companies who are here

00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,840
because everybody is hiring like the end

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,130
of the tunnel may be applying some of

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,770
the things that I've said today or maybe

00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:44,110
applying the rule two feet so that's it

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:47,169
I was helpful this was my first talk so

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,669
I would love some feedback and I would

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:51,160
also love to follow up with people about

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:52,180
the things that I've talked about so if

00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,789
you want to talk or jump out of an

00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,789
