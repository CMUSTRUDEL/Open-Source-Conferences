Title: devopsdaysNYC 2020 - Day 2 - Matt Stratton - The Lifecycle of A Service
Publication date: 2020-03-30
Playlist: DevOpsDays NYC 2020
Description: 
	Services are the backbone of our systems. They are the pieces that make up our businesses—whether they are literal microservices or functional components of a traditional application, we can’t do the computer thing without services.

When it comes to a service in your company or organization, who’s responsible for it? The cast of characters involved in the lifecycle of a service are more than just software engineers—they can include program managers, product owners, sustainability/SRE/ops, and business stakeholders, just to name a few.

In this talk, we will follow the story of a service at the fictional FakeCorp, from when it was a tiny idea, to when it makes a billion dollars, and finally, to when we have to retire it for something better.

Topics covered in this talk include:

Defining what a service means to you and your organization
Roles in service ownership
What are you observing about your service?
How you want a team to respond to a service
Managing the service in production
Tuning your service
Understanding business impact

thanks Jay I'm really pleased to be back

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:23,650
here again at DevOps Days New York I was

00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:26,099
here last year it was a absolutely great

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:28,540
experience and I'm glad to give you a

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,250
for the most part pretty much brand new

00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,890
talk this has only been shopped out at a

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:35,050
meet-up before so buckle up let's have a

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:37,090
lot of fun and again my name is Matt I'm

00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:39,070
a DevOps advocate and thought validator

00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,210
at pedra Judy and I would tell you to go

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,250
visit the booth but the boots are all

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:44,380
shut down now so whatever but I hope you

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:46,300
went had fun anyway great so I want you

00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,670
all to imagine a world where you

00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,829
understand what you're working on you're

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:52,539
clear on what your dependencies are who

00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:54,969
relies on you and what you're delivering

00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,649
you have this clear vision of your

00:00:54,969 --> 00:00:58,690
impact on your business your

00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,999
organization and you know what you want

00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:03,070
to do to continue delivering value to

00:01:00,999 --> 00:01:05,350
those people that you care about you

00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,120
innovate you try new things and you can

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,159
solve problems effectively when they

00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,960
come up you and your colleagues work

00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,180
together to bring value to your business

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,530
without blame and you can make changes

00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:18,040
without being afraid of unintended

00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:20,259
consequences sounds dope right all right

00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,909
let's see how we can get there so here's

00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:24,310
the thing we talked about this idea of

00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:26,350
service ownership and this means that

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,950
people take responsibility for what they

00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:33,009
deliver at every stage of a services

00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:34,899
lifetime and embracing service ownership

00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:37,060
is a way to get to that vision I talked

00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:38,979
about on the last slide but let's get

00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:41,439
started with a word here what the hell

00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:43,119
is a service anyway right we could talk

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,590
about this for an open space for 30

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,909
minutes about every different definition

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,860
of a service I could ask 10 engineers

00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:50,110
what is services and I'll get 15

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,939
different definitions right and it can

00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:53,590
be a lot of different things right maybe

00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:54,820
a service is a micro service that's

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:56,740
probably where your head went first

00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,869
because I mean it's DevOps day so micro

00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,640
service all the things right but it

00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:03,159
could also be referred to a slice of a

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,170
monolith it would be an internal tool

00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,270
maybe we're thinking about a piece of

00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,820
functionality maybe we're thinking about

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,820
a component or a shared infrastructure

00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,770
or even a feature these are all things

00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,540
that could be a way we think about a

00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:19,060
service and here's what it boils down to

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,270
if it provides value to other people

00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:24,040
that's a service so the first thing is

00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,680
you need to understand what it means to

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,270
you there's no one right answer the

00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,770
wrong answer is when you disagree

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,110
with the rest of your organization about

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:33,490
what a service is so I'll give you an

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,440
example this is how we think about a

00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:38,320
service of page or duty so our

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,960
definition is kind of specific to some

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,060
form of infrastructure that might be

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,950
composed of multiple distinct services

00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:48,160
that might be written as separate pieces

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,230
of code right the thing is its wholly

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,320
owned by a team I like to think about

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,650
his service as a boundary of

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,840
responsibility and it's important to

00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:00,910
have this shared understanding of those

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,460
boundaries and figure out who the

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,800
stakeholders of that service are if

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,510
there are multiple teams contributing

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,150
maintaining and supporting a given

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,690
service this shared understanding

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:16,090
becomes even more important so you can

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,940
start by considering who is responsible

00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,520
for this service that we're defining so

00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:24,700
a service should be wholly owned by the

00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,680
team that is on-call for it again that's

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,370
where I think about a service definition

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,740
is a boundary of responsibility if

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:35,790
multiple teams share responsibility for

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,959
a service sometimes it's better to

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,090
administrative Lee if you will split

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,640
that service up into separate ones

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,640
some organizations call this service

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,400
mitosis may making a rule that at a

00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,950
certain team size or a certain volume of

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,290
code the service and team must be split

00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,630
up and yes lines of code is a crap

00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,680
metric but you know if you use that

00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:00,280
don't feel too bad about yourself

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,320
there's worse things you can do services

00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,350
should be set up granularly enough to

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:07,480
help identify where problems are coming

00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:10,420
from so the thing is if two micro

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,820
services always basically behave as one

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,740
area and fixing a problem in one

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,709
generally means fixing it somewhere else

00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,049
then yeah don't get pedantic and say

00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,609
well technically these are two micro

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:23,169
services so they should be defined

00:04:21,609 --> 00:04:25,630
separately no they're really one bit of

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,510
business functionality as far as a

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,919
boundary responsibility goes so what

00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:31,690
about the monolith our friend the

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,780
monolith also thanks to Erin for

00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,790
correcting this slide I had Stonehenge

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,590
up before and he reminded me that's not

00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:41,390
a monolith that's something else

00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:43,070
so pedantry is a thing right

00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:44,860
so the thing is if you have a model and

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:46,730
first of all don't feel bad it's cool

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,970
but think about how you're going to

00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,470
address on-call responsibilities for it

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,820
monoliths tend to be involved in a lot

00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,950
of incidents just because they're big

00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,320
and they span a lot of stuff so it's

00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:59,900
okay and sometimes they're actionable

00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,760
and sometimes they're not so if one team

00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:03,560
owns the whole monolith they usually

00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,800
don't own any other services unless

00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,810
somehow the on-call the monolith is low

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,880
but if multiple teams share

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,710
responsibility for this monolith think

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
about how you can carve up those areas

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:17,330
of responsibility based on functionality

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,220
and then route the alerts related that

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,770
functionality to those teams who have

00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:23,870
the ownership right each source of

00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:26,080
functionality can be represented as a

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,490
different service in your documentation

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,200
enumerated in your run books and wikis

00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,500
along with your on-call ownership in

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,810
something like pager duty so the thing

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,970
is service ownership really is a shared

00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,740
responsibility it's not just the

00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:42,290
software engineers who sling the code

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,570
who are accountable to the ownership of

00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:45,740
what that service does and what I'm

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,420
going to do now is I'm going to step

00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,510
through some of those different roles in

00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:52,400
this shared responsibility and as I talk

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:54,500
about a role that you might identify

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,330
with you might find yourself sitting

00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,970
there going Maddie I already know that

00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,620
 you know what that's cool listen to

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:02,420
the other parts because that's what's

00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:04,490
really interesting right I want you to

00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:06,470
think about the roles of the other folks

00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:07,850
who are involved in service ownership

00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,140
and hey maybe you'll learn something

00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,870
about your own role too that'd be cool

00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,460
so let's think about folks who identify

00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,680
as devs as Christine said yesterday

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,210
right so developing a service as a

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,160
software engineer is more than just

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,470
writing the code yes of course it

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,320
involves the code right in the some type

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,870
of shared repo hopefully got some Doc's

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:28,850
you know and whatever contract that

00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:31,340
service provides there other services

00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:33,320
might need to understand thing is all

00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,390
these pieces as you're developing a

00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,770
service you may not know the answers to

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,440
all this stuff as you're initially

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:41,390
designing and creating it but you want

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,520
to have some kind of standard process

00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:45,380
that your organization is agreed upon

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,410
it's similar to what Jana talked about

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,700
yesterday with the review the production

00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,160
readiness right so it's the same thing

00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:54,190
you want a common way you do this right

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,600
and the thing is

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,360
you're not the only person who's gonna

00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,820
interact with this service unless it's

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,290
my code that sits in a repo that nobody

00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:04,060
ever looks like nobody ever runs my

00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,250
applications but hopefully you don't

00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:07,900
have that problem so you want to make

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,820
sure that that code is reviewed with

00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,040
other members of your team by whatever

00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:13,480
process is appropriate for you and

00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,460
because you're not always gonna be

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,950
around to answer questions about this

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,140
stuff that you've created so you it is

00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:21,970
incumbent upon you to make it

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,610
understandable enough so you're not the

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:28,060
single point of contact and this takes

00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:29,890
being deliberate and thinking about and

00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:31,600
again the person you're helping might be

00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:34,570
future you so maybe you want to be

00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:36,280
selfish at school like to say the two

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:38,590
hardest things in computer science are

00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:40,000
caching strategies and naming there's

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:41,380
also an off by one joke in here

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,660
somewhere

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,380
and that's not initially wrong right so

00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:50,290
it's totally common to use clever and

00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:52,540
fun and silly names whether they're

00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,580
Greek mythical figures inside jokes

00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,920
pop-culture references species of

00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,900
Pokemon you know as placeholders for

00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,760
your service names and when you have a

00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,200
small organization you think that

00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,840
everyone's always going to remember all

00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,390
these inside jokes and references but

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,770
your organization's gonna grow right the

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,690
team's gonna grow you're gonna bring in

00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:12,730
new people and eventually the memories

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,580
of that inside joke are gonna fade and

00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:18,280
now you have to explain it over and over

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:19,690
again to everybody and to be honest at

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:21,430
that point if you have to explain the

00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,620
joke it probably wasn't that funny in

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,270
the first place so you know to kind of

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,550
paraphrase Seinfeld I'm also offended as

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,620
a comedian it's your bad service names

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,520
but so here's the thing so you want to

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,710
be specific

00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,200
right and this is boring I get it it's

00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:37,570
not fun but name the service based on

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,339
what it actually does and if you already

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,589
have services with these less than

00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:43,030
specific names don't panic you don't

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,339
have to fix everything right away this

00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:47,110
takes some time so think about fixing

00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,060
forward right and starting to name the

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,250
new things and then you know embracing

00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:53,230
kind of that that pattern of letting the

00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:55,240
other stuff fall off right you want to

00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,580
default to longish names instead of

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,750
these really short ones well here's the

00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,880
thing you go too long you know what

00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:03,010
people do with long names they turn them

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,540
into acronyms and now you have the same

00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:05,890
problem you had with your inside joke

00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,640
and now you got to explain that acronym

00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:09,680
and what it really means we always

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,450
that acronym save us time but they

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,970
actually just add cognitive overload and

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,530
they just generally suck alright that's

00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,970
the technical term so like these are

00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:19,160
names that are specific and yeah I

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,750
understand they're not very clever but

00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,890
they say what they do you could look at

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,780
this service and you could probably

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:26,300
reason about what the hell it's supposed

00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:29,500
to actually do these are names that are

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:32,330
less amazing like don't name it pac-man

00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,340
burgundy B is not clever so just get

00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:36,140
over it right I have a colleague who's

00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,930
worked at four different organizations

00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,910
with a service named Artemis this is

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,560
probably not the last place she's worked

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,590
at that will have it she will see it

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,410
again so then it doesn't tell you

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,300
anything about it right we want to think

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,510
about how we describe the service beyond

00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:56,000
just its name so what is the intent of

00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,250
this service where this is where you can

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,680
record its purpose it's raised on to

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,420
terror why does it exist right more

00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,870
importantly how does it deliver value

00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:07,520
that kind of matters you know what does

00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,340
it contribute to is it part of a

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,980
customer facing feature explain how it

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,630
impacts customers and the description

00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,670
could also mention the other components

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,340
that it may interact with but know that

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,290
those change as the service owners make

00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,960
changes of those components dependencies

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:25,190
are kind of a thing I'm not gonna take

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,990
too much into this but when you think

00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:30,140
about your service may present itself as

00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,720
an API of some sort and thinking about

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,370
versioning that provides a lot of value

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,640
for the people who are consuming it I

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,050
always go back to this this this thought

00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,520
where when we would we would make

00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:43,340
changes to a service so this was pre

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,380
micro service days back in good old soap

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,660
and my CTO was like what we have to

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,740
check we have to test every single time

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,150
we test one of these things we have to

00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:51,920
test all of the functionality through

00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,100
everything all the way back to the data

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,870
warehouse and I said as a derisive boss

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,100
when Google updates our Maps API do they

00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,660
reach out to every single one of their

00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,160
customers and ask them to check it know

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,720
that it's version right so that you can

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,250
work to that so thinking whether it's

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,470
through cember or API versioning those

00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,550
things matter all right so let's think

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:09,920
another roll so this is maybe your

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,320
sustainability team right which this is

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,150
a kind of a broad strokes this might be

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,380
you might call them a Suri's you might

00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:16,580
not because you might argue with me

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,350
about whether or not s3 is our

00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,680
sustainability teams call them what you

00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,450
want

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,040
maybe it's ops whatever it is either

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,139
folks are

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,389
kind of helping thinking about the the

00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,610
Karen feeding if you will so run books

00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:28,180
are a thing right things are gonna go

00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:31,509
wrong

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:33,070
and as we over time we you know learn

00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:35,050
about the different nuances of our

00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:36,759
service we want to keep a record of what

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,399
we've tried that can help resolve these

00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,750
common issues so in an ideal world will

00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,399
know all these things and there's all

00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,810
the known knowns and if off spot was

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,069
here he'd be yelling at me like crazy

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,600
right now when I just said you could

00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:48,579
predict anything because you know what

00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:52,389
you can't and this is the problem with

00:11:48,579 --> 00:11:54,670
run books you need to be able to ensure

00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,740
that you are updating them regularly

00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:59,410
because when you make changes to your

00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:01,959
service the things you do yesterday are

00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,420
different if you don't have the ability

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,459
to keep your run books up-to-date you

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:08,709
should consider abandoning that run book

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:10,660
altogether because an out-of-date run

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:14,860
book is considered harmful it can cause

00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,850
more harm than good work at pager duty

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,740
you might care a little bit about

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,540
alerting so here's the deal right you

00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:21,220
want to only alert on things that are

00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,540
actionable this is how you keep people

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,370
from getting burned out there's nothing

00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,779
more annoying than getting that page of

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:27,819
duty alert at 3:30 in the morning about

00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:30,399
something you can't do about right

00:12:27,819 --> 00:12:31,990
that's not helpful and it also leads us

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,180
to normalization of deviance where we

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,769
start ignoring alerts so I'm gonna dig a

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,860
little bit more into how that alerting

00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:40,510
works in a couple slides and you might

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,089
think that your sustainability group is

00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,980
there to help ensure resiliency of your

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:47,139
service well how many people were here

00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,730
for the ignites yesterday right how many

00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:50,740
people know that John disagrees with us

00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:52,180
and he's not wrong the things we think

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:54,970
about from a sustainability perspective

00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:56,139
are not about resiliency we might think

00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:57,910
more about robustness and reliability

00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:59,050
but these are things where they think

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,600
about high availability

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,699
you know disaster recovery the things

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,990
that are the things we can predict that

00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,850
we know this is a thing that could

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,620
happen we were talking about robustness

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,260
and reliability and your sustainability

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,240
groups are really good at this I used to

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,439
say that good sis admins are all cynics

00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,350
because their job is to think of

00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:19,120
everything that might possibly go wrong

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:20,649
I think about program management hey

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,480
well we just had like a pretty you know

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:24,399
awesome kind of thinking about this so

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,509
I'm not gonna go too deep but I don't

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,439
really have to go back and explain it

00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:30,310
all but I had a great lead-in so right

00:13:28,439 --> 00:13:32,110
but the thing is there's an element of

00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,100
unpredictability in service ownership

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,840
right

00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,760
and so when you think about the outcomes

00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:38,800
that come from our post incident reviews

00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:42,760
or a post mortems proactive maintenance

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,200
so program management can help think

00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,870
about being mindful of the buffer that

00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:50,410
we need for that kind of additional work

00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:52,060
and you know maybe you call this project

00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,650
management it's okay you don't have to

00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:55,720
feel bad about yourself it's alright I'm

00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,640
not judging but and not every

00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,260
organization as we know has has program

00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:00,520
management but these are some of the

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,970
things they can think about they're

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,810
helpful to understand what done means

00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:07,240
understanding things about the having

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:09,430
emotional awareness on the stress of the

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,020
team from other factors and thinking

00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,000
about that connective tissue between

00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,380
different teams and features and what

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,690
does it mean to pull people away from

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,040
other initiatives and then we think

00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:21,340
about product these things are pretty

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,750
closely aligned so the thing is product

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,270
owners are thinking about translating

00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:26,950
the requirements of customers beyond

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,240
what something looks like it is capable

00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:30,310
of right

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,200
customers will tell product owners about

00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:33,820
what they want a product to do but

00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:36,340
they're rarely they're rarely are going

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,560
to specifically ask for things around

00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,810
uptime performance or security in an

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,730
interview or user forum and by that I

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,580
mean they're not going to use those

00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,930
words but they want it and they're gonna

00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,970
ask for it right

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,950
because without uptime a customer can't

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,750
get to that new wonderful feature that

00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:55,000
you've delivered without performance

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:57,010
they're gonna leave in frustration our

00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,560
CEO likes to say that slow is the new

00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:00,760
down right performance matters and

00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,770
without security they sure as hell

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,320
aren't gonna trust that new feature and

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:07,450
speaking of CEOs senior leadership

00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,940
actually has a pretty important part to

00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,280
play and service ownership and this

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:14,230
model works best when it's championed by

00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,840
your top leadership and is consistent

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:19,840
across product and engineering right so

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,910
leaders they help set goals to balance

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,400
business priorities they have to make

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,070
room in their roadmaps for investing in

00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,130
tech debt and kind of driving a culture

00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,780
of cooperation and sharing so let's go a

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:35,350
little bit into some specific things

00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,510
right so this service that we're

00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:40,330
building and developing and iterating on

00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:42,130
what are we observing about it what are

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,190
we noticing about it what are we paying

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,690
attention to so and usually at this

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,940
point I like to kind of talk about

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:51,250
observability versus monitoring we talk

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,199
about both of those things and that

00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,449
itself is a whole talk in itself and you

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,279
know what you kind of saw it yesterday

00:15:54,449 --> 00:16:00,759
so I'm not going to go too deep but

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,139
here's a really great analogy from from

00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:03,910
Liz about the difference between

00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:06,730
observability and monitoring by the way

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:08,410
you need both of these things but as Liz

00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:10,810
says monitoring is when your bank tells

00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,949
you that you're overdrawn observability

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,000
lets you know you're running out of

00:16:11,949 --> 00:16:14,949
money because you're spending too much

00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,110
money on chocolate and sweets and candy

00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:19,870
because you recorded data on what you've

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:23,680
spent all your money on this felt it hit

00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:25,329
a little too home for me personally and

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,149
along those lines I like to think about

00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:29,980
this idea of empathy driven alerting you

00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:32,980
want to focus on the customer experience

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,319
what are the key business metrics around

00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,670
the experience of your customers and if

00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:38,949
this part of the talk isn't enough

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,720
honeycomb fanboying for you here's the

00:16:38,949 --> 00:16:43,360
third reference I'm gonna make which is

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,949
charity majors who loves to say it nines

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:49,329
don't matter if your customers aren't

00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:51,519
happy and again I could we can have an

00:16:49,329 --> 00:16:53,319
entire talk about SL O's and SL A's and

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,939
SL IDEs in fact there was one last year

00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,980
here at devoxx Days New York from Alex

00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:59,110
but I'm gonna make a quick reference

00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,250
because I want to make a point so these

00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,470
are the different if you're not familiar

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,329
and SLI is a service level indicator

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,400
these are specific things that we are

00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:10,000
measuring when they may be things like

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,709
latency or throughput they are not goals

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,360
but they are what are the measure what

00:17:11,709 --> 00:17:15,429
does the dial look like that we're

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,049
defining and then we talk about a

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,360
service level objective and these are

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:21,520
made up of SL eyes they're measured over

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,980
time and then these are not

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,449
contractually set these are objectives

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:27,100
these are the ones that are

00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:28,299
contractually set these are the ones

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,720
that when you break them you owe your

00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:34,390
customer money right so where do you

00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,740
think we want to alert I like to say

00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:37,870
first of all you want to alert on your

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,340
SLO is not your SLA x' because you don't

00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,960
want to be alerted when you break an SLA

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,330
cuz it's a little too late at that point

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,450
so you want to alert and think about

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,070
where to set your SLO s and this is

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,900
something that I accidentally came up

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,580
with as a term with dr. Jennifer

00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,169
putt-off was the editor of the SRA book

00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,090
and we call it the happiness point and

00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:56,649
this is the inflection between customer

00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:58,520
happiness and customer sadness where

00:17:56,649 --> 00:18:01,040
they directly meet and

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,590
is where you set your SLO because if you

00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,090
set it too tight you're gonna be alerted

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,130
when your customers are still happy and

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:08,660
you've wasted a little bit of time if

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,030
you set it a little too loose

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,560
you've got sad customers by the time

00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,970
you're being alerted so you want to find

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,920
this hat in this point and this is a

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:18,890
technical term and it will be in a book

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,840
by O'Reilly maybe well probably not but

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,730
I'm speaking of Alex from last year he's

00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,040
got a book about us Lozano Riley book

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:27,050
coming so again you want to alert on the

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,180
SLO this is when you have page where you

00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:31,880
wake you up when you're hitting an SLO

00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:34,190
and think a little bit about how do you

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,010
want a team to respond to this service

00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:39,260
two issues with this service right you

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,000
want to think about as you're as you're

00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,700
observing this information how do we

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,320
continue to tune it and look for

00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,850
patterns are we seeing consistence and

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,670
this is where your post incident reports

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,130
become really key to say are we seeing

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,100
similar patterns in consumption of the

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,870
service and incidents related to it

00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,690
always be happy to prune your alerts

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,760
right if you alert on five things and

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,190
you understand all five of those things

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,590
equally that's pretty fair if you alert

00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,750
on a thousand things and you treat each

00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:10,220
of those with equal priority it's

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,680
unlikely that any of them are getting

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,900
the priority that they truly need so

00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,480
always always and this is why you do

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,980
post mortems and PIR s even on things

00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,080
that turned out to not be incidents

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,390
because they're an opportunity to tune

00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,480
your alerting you want to suppress

00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:28,310
non-actionable alerts right work with

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,170
your alerting tool to think about ways

00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:33,140
that you can suppress these non

00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:34,550
actionable alerts here pager Duty has a

00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:36,380
feature that does this I'm just saying

00:19:34,550 --> 00:19:38,810
right maybe I'd say go check it out at

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,880
the booth but you can't anyway think

00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:43,190
about the business impact do you know

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:46,400
how your company makes money if you

00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:48,500
don't go find out we'll wait right how

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,120
does this service tie to your customers

00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,430
into your revenue and to the things you

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,710
need to deliver do you understand the

00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:58,100
business metrics connected to this

00:19:54,710 --> 00:20:00,080
service and to kind of wrap this up

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,760
we're going to review the stages of the

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,680
lifecycle that a service might go

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,170
through and where all those things we

00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,370
just talked about fit into that right so

00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,080
when we think about designing a new

00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,630
service this is the fun part right this

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:12,500
is that Greenfield white piece of paper

00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:15,080
start

00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:16,970
from scratch right so the couple of

00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,070
things to think about you need to

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:20,420
understand your customers product is

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,090
great for this your product team is

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,860
great for this making sure that your

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:26,270
sustainability teams are involved as

00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,710
early as possible because they're

00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,540
thinking about things that you might not

00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,210
be thinking about in this great green

00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:34,070
and bright sky blue sky world you want

00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,600
to start thinking about what those SLO s

00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:37,640
and SL eyes are as early as possible

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,990
because that helps you tie them not to

00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,610
the tech and now we think when we're

00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,020
maintaining and iterating now we're

00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:47,090
moving this is where we spend most of

00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:50,300
our life right continuing because

00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:52,370
services are never done so we talked

00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:53,990
about versioning the API this is really

00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,270
key and this is where it matters because

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:58,340
you want to be able to move forward

00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,660
without breaking your customers and you

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,490
need to be able to communicate to them

00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:04,070
and have a method and a methodology on

00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:06,170
which you share these changes right

00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,760
continually address tech debt I mean

00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,530
Dave gave us a great ignite about that

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,550
this morning so that's awesome also know

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,280
this morning I remember we need to

00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:15,200
ignite sir um and then but the thing is

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,740
eventually all good things come to an

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,950
end

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,900
and when we retire a service we talk

00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,730
first about deprecating that service and

00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,170
then Sun setting and deprecating is

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,360
usually when we say it's still around

00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:28,100
we're not fixing it anymore we're not

00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,630
we're not iterating we're not improving

00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,040
it but we don't want to just pull the

00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,330
plug on it right away and leave our

00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,970
customers in the dust

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,290
so we might deprecated first so - but

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,180
our to go through this we need to be

00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:40,670
able to identify the consumers of this

00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,740
service and this is where your customers

00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:44,390
success and your support teams can

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:45,740
actually help you with this a lot they

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:47,120
might know folks that are paying money

00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,010
for this service you want to get rid of

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,960
so you want to figure out what the

00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:52,220
business impact of doing that is how's

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,290
that gonna impact some of your customers

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,760
and you want to be able to communicate

00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,930
and off-board them and the most

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,960
important thing is give them an

00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:02,090
alternative give them a migration path

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,250
don't just say okay we're turning this

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,770
thing off in two weeks so hope you don't

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,030
mind that doesn't go SuperDuper well I

00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:10,850
might think of some products that do
