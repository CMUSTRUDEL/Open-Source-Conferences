Description: 
	Why Events & People Matter: How the new girl used devopsdays to bring the fun to her workplace.

What do you do when you’re the newest, last girl standing, and the future of an event series depends on you? At the top of 2019, I was a 6 month old contractor at Verizon with no idea what I was in for. I was content to do commendable work in the background - using my voice to write for our engineer-facing website. I’d get to know our engineers in interviews as they returned from industry conferences. I thought this was as close as I’d get to events, but before I knew it, there was a retiree & Tech Day (Verizon’s adaptation of devopsday) knocking on my door. The rest was history & the adventure ahead was more than had bargained for in the best way. In this talk, I will share how I sought ways to deliver on the culture change that Verizon GTS had been asking for by keeping calm & sprinkling enthusiasm around like glitter. How - over the course of 3 historical events in 1 year, with an awesome planning team, & a few risks, Verizon Tech Day pulled an exceptional NPS score & drew an SRO audience at our last event in 2019 - a 255% increase in attendance (and excitement)! Last, even better for me, right smack in the middle of this journey, I was hired :)

hello everyone

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,180
[Applause]

00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,280
hi so I come from Verizon I've been at

00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,440
Verizon for one year as a contractor in

00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:28,790
nine months as an employee I get to put

00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,980
on some pretty cool events for our

00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,870
developers and our technologists so

00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:34,989
that's how I am here for you two all for

00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:37,130
you all today so I have a quick question

00:00:34,989 --> 00:00:39,530
why do you all show up to these things

00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,680
you did it today you came out of your

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,660
homes and you made it to DevOps say what

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,900
makes you show up is it the free food is

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:51,339
it the inspiration are you here because

00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:54,019
you want to be in networking with other

00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:55,820
technologists the questions and the

00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:58,580
answers are so important to people like

00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,199
me people like event planners and

00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,940
community organizers who want to make

00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:03,800
sure you get the best bang for your buck

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:06,440
and the best experience for your time

00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,330
these events are essentially for you I

00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,250
want to talk about how you feel when you

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,140
show up and how DevOps is the best part

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,840
of what I had to work I started my

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,820
journey in 2019 when a retiree handed

00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,110
over Verizon tech days to me it's a

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,180
series just like this

00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:21,890
DevOps day but it's our internal event

00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,960
usually I'm running around with the

00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:26,000
volunteers or looking for late speakers

00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,280
but when it's all in motion it's a

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,360
beauty to behold days like these we are

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,040
learning from each other our

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,380
technologists are sharing their

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,240
inspiration their innovations their

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,070
strategies failures discoveries the

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,380
whole nine we even get to hear from

00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,910
external luminaries like yourselves but

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,890
for event planners I see these as

00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,750
parties for the people reasons why

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,790
people get to step away from their desk

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,880
break out of the silo and make sure

00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,600
they're just being human and enjoying

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,450
having a great time

00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,660
so what makes a good event to you all

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,030
what Rallos you away from your seat what

00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:00,710
rallies anyone around a good event it's

00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:03,200
not just the tip of the iceberg it's

00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,200
everything underneath I had to rely on

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,300
DevOps principles to expand on a model

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,759
that was handed to me at the top of 2019

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,250
so the first DevOps principle that I was

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:15,170
able to implement was product mindset

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,700
with tech day being the product our

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:18,470
attendees were the customers what did

00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:19,129
the people need in one what were they

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,870
looking for

00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,910
what were they what was the climate at

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,440
the company we couldn't just cookie cut

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,900
a model we had to make sure we were

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,670
taking in their rapid feedback we had to

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,049
implement surveys at the end of every

00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,280
event and say hey what are you guys

00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:33,470
looking for how did you feel

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,390
we had to ask questions for the answers

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:37,270
we actually saw it you'd be surprised

00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:40,100
that the squeaky wheel does get the oil

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:41,990
we had to continuously improve

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,970
I bet this DevOps day is better than

00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,950
last year's DevOps day because that's

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,200
what we do as event planners we are

00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:50,630
obsessed with iteration and making sure

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:53,630
we just don't create from the old but we

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,640
create new models so like Maya Angelou

00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:58,040
says if I know to do better I've got to

00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,590
do better it was time to update the

00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:03,790
playbook and expand our best practices

00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,890
to transform culture one risk at a time

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:09,110
so I wanted to start off with remix in

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:11,300
the Golden Rule I wanted to treat people

00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:13,459
how I wanted them to treat the event by

00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:15,019
remaining calm under pressure being very

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,209
thankful and kind to everyone

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,000
normalizing kindness I felt like the

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:22,160
volunteers were being happy then the

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,590
event would be happy so that was the

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,190
first one the second way we wanted to

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,590
update a best practice was to look at in

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,780
turn being intentional about inclusivity

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,400
and diversity we wanted not just the men

00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,500
to speak but the women to speak as well

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,030
not just junior leaders or not just

00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,190
senior leaders but our junior leaders as

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,930
well we also had to give the people

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:43,790
exactly what they wanted when they were

00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,600
saying that talks are too long or there

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,090
are too many of them

00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,000
I heard give us more ways and reasons to

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,700
engage so we added networking receptions

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,010
games contest prizes raffles the whole

00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:57,769
nine even photo booths another best

00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:59,870
practice was to make sure I took every

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,060
opportunity to upgrade the event so I

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,829
even I changed the agenda paper to like

00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,750
a better type and people waving it

00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:07,609
around saying great paper but balloons

00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,310
are another nonverbal cue that

00:04:07,609 --> 00:04:12,170
celebration is nearby so lots of them we

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:13,549
also had to bring on the hot topics my

00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,980
director thought it'd be really cool to

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:18,560
talk failure and everyone was like what

00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,690
why but when leadership bought in and

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,580
they were very transparent it ended up

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,770
being our most historical event and we

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,320
had standing room only so the result of

00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,510
our DevOps press practices we had our

00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,039
highest net promoter score of 77 by the

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,360
end of the year we had a two hundred

00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,550
fifty five percent increase in

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,050
attendance by the end of the year the IT

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:38,750
leader said this is the new standard for

00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:40,970
Verizon tech days and it was just great

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,620
so I want to say that I believe the

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:44,510
people drove the change they wanted to

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,050
see when they showed up as watch party

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,539
host

00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,610
volunteers as speakers learners leaders

00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:52,370
even people who just responded to the

00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:54,409
survey they saw their contributions and

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,870
they were they were saying that hey we

00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:58,849
like what we showed up to so my ass to

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,800
you is bring it when you hear about

00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:04,039
cultural change at your organization or

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,780
opportunity to make something great you

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:07,520
can play a part from the front door to

00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:09,740
the front floor to make anything greater

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,659
I want to say that you drive and you

00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,000
create the momentum and the lifespan of

00:05:11,659 --> 00:05:16,849
anything and he cause any initiative at

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,919
your companies and so make sure to show

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,020
up to them it's the people who make

00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,710
events matter and that's why we all keep

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,470
showing up thank you

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:38,769
[Applause]

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:38,769
