Title: devopsdaysNYC 2020 - Day 1 - John Allspaw - Can Resilience Eng be sufficiently described in 5 mins?
Publication date: 2020-03-30
Playlist: DevOpsDays NYC 2020
Description: 
	Can Resilience Engineering be sufficiently described in 5 minutes?

Of course the answer to the question in the title is “no” because this twenty-year old multidisciplinary field is as broad and deep as Distributed Systems. Bringing perspectives, methods, and concepts from Resilience Engineering is a long game; my goal is to whet your appetite and lay down enough compelling threads for you to pull on as this important long game unfolds.

	00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,320
so when we think about incidence in

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,540
software we tend to think about looking

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,550
at of them closely and as a way to

00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,830
understand and sort of prevent them from

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,110
happening we want less incidents and

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,430
that's what we're generally thinking

00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:34,920
about when we think about them

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,629
especially with post-mortems but follow

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,120
me here for a moment what if we were to

00:00:36,629 --> 00:00:43,519
look a lot closely at what happens when

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:49,110
incidents are not occurring and try to

00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:51,059
maximise or increase that so this is a

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,129
key concept from this field called

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,979
resilience engineering my entire goal of

00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,750
this talk is to get at least a couple of

00:00:55,979 --> 00:01:01,650
you to come want to talk to me later

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,180
about it that's it so the first thing I

00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,040
want you to understand about resilience

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,670
engineering is it's a field

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,500
it's a twenty-year-old multidisciplinary

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,570
field has a number of different

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,070
influences a number of different from

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:20,399
angles to it from all sort of different

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:22,859
scientific domains the second is that

00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:27,119
it's a community a number of the domains

00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:29,039
that you see here all have have sort of

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,859
paths into resilience engineering and

00:01:29,039 --> 00:01:34,890
they all have high consequence high

00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,590
tempo work environments now you'll note

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,909
that I've got this sort of new indicator

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,030
on software engineering because it's

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,880
important I think for us all to

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,820
understand that R is that software world

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,859
is brand new to resilience engineering

00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,259
only in the last couple of years so to

00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,810
dispel some notions resilience is really

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,369
nothing about computers or software even

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,439
though we say that it's not about

00:01:56,369 --> 00:01:59,700
redundancy or robustness or high

00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:01,950
availability fault tolerance it's not

00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,030
even about chaos it's not chaos

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:09,780
engineering although it's related its

00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:12,569
activities to sustain adaptation we have

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,630
to adapt and we're constantly adapting

00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,430
whether we notice it or not in the

00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:20,970
people and the teams that are doing this

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:22,819
work resilience plays out in the events

00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,930
that are unforeseen unanticipated

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:27,360
fundamentally surprising and this is

00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,850
something I want to really sort of

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,000
drive home for you what does it mean to

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,550
be fundamentally surprising well so if

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,780
you imagine a lottery ticket many of us

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:39,690
who might buy a lottery ticket are not

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,730
going to win but a situational surprise

00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,950
is where you buy a ticket and you win

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,890
the lottery it with it's within the

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,680
realm that you can imagine a fundamental

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:53,940
surprise is when you win the lottery and

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,910
you don't buy a ticket okay it is not

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,640
even within the realm of potential in

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,250
your mind forget about looking for signs

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:05,280
that it could happen okay and this is

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,140
really important our ability to handle

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,690
fundamental surprises they happen all

00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,540
the time they're just not very dramatic

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,220
you all have experience with this

00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:18,320
resilience our proactive activities

00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:22,020
aimed at preparing to be unprepared in

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,030
that way resilience this is the good

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,590
news is already happening and it's

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,400
present in your organization the

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:31,530
difficulty is that it's hard to see it's

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,160
hard to characterize it's hard to

00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:38,010
identify but in an example in the wild

00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:41,040
if I can we continually invest in an

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:44,459
ability to deploy not to deploy but the

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,380
ability deploy if we need to because

00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:49,230
it's needed for handling fundamental

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,630
surprises we have automated tests and

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,840
peer code review feature flags all of

00:03:51,630 --> 00:04:00,450
these things that you see cannot be

00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:02,570
justified economically beforehand it is

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,519
the audacity of doing that that

00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:08,190
continues to keep our abilities fresh

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,930
there is a valid complaint that

00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,239
resilience engineering because it's a

00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,450
lot of its described in academic

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,320
journals there's two academic I say

00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:20,310
 you all can do the work

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,140
understanding resilience engineering

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:25,860
just like understanding distributed

00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,630
systems will take time the concepts with

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,660
resilience engineering are not intuitive

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:34,590
they flip your mind around but they're

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,810
also critically important I will say

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,060
this this is happening there are those

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:41,310
who are making effort when there's a

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,560
conference redeploy

00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:46,290
there are people in our industry who are

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,290
furthering their own education degrees

00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,960
and online dialogues are happening the

00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:54,840
next talk that I want you to see on this

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,139
topic is this one I'll I'll tweet the

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,910
link there's a number of different

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:01,500
threads that you all should pull on just

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,900
realize it's going to take some time

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,900
it's gonna take some time to sort of

00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:09,630
grok this I've put up a couple of URLs

00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,610
for you to read and learn more

00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:13,770
especially from the people who are

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,870
really putting in the time and effort to

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,530
sort of understand and connect with this

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,910
community

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,900
thank you

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:35,199
[Applause]
