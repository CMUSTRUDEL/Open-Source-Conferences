Description: 
	Keeping Calm When the Sky is Falling: Reducing Stress around Software Incidents

Many of us have experienced at least one big outage of services we’re responsible for, and it’s never a fun experience. With customers, executives and other teams all yelling at the same time, it’s easy to freak out and not know where to begin.

Many industries have discovered that if you have nothing else, having a plan and working together will allow cool heads to prevail and reliably follow the steps needed to get back up and running quickly.

This talk will provide you with tales of practices that can help your organization handle incidents effectively, and get more of your people involved to reduce the burden and bottlenecks.

	00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:19,840
good morning so I'm going to be talking

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,119
to you today about what happens when

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,420
your pile of tech debt falls over

00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:27,070
spectacularly more importantly I'm going

00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,529
to talk about how we can reduce the

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,480
stress that is so often associated with

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:34,120
incidents strangers for myself my name

00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,550
is Tom I'm an engineering lead next we

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,110
help our clients deliver brand verified

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,210
answers to their customers wherever they

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,610
ask on the web and we've had an incident

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,809
response process for about two years now

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:47,320
which has been working pretty well for

00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:48,880
us I think we've all been here something

00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,520
goes wrong with your app or your website

00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:53,170
and everyone starts yelling the

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,700
customers start yelling at the account

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,290
managers the account managers start

00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,730
yelling at these software engineers and

00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:59,530
the software engineers start yelling at

00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,719
each other trying to spread the blame

00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,700
around everyone starts freaking out and

00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,350
nobody's talking to anyone else no one's

00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,580
really getting anything done or if they

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:08,380
are they're not saying that they're

00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:10,240
getting anything done and you don't

00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:12,180
reach a conclusion or when you do you

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,170
don't know how you reach that conclusion

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,660
everyone has a horrible time that people

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:21,130
start resigning okay let's breathe we're

00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,319
gonna talk about how to make this less

00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:28,030
stressful we're at the Academy of

00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:29,830
Medicine the healing starts here so I'd

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,050
like to tell you a story about this guy

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:34,330
Chris Hadfield the first Canadian

00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,770
astronaut to walk in space and a veteran

00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:38,410
of the space shuttle and the

00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:40,780
International Space Station now a few

00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:43,390
years ago he was on a spacewalk and some

00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,399
defog in solution from his visor got

00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:48,069
into his eye

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,410
this caused his eye to water and because

00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:53,709
he was in microgravity the tears didn't

00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:56,229
stream they pulled over his eye this

00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:59,800
spread to his second eye and he was

00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:02,259
blinded imagine that you're 300 miles

00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:06,959
above the surface of the earth and you

00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:09,789
are blind terrifying but he stayed calm

00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,610
not because he's naturally a cool calm

00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:15,250
and collected individual but because he

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,770
had a plan and he knew what to do and he

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,050
knew he could rely on these people he

00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,610
radios down to Mission Control and they

00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:25,810
work together to come up with a solution

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:28,200
so they tell him vent the air from your

00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,200
suit

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:35,440
and he did it and it worked and he did

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,510
that without question because he knew

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,290
that he could trust these people with

00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,599
his life

00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,630
they'd practiced this again and again

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,950
and again not this exact problem but

00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,769
they knew what to do when things went

00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:50,950
wrong so now I'd like to talk about a

00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:53,769
well handled software incident I'm not

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,989
interested in that what people are doing

00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,549
I'm more interested in the why so I'm

00:02:55,989 --> 00:02:59,739
going to be highlighting some guidelines

00:02:57,549 --> 00:03:02,349
how you can respond well to an incident

00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:03,610
as a team this is stuff we do it yext

00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:05,709
but I'm going to use a fictionalized

00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,989
example of a nice commerce company with

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:09,700
these lovely people here who are product

00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:13,739
managers engineers and Thecla deeds and

00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,959
also part-time stock photo models

00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,610
something goes wrong with the order page

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,530
Alice notices and there were no alerts

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,049
fired so she knows she can raise an

00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,510
incident anyone can raise an incident to

00:03:23,049 --> 00:03:26,769
get people involved and get started on

00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,200
solving the problem as quickly as

00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:31,299
possible this goes into a public

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,299
incidents channel that everyone can see

00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,489
and people come in and inform everyone

00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:38,410
of what they're doing Alice takes over

00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:41,500
as incident commander and brings on Bob

00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:43,540
as lead resolver they work together to

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,260
figure out a change that probably caused

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:46,090
the problem

00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,180
and the first thing that they do is

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,160
mitigate they rollback that change to

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,810
get into a good state make your

00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,420
customers happy as soon as possible

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,609
because this gives you time to fix the

00:03:55,420 --> 00:04:00,130
problem properly without worrying too

00:03:57,609 --> 00:04:02,260
much about it or rushing well once Bob's

00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:03,940
got is fixed in this isn't the end of

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,639
the story they need to learn something

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:08,410
so Carol goes off and writes up a

00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,780
post-mortem doc with action items that

00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,180
improve both the software and the

00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:15,670
processes and they follow up to make

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,700
sure that these are actioned most

00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:21,250
importantly they practice a lot they do

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:23,169
regular drills of fail overs they get

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,240
junior engineers to shadow senior

00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:27,220
engineers during incidents and they do

00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,680
simulated incidents so people can

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:32,500
practice in a safe environment so to

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,510
reiterate anyone can trigger an incident

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,760
keep everyone informed as to what's

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:39,159
going on mitigate the problem before

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,270
working on the fix learn something from

00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:44,590
the experience

00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:46,480
and practice practice practice so

00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,190
there's a lot more about incident

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,140
response I would definitely recommend

00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,180
these site reliability engineering book

00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:54,700
from Google particularly chapters 12 to

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,650
15 this is what we based our process on

00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:59,440
and most importantly it's free which is

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,370
awesome so I'd like to thank you for

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,870
your time if anyone does have any

00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,160
questions please feel free to find me

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,370
during a break I would love to have a

00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,120
chat thank you

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:21,419
[Applause]
