00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,540
fantastic conference everyone's thinking

00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:54,610
why does Facebook come to DevOps days

00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,990
because we don't really do DevOps and we

00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:57,850
don't hire people with develops job

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:00,220
titles we do we have a thing called

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,080
production engineers we're slightly

00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,850
different to the regular DevOps sre

00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,800
thing we get involved with the software

00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,750
engineers at the start we have about

00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,910
thirty of us in New York at the moment

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,879
and we're looking to expand that by kind

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:16,140
of 20 or so in the next year so come and

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,140
see us upstairs and say hey

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:22,450
thank you thank you it's good to see how

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:26,170
many people here have heard of or use

00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:28,090
get left I started three years ago and

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,310
this room would have been no hands up

00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:31,600
here whatsoever we've had an incredible

00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:34,030
run we've grown over two and a half

00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,950
billion dollars an hour a hundred

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:38,230
million dollars ARR which is pretty

00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,560
amazing for coming and the reason we do

00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:44,620
that you can give two quick examples

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,410
gitlab covers the entire SDLC because we

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,060
make it easier for you just like a few

00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:51,280
years ago we used to have a camera and

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,200
we used to have to download things to an

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,510
SD card and upload it to your computer

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,280
and send it to other people may have to

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,590
download it now I just take a picture

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,750
with my phone and I text it to you right

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,480
we just make the process simpler easier

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,240
better faster for your people same thing

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,270
