Title: devopsdaysNYC 2020 - Day 2 - James Meickle - Cooperative Economics for Engineers

Description: 
	Cooperative Economics for Engineers; or, Why You Have More In Common With Pirate Fleets Than With Your Manager

Tech sector employees have historically had few influential unions, professional societies, or other cooperative entities. 2020 may be the year that changes, thanks to ongoing labor disputes such as public awareness of game developer working conditions, walkouts at Google protesting inequity and sexual harassment, and the recent collective bargaining victories at “new media” establishments.

Most programmers work under better conditions, but dig beyond the surface and there are still some uncomfortable questions. Why are stock options deliberately misleading? Why isn’t there standard on-call compensation? Why is on-the-job training so limited? Why are programmers over 30 considered old? Why are tech companies so interested in outsourcing, offshoring, and even prison labor?

We need more context to answer some of these uncomfortable questions. Let’s take a lightning-speed tour through the history of cooperative economics, including medieval guilds, Luddites, ship’s articles, the American labor movement, and worker’s cooperatives. Learn what connects all of these moments in history, and how that very same thread runs through our careers as technologists today. And most importantly, learn why you’re more like a pirate than you ever guessed!

	00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,560
all right good morning everyone thank

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,140
you for coming out to my talk

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,110
cooperative economics for engineers or

00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,580
the subtitle why you have more in common

00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,349
with pirate fleets than with your

00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:30,590
manager which by the way my manager

00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:32,570
absolutely loved that title just as a

00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:34,340
Content warning this talk is going to

00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:36,379
include some discussions of violence

00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:38,809
slavery and racism it also has some

00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:40,430
historical document photos so if you're

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:42,790
going to have a problem with that and

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,600
now would be a great time to walk out

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,030
I'm not gonna be taking questions

00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,920
instead I'm going to do an open space

00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:54,289
afterwards so I'll also be tweeting the

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,629
links and slides my twitter handle is on

00:00:54,289 --> 00:00:58,699
the slides themselves also I believe

00:00:56,629 --> 00:01:01,399
this is being recorded so if there's

00:00:58,699 --> 00:01:03,980
video to be up later final set of

00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:05,810
bookkeeping so I work in finance I have

00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,250
to have these disclaimers please do not

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:12,500
take investment advice from a

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:15,350
presentation about pirates all right so

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,330
I'm James I'm a senior essary at quanto

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,400
peon in the finance space I do a lot of

00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:23,659
work with Python but the start's not

00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,729
really about what I do at work this

00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:26,900
talks actually about Labor and before I

00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:29,780
start talking about labor I want to ask

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:32,750
a quick question who has a laptop with

00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,009
stickers on it that looks like this okay

00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,409
that's like a pretty sizable number

00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,299
raise your hand really high if you have

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,810
stickers like this and one of them is a

00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:46,340
union sticker I don't see a single hand

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,020
in the audience and why is that because

00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,610
if you go look at a construction site

00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,290
right on their hard hats they do the

00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:52,970
same sticker sort of thing but most of

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,380
them are union stickers it's pretty

00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,020
standard you'd be surprised if you

00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:02,770
didn't see one

00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:07,119
but in 2019 tech was at a place where oh

00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:07,119
I'm sorry what am i walking

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:19,370
[Music]

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:26,870
that doesn't seem to be but move it up

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:28,879
there alright so in 2019 almost no tech

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,299
workers like our part of a union or

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,189
identify as part of organized labor or

00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:36,620
really have any like ownership or stake

00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,689
in their companies but that night race

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,340
really started to change in 2019 people

00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:43,879
started to take a serious interest in

00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:47,959
this we saw a lot of walkouts from game

00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:50,900
companies at Google actually Google they

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,700
had to have the NLRB step in and say hey

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,079
you can't tell your employees to stop

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,269
talking about unions at work they have a

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:59,000
right to do this

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:01,639
and sometimes that retaliation got

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,129
pretty aggressive NPM had this situation

00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:06,349
where some employees were trying to form

00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:08,689
a union and they were retaliated against

00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:10,549
and that actually led to not just those

00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,750
employees but also a lot of other

00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:13,250
employees who weren't part of the

00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,269
initial effort leaving because they

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,269
didn't like to see that retaliation

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,500
we're also seeing this in some areas

00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:23,510
adjacent attack so of course a lot of

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,609
folks here would identify as engineers

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,099
our people are writing code but it's

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:31,069
also people who work at more new media

00:03:28,099 --> 00:03:35,569
establishments so tech adjacent some of

00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:42,079
them have started unionizing oh guy

00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:42,919
loose slides and I think I'm at a lost

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:45,290
Internet here

00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:50,019
should have an export first well I won't

00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:54,199
make do so it's also spilled over into

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:55,669
sort of popular society where this was

00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:58,370
really when we started to see a lot of

00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,810
backlash against big tech against the

00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:01,069
working conditions at those companies

00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,739
and against the contracts that they're

00:04:01,069 --> 00:04:10,189
taking on so Cambridge analytic a clear

00:04:03,739 --> 00:04:13,040
view AI what Palantir has been doing yep

00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:17,690
what Palantir has been doing working

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,190
with ice directly as well as the support

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,419
that Amazon has been providing for these

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,130
companies these are all things that

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:23,479
really made the news that a lot of

00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:26,699
people are talking about

00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:28,620
so really the state of 2019 the way it

00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:31,500
ended was that everyone's angry attack

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:34,320
even people in tech are angry attack at

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,820
this point but the question is what are

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,570
people in tech actually going to do

00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,910
about that

00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,650
because to my mind if we just all

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:42,419
started adding Union stickers to our

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,039
laptops and called it a day that

00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:45,870
wouldn't be much of a change would it we

00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,919
already have pretty well-paying jobs

00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,350
pretty steady employments so for me I'm

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,560
a lot more interested in what context do

00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,990
about larger scale problems the way that

00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,979
we interface with society and I think

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,139
we'll have to be a little more creative

00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:03,120
for that and what I think creativity

00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,250
where I like to learn my lessons from

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:10,139
one of the major places that I do is

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,610
actually history so I could start here

00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,030
with this guy cuz you know organized

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,240
labor

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,340
that sounds Marxist but I actually want

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:22,139
to start about a thousand years before

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:23,340
him or ten minutes from now so we're

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:26,940
actually gonna start in the Middle Ages

00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:29,190
in Europe this is a time after the fall

00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,139
of the Roman Empire this is a time with

00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,419
a lot of chaos and disruption and people

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,250
are looking for stability so they start

00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:38,970
to invent this new social order that we

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,310
call feudalism and people in the social

00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,620
order it's got a king on top the nobles

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:47,159
underneath that Knights to help enforce

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,680
that rule and peasants at the bottom and

00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:51,360
some of these peasants are called serfs

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,220
they're actually bought and sold with

00:05:51,360 --> 00:06:03,120
the land they're sort of like a form of

00:05:53,220 --> 00:06:07,080
slavery okay okay

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:09,270
so these serfs are you know the lowest

00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,889
of the low but not every peasant is like

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,380
that some of these peasants are actually

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,120
skilled craftspeople

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:16,830
and as the Middle Ages go on they start

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,210
to be really successful they start

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,010
making a lot of money and they become

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:24,389
what's effectively the middle class of

00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:27,300
that era they would become members of

00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:31,770
guilds and in modern terms a guild would

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:34,380
be essentially a union shop you have you

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,539
have a group of folks who are

00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,949
pulling the resources together who are

00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:39,360
training each other often from a young

00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:42,870
age so you might have gotten started in

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,460
your guild at 12 or 14 years old and

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,389
these guilds are local institutions

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,530
because they don't just provide

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:48,419
on-the-job training they're also

00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,220
providing benefits they're making sure

00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:52,289
that you have like a minimum set of

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:54,840
compensation they're making sure that

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:59,880
you your family gets taken care of if

00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:11,729
you get sick can we just leave this with

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:14,840
the bar okay thank you yeah that's

00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,840
better thank you

00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:20,120
so these guilds craftspeople they're

00:07:17,789 --> 00:07:23,580
working together on these collaborations

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,380
and they're producing higher quality

00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,389
goods so it's actually a really

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,070
successful system it's really stable and

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,050
when you're producing higher quality

00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,190
goods you want to be able to trade using

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,139
the mark of that guilt

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:35,970
so you mark your goods as being from a

00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:39,060
particular guild and you can only do

00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,139
that if they're high enough quality how

00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,699
do they enforce that though because this

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:43,229
is really early in history so it's

00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,810
actually before we had modern court

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:47,820
systems modern police the answer is that

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:49,050
people in a guild would self police they

00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,370
would actually inspect each other's

00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,349
goods make sure it was high enough

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,330
quality the rest of your guild would

00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,889
actually force you to offer rebates for

00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:59,340
inferior quality goods so it was a

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:01,409
self-reinforcing system we saw something

00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,330
similar with the advent of trade so as

00:08:01,409 --> 00:08:05,849
we started seeing more specialization of

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,009
production we saw Goods going longer

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:09,539
distances and when your goods are

00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:10,860
trading a thousand miles from where you

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,800
are that's a high potential that you're

00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:16,229
gonna get ripped off right so these

00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,789
merchants are actually at the same time

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,370
the guilds are running they're inventing

00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,560
a really cool technology that actually

00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,729
is going to drive modern capitalism when

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,900
I say invention you might think

00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:27,840
something like Oh a new shipping

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:31,020
technology right it's actually contract

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,390
law see merchants invented contract law

00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,459
to deal with this situation and again

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,870
this was before we had the modern court

00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,270
system this was before we even had

00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,390
modern nations and what they came up

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,190
with was a peer judged system so it

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:47,070
would be merchants trying the cases of

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,380
other merchants ripping off merchants so

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:57,460
as a

00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:59,110
self-enclosed system Oh so we're coming

00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,880
to the end of the Middle Ages and we

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,410
have these two stable systems that allow

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,870
a lot of like essentially middle class

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:08,470
people to have worker owned and operated

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,820
lines of business so what starts to

00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:13,270
change that we don't really have that

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:15,100
much of that today well one of the

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,370
really big factors is the spread of

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:20,170
colonialism so as you start to have more

00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:22,780
trade people want a slice of that pie

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,700
right so you start to see more borders

00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:26,590
you start to see more expansion and

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:30,040
centralization you see the rise of

00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:32,200
nationalism through this era and all

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:34,840
that starts to centralize control under

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,340
governments so a lot of people were

00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,680
pretty unhappy with us right this

00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:41,350
directly leads to the modern forms of

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:45,460
racism and exploitation the modern forms

00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:48,870
of colonialism so what a lot of people

00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,790
do is they say become a pirate

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,910
see a lot of pirates actually started

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:56,590
out as merchants you gotta have a ship

00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:59,160
to be a pirate right and who has just a

00:09:56,590 --> 00:10:02,230
ship lying around it's mostly merchants

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,270
we also had pirates who were deserters

00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,040
from armies we had pirates who were

00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,740
escaped slaves because this was the

00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,270
height of slavery this era we had

00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,790
pirates who were queer and fleeing their

00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,770
communities so it's actually a really

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,020
really diverse environment on pirate

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,760
ships in this era and it was wrote

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:23,860
called the Golden Age of piracy in this

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,000
era it was really a major trend so how

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:27,280
do these pirates actually all get along

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,710
if they were all so diverse from a bunch

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:31,510
of different backgrounds cramped up on a

00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,250
ship together for months with lots of

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:36,580
swords and guns around like how do they

00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:38,230
not just kill each other well

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,140
they had this cool technology called

00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,690
contract law pirates would actually

00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,100
enter into agreements with each other

00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:46,630
and this was all based on the same sort

00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,180
of agreements that merchant ships would

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:51,040
have this is an actual like merchant

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,900
ship articles of agreement that

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,520
specifies what your salary is going to

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,800
be where you're going to work when

00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:59,380
you're going to go to port just as an

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,089
aside if you read this one closely it is

00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,490
actually going to Providence

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:05,410
and the prior destination is the coast

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:07,389
of Africa so this is a slave ship

00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:14,499
manifest that's a lot of what these

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:17,350
pirates were rating in this era so these

00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:19,540
pirates they need to have this agreement

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:21,189
and they form this pirate code based on

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:24,490
this earlier set of merchant shipping

00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:26,110
agreements and as it turns out these

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:28,209
pirates are basically independent

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,040
contractors right they can join whatever

00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:31,899
ship they want they bring their own gear

00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,649
to it they stay on for as long as they

00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:36,819
want to and then they leave so it

00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:38,259
actually has a lot of parallels to the

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:42,399
modern set of independent contractors

00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:45,309
that we have so what are the benefits of

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,959
pirates of this contracting situation

00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:50,620
well the benefits of the job were

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,120
actually pretty good when you were a

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,129
pirate crew you didn't just get paid

00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,689
your salary so to speak you had bonuses

00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:57,850
every time you got a big share of

00:11:55,689 --> 00:11:59,259
treasure and this bonus is really flat

00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,610
you can see those numbers here

00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,069
yeah the captain's getting like about

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:05,079
twice as much but not two hundred times

00:12:03,069 --> 00:12:08,920
as much two thousand times as much

00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:10,540
Oh the Pirates also had a vote so you

00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:13,600
could vote on what ship you wanted to

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,709
attack what port you wanted to go to so

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,370
that actually made it a very democratic

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:21,279
tradition for the time pirates also had

00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:22,529
disability insurance which is something

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,029
that a lot of people wouldn't expect

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:26,920
this is why we see so many peg legs and

00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,120
eye patches in pirate art right like if

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,350
you got wounded they couldn't just dump

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,889
you in the ocean they have to at least

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,149
let you stick around till you hit port

00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:39,370
also some pirates had some pretty strong

00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:41,519
HR policies so we can compare this with

00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:43,300
modern independent contractors right

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,220
there's nothing actually wrong with

00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,019
being an independent contractor pirates

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:49,360
were and they had it pretty good what's

00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,699
really wrong is what are those

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,309
independent contractors getting offered

00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:56,499
what's the Equality there and what are

00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:58,149
they being represented as because in the

00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:00,819
case of something like lyft or uber they

00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:03,309
don't have nearly as many free choices

00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:04,990
as something like a pirate would they

00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,699
don't really get an equal share and

00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,769
running the business they don't get to

00:13:06,699 --> 00:13:10,600
vote in the same way so to call them

00:13:08,769 --> 00:13:12,499
independent contractors is a definitely

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:17,299
misnomer as California has

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:18,829
decided so at the end of this era we

00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:20,719
start hitting the beginnings of the

00:13:18,829 --> 00:13:22,579
Industrial Revolution so we're actually

00:13:20,719 --> 00:13:25,149
gonna hop back to England and what I

00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:27,559
want to talk about is the Luddites

00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,849
anyone ever called anyone like a Luddite

00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:30,109
before because it's you know it's an

00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,609
insult saying oh you don't know anything

00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:35,299
about technology you're scared of

00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:37,069
technology the Luddites were really

00:13:35,299 --> 00:13:39,139
interesting folks they're actually

00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:40,729
skilled weavers and textile workers

00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:42,919
there would have been the same kind of

00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:45,169
people in medieval guilds and they

00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:46,519
didn't misunderstand technology they

00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:48,409
actually understood technology really

00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,799
well because the technology they were

00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:53,059
afraid of was this it's a computer well

00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,459
it's not really a computer it's a loom

00:13:53,059 --> 00:13:57,559
but as the predecessor to the first

00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:59,719
computer which was never built the

00:13:57,559 --> 00:14:01,299
analytical engine so what Ada Lovelace

00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:04,009
wrote the first computer program for

00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:05,539
because at this time looms were getting

00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:09,019
so sophisticated they could actually

00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:11,379
just do arbitrary computation they could

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,729
really turn projects around very fast

00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:15,619
and the Luddite saw this and they

00:14:13,729 --> 00:14:17,419
realized what would happen they weren't

00:14:15,619 --> 00:14:18,739
actually afraid of a machine taking

00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:20,359
their jobs they were afraid of the

00:14:18,739 --> 00:14:22,249
person who owned the machine taking

00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:24,259
their jobs because it wasn't owned by

00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:26,689
the community it was owned by a private

00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:28,159
industrialist so when these

00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:30,220
industrialists came to cities and

00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,269
started forcing people out of their jobs

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,729
the Luddite started smashing the

00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:38,449
machines so these machines were known as

00:14:34,729 --> 00:14:42,169
stocking frames so these Luddites became

00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:44,179
frame breakers it was very fast that the

00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:45,379
factory owners started retaliating so

00:14:44,179 --> 00:14:47,119
sometimes they would just shoot the

00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:49,549
Luddites coming in and smashing their

00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:51,589
machines they would do it personally but

00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:52,959
actually really started lobbying the

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:55,489
government to do something about this

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,609
the one I have here is a two hundred

00:14:55,489 --> 00:15:00,019
pound reward that was early on towards

00:14:58,609 --> 00:15:02,179
the later era it actually became a

00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:04,639
capital offense to smash one of these

00:15:02,179 --> 00:15:07,429
things they would basically try you the

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,299
same way you would for treason so why is

00:15:07,429 --> 00:15:13,039
that well how many of you know about

00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:14,299
computer crimes legislation if you've

00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,799
heard the story of kevin Mitnick

00:15:14,299 --> 00:15:17,449
essentially getting like banned from

00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:21,349
using the internet because of being a

00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:24,409
hacker DMCA takedowns everything was

00:15:21,349 --> 00:15:26,089
like the DCSS decryption and stuff we

00:15:24,409 --> 00:15:28,069
see these wildly disproportion

00:15:26,089 --> 00:15:29,809
responses against technological crimes

00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:34,360
that to some actually seemed almost

00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:36,439
victimless that's because at that era

00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,449
computers and the Internet were seen as

00:15:36,439 --> 00:15:40,309
a major economic force and that was

00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:41,930
actually true in Britain at the time for

00:15:40,309 --> 00:15:45,980
the textile industry it was the most

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,749
important part of the economy so if we

00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,379
look at something like what happened

00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:53,930
last year taking down the some of the

00:15:51,379 --> 00:15:57,079
chef's packages in response to their

00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:58,430
ongoing contract with ice well you could

00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:00,709
see that as essentially a form of

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,029
industrial sabotage right and the

00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:03,319
history of that has actually been that

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:05,839
there's been wildly disproportionate

00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,089
punishment because it's seen as critical

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,699
to the economic success of some nation

00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:12,139
so it's actually really interesting

00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:13,970
historically that this isn't something

00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,370
you can get in trouble for revoking some

00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,809
license that that's actually a pretty

00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:21,860
new development and it's really

00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:23,180
unprecedented historically and I'd

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,730
actually say we shouldn't expect it to

00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,980
continue I think that within ten years

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,990
we might see a world where if you did

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,089
something disruptive to a cloud system

00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:36,860
or to an AI system that it could be seen

00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:38,209
as warranting a very harsh penalty now

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,620
as we get to the end of the Industrial

00:16:38,209 --> 00:16:43,160
Revolution and more towards the modern

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,379
era we enter the often misunderstood

00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,899
Karl Marx this is the era that he's

00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:51,559
starting to ride in and during the time

00:16:49,899 --> 00:16:54,259
there were a lot of people who

00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:56,809
identified as Marxists or socialists or

00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:58,759
communists the most successful of them

00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:01,100
would have been in the United States

00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:05,240
trade unionists that's where that

00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,130
tradition really came out of and when

00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,870
people think unions they think often of

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,220
what a modern union looks like and I'll

00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,569
tell you modern unions generally don't

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,429
have to deal with bayonets like these

00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,110
folks are having to deal with you'll

00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:16,939
also notice that everyone on the right

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,529
half of the photo is black and the folks

00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:20,750
on the left half of the photo are mostly

00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:25,069
white so there's a very strong racial

00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:27,110
component here to really

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:28,730
unions were actually illegal for a lot

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:31,820
of their history you had to fight very

00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:33,500
hard to be recognized often against

00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,460
violence sometimes that violence even

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,940
came at the hands of the US military

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,740
but ultimately unions actually won so

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,600
they won the eight-hour workday they won

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,210
the five-day workweek they want a lot of

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,890
child labor laws so they still have some

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,210
positive connotations for a lot of

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,510
people today even if they're not as

00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,160
strong a force but they're also some

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,520
really negative connotations for unions

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:01,540
for some people so this is actually

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,760
historical advertisements it came from a

00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,790
union it's actually advertising

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,380
essentially anti a Asian racism because

00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:11,770
the unions were in favor of that at the

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,600
time so unions also were against women

00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:15,820
entering the workforce they were against

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,020
training new employees with the worry it

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:19,690
would drive down prices

00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,490
so where's unions have accomplished a

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:25,270
lot they also have some pretty bad

00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:29,350
history to them in some ways and was

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:30,910
that history that really led to unions

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:33,250
decreasing in membership so they had a

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:35,620
peak during the last century but

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,750
nowadays they're not nearly as strong or

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:41,260
as commonplace as they used to be for a

00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:43,780
variety of reasons and it was during

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,090
this time towards the beginning of the

00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,920
90s and onwards we start to see a new

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,700
trend something different really

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,900
coalescing power and that's software you

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,820
can actually argue that one of the

00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:56,770
reasons software was able to become so

00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,690
successful is because they were able to

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,790
avoid their employees ever unionizing

00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:02,410
from the start and that was actually a

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:05,380
very conscious move on their part

00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,270
this still is from an Amazon video they

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,980
actually hire anti-union training

00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:11,740
consultants to try and prevent unions

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,810
from ever forming so if your business

00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,760
consists of just algorithms and

00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:17,770
independent contractors with no rights

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,990
it's very easy to fire people quickly

00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:21,430
it's very easy to do disruptive changes

00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,050
so that's good for the people who own

00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:27,640
these companies and pretty bad for

00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:29,740
almost anyone else this one actually

00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:32,560
came out of way fair so I'm in Boston

00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,880
which is where Wayfair is the so called

00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,650
wayfarer walkout was people discovering

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,010
that wayfarer was contracting to sell

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,690
essentially children's beds to ice

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,370
detention facilities so basically

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:46,150
stopping furniture at concentration

00:19:45,370 --> 00:19:47,950
camps

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:49,510
a lot of wayfarer employees were very

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:52,150
unhappy when they found out about this

00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:55,090
so they started walking off the job and

00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,950
this is the CEO of wave hurt after those

00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,620
events deciding we only want to hire

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,030
non-political employees and there's a

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,620
lot of companies that are moving that

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,200
direction they don't want to see people

00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:07,930
involved in any union organizing in any

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,300
kind of political activism talking about

00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:11,620
climate change and it's not strictly

00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,720
because they just disagree with those

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,060
policies it's also because they want to

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,860
not ever have to give up control they

00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:22,150
want to have total control over what the

00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:23,500
business does but that's not inevitable

00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:25,480
and there's some really interesting

00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:30,580
stuff happening in 2020 that may change

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:33,250
some of that so Kickstarter got in the

00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,830
news last year because some employees

00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:38,830
had started to unionize and Kickstarter

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:40,450
actually retaliated against them fired

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,830
some of those organizers and this was

00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,540
despite Kickstarter having

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:45,700
reincorporated as a public benefit

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,190
corporation which is ideally meant to be

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,270
a little more publicly accountable and

00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,740
when they got called on it and news

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:54,640
articles they actually doubled down they

00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:57,490
started hiring a anti-union set of

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,140
lawyers to basically maintain a union

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,210
free workplace that sort of thing is

00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,650
actually pretty common in industry your

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:06,730
employer might actually be retaining the

00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:08,290
services of someone like that but they

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,730
still lost

00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:12,270
Kickstarter actually successfully

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,770
unionized they won their NLRB election

00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:17,050
so people have been calling them the

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:19,840
first like full-time white collar

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,700
essentially programmer or Union and

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,620
there's a lot of folks who are really

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,600
interested in that so they've been

00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,770
following that closely seeing is that

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,510
something that could be appropriate for

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:35,050
my workplace now for me I'm not actually

00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:36,640
a strictly Pro Union person right for me

00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:41,170
I actually tend to prefer cooperatives

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,720
this is my house and I live with a lot

00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:45,460
of people we own the house we actually

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,580
share all the decision-making together

00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:52,390
so seven humans four cats two snakes

00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:53,530
were all landlords here what does a

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:55,270
co-op actually mean right it means

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:57,060
cooperatively owned and cooperatively

00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:59,040
operated

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,110
basically you don't have a distinction

00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,500
between who the workers are and who the

00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:05,430
owners are and there's some people doing

00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,250
really interesting things with

00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:11,910
cooperatives in tech - there's actually

00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:14,310
a startup accelerator that essentially

00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:16,290
is a co-op itself and only starts other

00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:19,110
coops so trying to get more people

00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:21,390
owning parts of their company there's

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,410
also this idea of a platform cooperative

00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:24,390
and that actually takes it a step

00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:25,710
further it's not just the employees at

00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,450
the company who are part of the

00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:29,610
co-operative it's actually all the users

00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,320
- so you imagine something like a music

00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:33,960
streaming service where the engineers

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,940
building it the musicians who list their

00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,800
music and the listeners who are

00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,660
subscribing to that music could all be

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,580
involved in helping make decisions about

00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,560
the platform it's very different from

00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:45,480
the VC model where you actually want as

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:47,130
little control as possible you want to

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,500
try and extract value but you don't

00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:53,700
necessarily want to build a sustainable

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:55,590
organization so I'm not gonna tell you

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,960
that oh you should go join a union right

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,040
now or you should go form a co-op but

00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,360
way I'm gonna tell you there's a lot of

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,380
people are starting to do those things

00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,890
and starting to really take them

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,970
seriously as an economic alternative so

00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:07,680
if you're interested in the work that

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:09,660
any of these organizations are doing I'm

00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,850
gonna post a long Twitter thread about

00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:18,290
some cool resources in this area but

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:20,340
what I'd say is that all of this is

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,840
rooted in the past but it's still

00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,390
ongoing in the present there's still

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,130
ways to get involved and I think we're

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:27,780
really going to see some forms of labor

00:23:26,130 --> 00:23:29,010
organizing that aren't unions aren't

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,600
cooperatives aren't things we've ever

00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:31,830
even thought of before that are really

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,370
going to be tailored to the needs of

00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:37,500
tech so the next time you're on a job

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:38,610
and you see someone get fired you start

00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,170
wondering about what they're gonna do

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,430
for healthcare think about how different

00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,040
it might have been if they'd had a guild

00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:46,230
the next time someone protests an app

00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,180
think about whether you'd support that

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:51,510
if they decided to start smashing your

00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:55,080
data center the next time you see

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,670
someone get fired without cause think

00:23:55,080 --> 00:24:00,570
about what would happen if they had a

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:01,620
union to defend them most of all the

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,630
next time you're working on a project

00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:05,460
and you feel uncomfortable with what it

00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:08,310
says about society or what it says about

00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:09,750
your employer just reach out there's a

00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:09,990
lot of people are in that dilemma every

00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,900
day

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:14,220
and we can help you find a better job we

00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,850
can help you find one that aligns with

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,860
your values

00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:21,210
so ultimately people want to work with

00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,350
people who have strong moral values so

00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,870
I'm going to leave you with this quote

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:27,420
it's from the sci-fi and fantasy author

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:31,590
and also anarchist philosopher Ursula K

00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:34,860
Le Guin she gave this quote at a ward

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:37,410
ceremony that she was receiving and that

00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:39,059
award was actually one where she

00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:40,890
basically used the speech to protest

00:24:39,059 --> 00:24:43,110
against what all of her publishers had

00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:44,610
been doing partnering with Amazon so it

00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:48,210
doesn't say Amazon there but really this

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:50,309
is a quote about technology and she was

00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,450
standing up because for her the

00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:53,400
partnerships were pretty good she's a

00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,440
top selling author but for all the

00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,940
smaller authors people who aren't as

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,650
established it was a very bad deal with

00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:01,620
Amazon they were losing a lot of money

00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,300
on it and I hope that you'll read these

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,490
words and understand how they might

00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,650
apply to your workplace how that might

00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:09,630
help you start thinking about what's in

00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:11,190

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:14,820
relate to what other workers have done

00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:16,590
