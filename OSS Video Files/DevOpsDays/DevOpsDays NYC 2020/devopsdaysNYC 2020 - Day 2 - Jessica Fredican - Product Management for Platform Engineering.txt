Description: 
	Product Management for Platform Engineering: Why it matters and why it may be right for you

In this talk we’ll discuss the value that product management can bring to your platform engineering organization. Through founding platform enginering teams at Capital One and Flatiron Health I’ve learned how product management can help platform engineering and SRE teams achieve greater impact in their organization. I’ll show you how product management can help your platform teams identify the highest priority needs, get users’ feedback on your tools and influence teams to adopt your high value initiatives. We’ll also discuss when how and when to hire a product manager as well as how to incorporate some product management philosophies into your current practices.

awesome thanks everybody for for being

00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,490
here I'm Jess Predaking and really

00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,960
excited to be here and have the

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,940
opportunity to talk to the community

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
about product management for a platform

00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,090
engineering and I'm also very excited

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,350
now that I don't actually have to talk

00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,390
to you about platform engineering

00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,100
because talking about technical things

00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:36,910
in front of a room of engineers really

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:40,570
makes me nervous so first a little bit

00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,910
about me very early in my career I was

00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,500
an engineer for a couple of years and

00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,660
while I decided to move into product

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,920
management pretty quickly it left me

00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:50,350
with a passion for working with

00:00:47,920 --> 00:01:10,540
engineering teams and for advocating for

00:00:50,350 --> 00:01:10,840
the value of the work that they do all

00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,170
right

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,149
I've been an engineer but not but I am

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,460
still really passionate about working

00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:20,260
with engineering teams I've been in

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,869
product management since before there

00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:24,010
were schools to teach you how to do it

00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:27,240
and I worked on a lot of enterprise

00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:30,220
products like insurance marketplaces and

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,850
real estate marketplaces as well as an

00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:35,740
ad tech and customer servicing platforms

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,720
but most relevantly over the past couple

00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:39,909
years I've been managing teams of

00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,970
product managers who work with platform

00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:45,520
engineering teams and sre teams first at

00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,320
Capital One and now at Flatiron Health

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,900
which if you're not familiar with us

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,180
we're a health tech whose mission is to

00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:56,350
improve lives by learning from the

00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:59,920
experience of every cancer patient so I

00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,659
was inspired to give this talk after

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,210
coming across this pithy tweet on

00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,460
Twitter one day and my feed I had just

00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:08,470
moved to you Flatiron health to build

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,540
out a team of product managers for our

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,680
platform engineering teams and I was

00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,989
starting to see a lot of kind of growing

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,790
momentum in the industry and in the

00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:18,489
Twittersphere about product management

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:20,769
for a platform engineering because it's

00:02:18,489 --> 00:02:23,079
not traditionally a space where product

00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:25,780
managers have really been when I first

00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,850
started doing product for a platform

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,690
engineering teams at Capital One I got a

00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,670
lot of questions

00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,040
like why does that even need product

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:34,480
managers it's just engineering work it's

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,330
not like there's a product it's not like

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,680
you have like users or anything but it

00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:40,210
was pretty clear to me that there

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,890
actually is a lot of value that product

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,410
management can bring to platform

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,260
engineers it had form engineering teams

00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:49,000
the products they build the engineers

00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,180
that use those platforms and the

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,190
organization as a whole what really

00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:57,700
struck me about this tweet was the

00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:00,160
candor in expressing the challenges that

00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,990
platform engineers might face and making

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,180
that transition to being a product team

00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,460
and thinking about the work that they do

00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,040
not just as a series of technical tasks

00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,350
done behind the scenes but as a product

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,880
with customers and material business

00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:18,130
impact that happens during the day I

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,200
know a lot of career platform engineers

00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,750
haven't worked with product management

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,950
teams in the past so let's level up on

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:29,050
what product management actually is

00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,710
product managers don't do anything by

00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,710
which I mean

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,770
yeah you know that we we don't write

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,290
code right like we can't actually build

00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,530
anything most of us we don't create

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:44,720
designs we don't do marketing plans it's

00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:47,090
really about how we think about problems

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,980
and how we interact with people so

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,020
product managers take a customer-focused

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,240
approach to solving challenges for the

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,920
business because we believe what's good

00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,900
for user is good for business

00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:00,470
so if we can solve a challenge for the

00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:03,020
user that'll that'll solve a problem for

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,000
the business and we use that customer

00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,220
focus to set a strategic vision for

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,310
where we need to go and what we need to

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:11,239
build to get there so we think about

00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,769
setting the vision for how the product

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:14,840
is going to differentiate itself and

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:17,600
uniquely solve challenges for our users

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,400
and we do that by aligning closely with

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,010
our customers through talking to users

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,860
and getting direct feedback and doing

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,660
kind of broad market research and it's a

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,970
lot about getting alignment on that

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,680
vision and leading development teams and

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,080
stakeholders along the journey to get

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:35,350
there we set that strategic vision both

00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,850
internally and externally

00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,560
because different disciplines have

00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,570
different ideas about where we should be

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,850
going and what we need to do right like

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:46,190
design might feel that we need to

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,250
redesign a flow that's really kludgy for

00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,660
users and causing a lot of friction but

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,400
marketing might feel like we need to

00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:55,190
spend a lot more time thinking about our

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,990
in-house advertising so that our users

00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:59,240
know kind of a lot of the value that we

00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,830
can bring to them but products it's in

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,200
all the middle of that and is looking

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:04,850
out kind of horizontally for what's best

00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,880
for the product and what's best for the

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:11,060
user so not being too focused on any

00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,580
particular discipline but looking more

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:15,410
broadly at the user needs enables us to

00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,060
look at all these vectors and prioritize

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,669
the right thing to attack at the right

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:21,860
time we often use the metaphor that

00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,150
product is the hub of a wheel right

00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,710
we're the center of all of these

00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:26,870
different spokes like marketing and

00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:29,090
design and engineering account

00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:32,810
management and we keep everyone rolling

00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:36,020
along the same path but what is a

00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:38,120
product so a commonly used definition is

00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:39,500
that it's a combination of a customer

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,800
need where there's a business

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,450
opportunity to solve it with technology

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,160
the technology piece is probably pretty

00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:47,920
intuitive

00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,080
for platform engineering but while these

00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,780
platforms aren't being used by external

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,550
users you still have customers there the

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,100
engineering teams who leverage your

00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,500
platforms to build and ship and operate

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,440
their code I think it too often with

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:03,370
internally consumed platforms

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,990
organizations in neglect that there are

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:07,420
actually customers who are our

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,640
colleagues and they are really valuable

00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,400
customers because there is real business

00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,810
impact to the success of these platforms

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,510
the reliability of your organization's

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,040
features the success of deployments the

00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:20,500
speed and ease of feature development

00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,650
can be largely dependent on platform

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:25,000
engineering tooling we know reliability

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:27,190
is one of the most important features of

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,080
any system and it can have material

00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:32,020
impact on customer retention and

00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,780
engagement kludgy platforms and lack of

00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,280
observability can add up to wasted

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,960
engineering hours that could have been

00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,920
spent on delivering real value to

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,870
customers too often organizations treat

00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,090
these and other internal products as

00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,680
just a series of technical tasks but

00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:50,860
platform engineering products solve

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,990
customer challenges that are building

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,760
out and shipping and operating those

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:59,050
customer facing features for your

00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,760
business product management and

00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,890
engineering bring different strengths to

00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,000
the table and we bring them together to

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:06,370
build the best product

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,760
possible products so this is often

00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:12,430
expressed as the why versus the how

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,169
product asks what we need to build who

00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,000
we are building it for and when's the

00:07:14,169 --> 00:07:18,220
right time to build it products

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,020
accountabilities are around what are the

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,850
customer challenges we're facing what

00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:24,669
are the business opportunities that can

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,960
be solved for basically the strategy for

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:29,290
how we'll meet a business opportunity

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:31,300
and in this relationship engineering is

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,610
the Masters of how we meet those needs

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,680
what technologies apply we apply to

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:38,140
implement our strategy and how long it's

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,850
gonna take product should never really

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,610
be telling you how long you need to

00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:44,620
build something the confluence of these

00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,080
two disciplines is what actually gets

00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,390
built in product development and so

00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,220
we're most successful through a deep

00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:53,500
collaboration between product and

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,720
engineering in a unified product

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,670
development team we each bring our own

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,250
areas of expertise

00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:02,560
but that area of overlap is our shared

00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:03,910
output and in an ideal state your

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,550
product manager is sharing enough

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,960
business and user context with you so

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,820
that you can leverage your technical

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,150
expertise to figure out the best way to

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,920
solve for that high-priority need so as

00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:17,110
an example your product manager might

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,450
say to you we're hearing a lot from our

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:20,950
users that mobile deployments are really

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:23,530
annoying and they keep failing and

00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:24,900
they're kind of hard to make work but

00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,310
there's a big business push right now to

00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,800
deploy a lot of new features to our

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,690
mobile channel so stability of our

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,750
mobile deployment pipeline is really

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,090
important right now we need to get to a

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,640
95% success rate for those deployments

00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:41,890
so then engineering has the opportunity

00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,720
to think through some ways that we might

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:48,130
be able to achieve that and estimate how

00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:50,200
long that's going to take us we add a

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,630
lot of value to platform engineering in

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,600
a lot of ways I think the first big way

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,180
is in gathering requirements figuring

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,220
out what all the different teams are our

00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,320
users and the different products needs

00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:04,030
from your platforms and make sure you

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,940
have all of the critical use cases

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:08,500
covered whether they might be languages

00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,750
you need to support or deployment

00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:12,730
patterns if you've ever deployed

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,410
something to your organization and then

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,060
eventually heard rumblings that it

00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,010
wasn't really working for people and

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,710
they didn't want to use it you know how

00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,290
important this is product can help by

00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:25,510
conducting user interviews and

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:27,400
identifying needs with your actual users

00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:31,300
before you actually write any code at

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:33,460
all and once your platforms are out in

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,710
the world and being consumed product can

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,570
help aggregate and synthesize feedback

00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:39,730
about what's working and what could be

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,620
improved where the next opportunities

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,300
might be and they can help you get

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,970
feedback early and often in the

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,500
development stages so you can get

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,540
feedback on work while still in a

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,700
prototype or maybe in a limited beta

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:54,010
while it's still relatively easy to make

00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:57,390
adjustments and ultimately enable you to

00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,070
ship more value faster to your customers

00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,990
and we use all those requirements and

00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:03,340
feedback to make sure that what you're

00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,200
building lines up with the right

00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,570
corporate goals and solves the problems

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,130
the business most cares about a good

00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,690
product manager is going to be tapped

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:13,240
into corporate strategies

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,250
priorities we keep our heads up on that

00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,010
horizontal view and don't actually do

00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,480
anything so that we can kind of keep our

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,670
heads up on what's happening in the

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,820
market and in the organization so that

00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,810
we can prioritize the right stuff for

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,180
instance if an organization is really

00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:29,680
focused on reducing up X your product

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,600
manager might want to focus priority is

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,760
on how your tooling can help contribute

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,590
to that other times there might be kind

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,150
of larger goals around speeding time to

00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,400
delivery for features and that'll inform

00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:42,910
kind of what the priorities are that you

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,460
work on product can also be really

00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:50,040
instrumental in making sure that the

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:52,930
value of your work your team is doing

00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,790
we're go is broadcast across the

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,810
organization so it's really heard and

00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,600
understood by everyone

00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:00,520
we're the the voice of the product an

00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,590
evangelist for its value not only with

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,870
other engineering teams that consume

00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:06,970
your products but also the products who

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,040
need to understand the value of what

00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,650
your team is doing and understand why

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,300
they should prioritize upgrades or other

00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:18,130
things you might be asking their team to

00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:21,250
take on we're also really instrumental

00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:23,050
in broadcasting value to leadership and

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,030
other business stakeholders who might

00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,400
not be super technical but care that

00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:29,680
your platforms impact team's delivery

00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:34,510
ability to deliver faster or more

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,890
reliable reliably the customers so what

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:39,700
can you expect with working with a

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:42,010
product manager there probably won't be

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,170
as technical as you and that is okay

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:45,700
we're just technical enough to hold a

00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,130
conversation and know how to prioritize

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,320
work we're bringing a different skill

00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,900
set about frameworks for prioritization

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:57,339
and nuances for communicating with

00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:59,470
non-technical stakeholders one of the

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:01,660
ways that we communicate at a macro

00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,300
level is through a product roadmap it's

00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,339
a high-level directional view of what we

00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,580
want to learn and accomplish typically

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:11,170
over an 8 to 12 month timeline it's not

00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:13,180
a strict project plan that you're being

00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,370
committed to you but again it's kind of

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,130
a directional view to express product

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,570
strategy both internally to the team and

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:23,590
externally to stay

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,900
holder's another way that we communicate

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:28,270
at a more micro level is through user

00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:31,000
stories maybe maybe we're using these

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:33,670
already with your team but they're a way

00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,380
the product expresses an alliance with

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:38,440
our engineering teams about future

00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:40,930
requirements so a story will outline who

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,910
the primary user is what that user is

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,100
trying to accomplish and why they want

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:47,890
to accomplish that

00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,440
so here the the who is a newly hired

00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:52,390
essary they want to be added to page or

00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,040
duty automatically because they want to

00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:56,020
dive right in and help their team

00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:58,390
respond to incidents without having to

00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,600
remember to do this manually and figure

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,790
out how to do it the the Y is really the

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,220
most important part of the user story

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,620
it's that context on the business and

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,810
the user need so that engineers can make

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:14,470
good decisions about how to tactically

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,940
solve for this in a sustainable way and

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,410
you'll notice that this is super

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,870
high-level right and there's not a lot

00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:21,850
of hardware requirements the idea is

00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,000
that we're taking a user focus view of

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:26,740
what we need our systems to do and it

00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,480
opens up a conversation that we can

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:31,000
figure out as a team together exactly

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,620
how to execute on this so this will

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,290
eventually get filled out with some more

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,120
acceptance criteria about exactly what

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:38,890
Don is gonna look like but this is

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,270
really kind of the starting place of the

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,770
conversation between product and

00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:45,790
engineering to make sure that we're

00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:48,220
meeting user needs product managers

00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:50,260
asked a lot of questions and we can

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:52,870
sometimes be annoying and the number of

00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:55,000
questions we ask you might be familiar

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,680
with the five why's from post mortems

00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,900
that's something that's very dear to us

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,520
because we're trying to get to the heart

00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,350
of a problem and make sure that we're

00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,580
solving the right problem because if

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,990
we're gonna ask you to spend time

00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:07,290
working on something we want to make

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,940
sure that it's actually the right thing

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:12,100
it's also one of the best ways for us to

00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,140
learn because we're usually the least

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,600
technical person in the room and while

00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:18,040
we may be more technical than a lot of

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,900
other product managers of building

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,260
consumer facing features there's always

00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,730
stuff for us to ramp up on right

00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,980
engineering is not our full-time job so

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,660
having conversations with product

00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
manager

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,750
for us having conversations with

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,640
engineering is one of the best ways for

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,310
us to learn and it's also a really great

00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,410
way for us to build rapport so we can

00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:41,180
have more effective conversations about

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:41,180
what it is we're trying to accomplish

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,270
one of the most important things

00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:47,250
coach my product managers on is that

00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:49,710
they are the poop emoji umbrellas for

00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:51,990
their engineering teams they are the

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:54,660
front line for feedback for complaints

00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,670
first wheels corporate and decision

00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:59,520
meetings that could have been an email

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,230
so that engineering teams can focus on

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,320
the hard work of delivering great

00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:06,090
technology to the business when we

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,760
decide as a team what the priorities are

00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:11,130
we make sure that we that they don't get

00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,610
changed unnecessarily or we're not just

00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,260
prioritizing a hippo's pet project that

00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:17,090
doesn't maybe add a lot of general value

00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:20,550
to the business

00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,140
so asking those annoying questions helps

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,910
us make sure that we can manage that

00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:28,020
poop emoji a little bit better on your

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:29,550
behalf I expect that products gonna come

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,440
in and want to take a leadership role in

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:34,050
helping shape the work that gets done

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,610
and when it happens they need to have

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:37,290
ownership and accountability to that

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:39,120
because they're gonna be accountable

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,250
back to the business to make sure that

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,410
what your team is working on is lining

00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,750
up to business goals thinking back to

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,790
that Venn diagram of product owns the Y

00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:49,560
in the strategy they're gonna own

00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:51,720
prioritization because they're

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,550
accountable to what it means that that

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,100
work is done and that user needs have

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:58,350
been met so make sure that you include

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,480
them in emails and decisions and

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:01,890
requests for your time it's super

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,720
important so that they have kind of all

00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:07,290
the contexts that they need to make good

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:08,790
prioritization trade-offs which is not

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,260
to say that product managers were gonna

00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,020
come in and take over everything

00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,570
it's a partnership product managers are

00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,190
not dictators so we sometimes use this

00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:19,920
metaphor and product management that

00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:21,780
product managers are the mini CEO but a

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,550
good CEO is not a dictator right they

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,990
offer strategic guidance and they

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:29,790
advocate for the product so bringing

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,580
expertise on how to style solve the

00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:34,140
challenges that products raising

00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:36,450
ideation and prioritization is a two-way

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:37,529
street right it's not all just product

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,269
filtering down stuff

00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,009
comes from the business here this

00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:42,959
critical role of raising up your

00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:46,050
technical expertise for what your

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,699
products might benefit from so

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,069
collaborate on building out that roadmap

00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:52,680
about what needs to get built when and

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:54,360
share that information both ways while

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,490
they're gonna share context with you on

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,350
what's happening in the business and

00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,970
other product teams at large share

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,920
contacts on kind of what's happening in

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,540
the tech world and technology decisions

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,120
that are being made elsewhere in the

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,799
organization one of the most

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,589
collaborative relationships I had with

00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:12,059
my engineering teams was I was an I say

00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,130
product manager at this healthcare

00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:15,600
startup and we were building doctor

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,789
binders for health insurance companies

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,650
and I was talking to my engineering

00:17:17,789 --> 00:17:21,360
teams a lot about our struggles with our

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,159
search and we're getting a lot of

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,650
complaints from clients that like search

00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:28,770
didn't work and we were seeing a lot of

00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:31,080
failed searches in our analytics when we

00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:32,970
started to dive into that we were

00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,120
starting to see that like our customers

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,429
were searching for things like ent and I

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:40,289
doctor and those were a lot of the

00:17:38,429 --> 00:17:42,510
things that we're feeling and then it

00:17:40,289 --> 00:17:43,830
kind of made me realize that well this

00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:46,289
was happening because we were beholden

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:48,330
to our health insurances taxonomies for

00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:51,179
what specialties were so our health

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:53,730
insurance tax on amis had specialties

00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,470
like otolaryngologist which if you don't

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:58,380
know isn't ante

00:17:55,470 --> 00:18:02,220
and an optometrist but like no human is

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,679
searching for otolaryngologist and then

00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,970
as we were considering whether or not we

00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,070
should be upgrading to the newest

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:09,330
version of solar at the time my

00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,039
engineering lead mentioned to me that

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:14,460
this new version supported synonym

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:16,950
search and that we could use EMT and

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,679
optometrist as synonyms and then map

00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,169
that back to our health insurance

00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:23,610
companies taxonomy and enable users to

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,409
actually search for things the way that

00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:29,090
they use like the way that they speak

00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:31,530
which was a huge win for our customers

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:34,950
it sounds great but do you really need

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:36,419
one it depends I have to say it's really

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,100
satisfying to get to save that to

00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:41,549
engineers for once

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:46,329
[Laughter]

00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:48,399
so if you have centralized teams

00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:50,169
building out platform engineering tools

00:18:48,399 --> 00:18:51,969
for your organization as a whole

00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:54,429
you could really benefit from a product

00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:57,219
manager because in this model you have

00:18:54,429 --> 00:19:00,879
that crucial component of Technology and

00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:02,849
business impact and customers if you're

00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:05,379
small and teams are managing their ops

00:19:02,849 --> 00:19:06,669
and you own that on them yourselves

00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:08,529
you probably don't need a product

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:10,509
manager specifically for platform

00:19:08,529 --> 00:19:11,919
engineering teams are solving their own

00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:13,569
challenges for themselves and they're

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,479
kind of missing that crucial component

00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:18,459
of having a customer but even if you're

00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:20,559
just building operational work as part

00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:22,089
of future delivery teams get your

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,399
product manager involved in that work

00:19:22,089 --> 00:19:27,009
because you can help inform decisions

00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:29,619
about when's a good time to make those

00:19:27,009 --> 00:19:31,779
operational investments and when is a

00:19:29,619 --> 00:19:33,369
good time to kind of acquire a little

00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,459
bit more debt so you can ship to new

00:19:33,369 --> 00:19:38,440
features I definitely have done this

00:19:36,459 --> 00:19:41,769
wrong in the past as a product manager

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,169
in that that same startup I had

00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:46,629
definitely had my team in Death March

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,889
two features we were kind of you know in

00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:49,149
that difficult startup mode where you're

00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:51,669
like trying to ship stuff really fast

00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:54,069
and sales keep selling stuff that

00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:56,889
doesn't exist and kind of pushing and

00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:58,239
pushing out new features and teams were

00:19:56,889 --> 00:20:00,399
getting kind of crumbly about it and

00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:01,959
then one day I walk into planning and my

00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:03,639
engineers were like Fredrik and we are

00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:05,829
not working on your backlog this friend

00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:08,739
which was super telling that they were

00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:10,569
like this is your backlog they said we

00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:12,759
are gonna add some monitoring to this

00:20:10,569 --> 00:20:15,009
platform and that is that and like we

00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:17,440
will see you next spring I'm sure like

00:20:15,009 --> 00:20:20,679
ultimately it was a good call on their

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,809
part but we could have you know done

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,609
that a little bit more healthily and

00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:27,429
maybe not gotten to that point where

00:20:24,609 --> 00:20:30,190
they just like completely committed me

00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,449
so having conversations both ways can

00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,769
really make sure that you don't get to

00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:37,059
that point where you're like ready to

00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:38,859
blow up your relationship so once you

00:20:37,059 --> 00:20:40,209
decide to need a product manager you

00:20:38,859 --> 00:20:42,249
might run into some challenges that

00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:43,239
leadership doesn't really into it that

00:20:42,249 --> 00:20:45,039
you were building mission-critical

00:20:43,239 --> 00:20:47,679
products and not just a series of

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,569
technical tasks so you might get some of

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,129
those similar questions about why you

00:20:49,569 --> 00:20:51,740
need a product manager if there's not a

00:20:51,129 --> 00:20:54,770
custom

00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:56,900
so you need to paint a picture for how

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,370
important this is to your business and

00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,560
to do that you want to pull some data

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:02,690
about how your platforms roll up to your

00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,160
corporate mission talk about what you

00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:06,230
think you can achieve by having a

00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,610
product manager and how that can help

00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:09,530
keep you better connected to the mission

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,900
and make sure that the work that you're

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:14,360
releasing it aligns up with goals a

00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:16,310
little better and you might want to give

00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,280
an example of maybe how that hasn't gone

00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:21,170
well in the past and point out that you

00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:23,420
have a lot of customers because other

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,460
engineers are your customers and your

00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:29,900
work impacts their ability to deliver

00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:31,460
work to external customers so once you

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,170
have leadership onboard a couple of

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,840
things to keep in mind when hiring your

00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:37,370
first product manager there's a

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,470
temptation to have them roll up into

00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:41,030
engineering but your product mentor

00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,130
who's gonna be more successful if they

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,350
report into a broader product team if

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:47,420
you've got one it's gonna help them stay

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,800
connected to business priorities it kind

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:51,380
of what's happening throughout the rest

00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,610
of the organization so you'll want to

00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,370
figure out who's the right person for

00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,770
them to roll up to but you also want

00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:59,690
someone who's a little bit senior not so

00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,760
senior that they can't step in and do a

00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:03,590
little bit of work but senior enough

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,240
that they can handle walking into a role

00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:07,670
that's not gonna be super defined for

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,920
them so pretty technically that probably

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:12,080
translates to someone like four or six

00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,290
years of experience working as a product

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,910
manager and when you're evaluating

00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:19,190
people you want them again to be

00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:20,510
technical but not SuperDuper technical

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,370
right you don't need them to know how to

00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:24,110
write code but they need to be able to

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:27,440
have a conversation with you about tech

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:31,250
ecosystems you might want you might want

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,020
to do like a high-level or architectural

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,510
diagram or kind of like a technical flow

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,890
to make sure that they're aware of major

00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:39,590
elements and kind of how they work

00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,510
together I'll say that as product

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,270
managers we often feel like we need to

00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:46,010
write code to be technical but I think

00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:47,960
you probably have some experience that

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:50,270
just like doing a MOOC once on Python

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:53,060
doesn't necessarily make you technical I

00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,620
found that that can be helpful indicator

00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:56,420
that they're gonna write really good

00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:58,010
user stories and write them out in a way

00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,600
that's kind of really logical about how

00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,970
you might think about executing on them

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,399
but isn't necessarily a great tell but

00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:06,539
they're gonna have the kind of

00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:09,369
technical expertise that you need I

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:09,879
really loved this quote from a paper

00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:12,429
called

00:23:09,879 --> 00:23:15,039
SOE tools as products I was written last

00:23:12,429 --> 00:23:17,710
year by Jonesy Smith who's an SRE at

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,379
Google I love her reflection on how

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:22,830
changing about thinking about SOA work

00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:24,999
from a series of technical tasks to

00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:26,679
thinking of it as platform engineering

00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:29,649
tools or sorry platform engineering

00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:32,169
products has had a big impact on the SOE

00:23:29,649 --> 00:23:33,759
teams working in this model and the

00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:36,609
teams that use the platform's they

00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:38,200
support because fundamentally whether or

00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:40,299
not platform engineering tools are in a

00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,399
position to sustain their own product

00:23:40,299 --> 00:23:45,580
manager or not implementing some of

00:23:42,399 --> 00:23:47,799
those same principles about customer

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,450
focus and strong vision on how to serve

00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:51,519
customer needs more broadly than a

00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,440
series of technical tasks will enable

00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,999
platform engineering teams to have a

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,789
greater impact on their engineering

00:23:54,999 --> 00:24:01,770
users their external customers and the

00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:05,090
business as a whole thank you

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:12,119
