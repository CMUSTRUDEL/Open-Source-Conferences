Description: 
	Product Management for Platform Engineering: Why it matters and why it may be right for you

In this talk we’ll discuss the value that product management can bring to your platform engineering organization. Through founding platform enginering teams at Capital One and Flatiron Health I’ve learned how product management can help platform engineering and SRE teams achieve greater impact in their organization. I’ll show you how product management can help your platform teams identify the highest priority needs, get users’ feedback on your tools and influence teams to adopt your high value initiatives. We’ll also discuss when how and when to hire a product manager as well as how to incorporate some product management philosophies into your current practices.
