Description: 
	Building Meaningful Network Connections by Michael Miles

Networking with other professionals is an important part of everyoneâ€™s career as it allow for creating mutually beneficial and meaningful professional connections. But, it can be overwhelming to attend a conference, prospective client meeting or a public event and try to connect with others. The ability to network successfully seems to be a dark art that a handful of people know or an inherent skill that only certain types of people possess.

Like anything else, networking with other professionals is a skill anyone can learn. It is an act that can be broken down into a series of repeatable steps that can be learned and followed by anyone and everyone. This presentation breaks down the act of professional networking into a series of simple steps and practices. Using the speakers personal experiences as case studies, attendees will learn how to follow these steps and practices to build and grow their own professional networks.

	00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,560
All right.

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,150
Thank you, everyone.

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm happy to be here.

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,160
Excited to be here.

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,690
I've never been to DevOps before.

00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,670
But I walk by this building every day on my way to work.

00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,310
Excited to be in the building too.

00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,310
Really cool.

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,050
So, yeah, a little bit about myself.

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:33,690
My name is Mike Miles, VP of development for a digital marketing company, Genuine.

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:40,460
We do everything from implementation and strategy, UX design and development of online applications

00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,190
for our clients.

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,090
In the development department, we use a lot of DevOps tools to automate our build processes.

00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,719
It's a lot of fun.

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,800
At night I host a podcast called Developing Up which is focused on the non technical side

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,890
of being a developer and engineer.

00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,100
Everything you need to know about having a career in this field that doesn't have to

00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,309
do with the technology.

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,560
It's the soft skills around it such as networking.

00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:07,760
You can find me anywhere online, micmiles86, Twitter, LinkedIn.

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,490
I'm not on Facebook.

00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,330
Sorry, Facebook.

00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,159
Nasty, networking.

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,450
So, the big scary word in my experience for engineers.

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,100
I'm not talking about networking with systems or computers, I'm talking about networking

00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,980
with other people.

00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:28,610
I think everybody here is a step ahead of that.

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:32,250
We're at a conference, been talking during lunch and during the break.

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,570
But networking is very important for your career and your job.

00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:37,140
Why is it important?

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,110
It's all about on the your left on the left here, opportunities.

00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:47,440
You're to the gonna find opportunities in your role, in your career, in your life, without

00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,290
being able to talk to other people and building these connections with other people that you

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:54,870
can have menu have be mutually beneficial.

00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,040
It's going help in your career.

00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,979
Here at a conference, you're meeting a lot of people.

00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:04,360
Maybe learn about a new technology or a new framework that you haven't use order haven't

00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,040
thought about using, but you have a conversation with somebody and bring it back to your team

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,899
and improve your processes.

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:12,840
It's going improve your life because you're going to build up skill dos talk to other

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:19,070
people, make connections and use them to find opportunities, personal opportunities, new

00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,060
job opportunities and whatnot.

00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,569
Why is it important?

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:26,760
Being able to talk to people and make an impact is an important skill.

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,180
Doesn't matter what career you have, it's just an important skill.

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,099
It's one that I personally think is very hard to do.

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,840
I'm sure some people have agreed with me.

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,351
But it's something that if you learn how to do it and do it well, you're going to find

00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,351
a lot of benefits.

00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:46,879
So, what we're going to talk about it because this is DevOpsDays, we like to break things

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,209
into automated process that we can repeat.

00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:58,220
I'm going break down the act of networking with other people into eight repeatable steps.

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,750
Like from the keynote this morning, you don't have to spend the money coins, those mined

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,310
coins, every time up of you want to make a new connection.

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,170
And I will use case studies from my personal life and how it's benefited my career to help

00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:13,090
show you the benefits.

00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:21,260
So, networking, three simple phases, the preparation phase, the engagement phase where you do out

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:27,680
work and the connection phase where you keep it alive if you want to do that.

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,049
The engagement takes the most amount of effort for yourself.

00:03:33,049 --> 00:03:35,370
But it produces great results.

00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:40,360
Number one, the step one, have a plan of attack.

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,090
Know what you're going to do any time you want to get interest into a potential networking

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,090
opportunity.

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,910
A networking opportunity could be many things, waiting in a coffee line at a conference.

00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,000
Turn around and talk to somebody.

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,830
Stuck at the airport because of delay.

00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:59,549
It could be meeting with a new client or new stakeholders at your job.

00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:01,189
Those are all networking opportunities.

00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:04,349
You want to go in each one of those, having a plan of what you want to accomplish.

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:09,030
I think if you don't have a plan, it's easy to get overwhelmed and kind of just step back

00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,310
and to not engage.

00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,450
So, I say set a goal.

00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,650
Pick the one thing you want to accomplish at a networking event and only focus on that

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,000
one thing.

00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,040
Be that meet one new person, learn their name, learn what they do.

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,890
It could be, you know, meet ten people.

00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:29,870
It could be share a personal anecdote of something positive you've learned in the last 24 hours.

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,669
Set a goal that's simple and achievable and focus on that so you don't get overwhelmed

00:04:33,669 --> 00:04:35,259
in any networking situation.

00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:41,150
So, our first case study, I don't expect anyone to recognize this man dancing in this GIF.

00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,850
That is the old President of my company, Genuine, Grayson.

00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:50,430
He married my wife and I.

00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,430
How long ago?

00:04:51,430 --> 00:05:00,590
Eleven years ago I was asked at my college, Wentworth, here in Boston, was asked to revamp

00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,570
the computer science department and the curriculum.

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,800
I went there for the evening and talked with my professors and told her I didn't like the

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,920
job I was at currently.

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,720
I told her how it was not fulfilling, I wasn't getting a lot.

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,270
I didn't like the people I was working for.

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:20,410
She said there will be someone who is owning a company that has digital developers.

00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,940
You will talk to him and make a connection.

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,870
She gave me that for the evening.

00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,120
It was John Grayson.

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,430
I sat down and participated what I was supposed to do.

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:38,070
I talked to John, learned about his Company, what they do, and shared stuff about myself.

00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,800
And we talked the whole night.

00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,419
He gave me his business card, asked for my resume.

00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:44,710
Two days later I was in for an interview.

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:47,530
By the end of the week, a job offer.

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,270
I have been there 10 years now.

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:56,070
Hi not focused on that goal from the professor, I wouldn't have engaged in this conversation.

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,759
My career wouldn't be as fulfilling as it is today.

00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,940
Step one.

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,320
Step two, method acting.

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,520
Figure out who you're going to be for the situation.

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,950
To do this, I say adopt a persona.

00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:17,910
It can be easy for humans to think negatively of ourselves.

00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,949
Be like, you want me to go talks to a stranger?

00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,550
That's not the type of person I am.

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,699
I'm not good at doing that, I can't make small talk.

00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,440
Envision the best version of yourself for the situation and try to be that person.

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,199
Or at least pretend and imagine what that person would do.

00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,650
It doesn't have to be yourself.

00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,030
Think of the person in your social circles.

00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:45,460
Randy is just really great, he walks up and talks to them.

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,090
Case study, every time I present.

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:52,720
The person before you right now, this is presenter Mike Miles, this is not every day Mike Miles.

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,580
Even in the last session, sitting in the middle, hands shaking opinion but as soon as I'm on

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,130
stage, I adopt a version of myself.

00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:10,480
I have built this persona by watching other great presenters and adapt and learn what

00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,480
they've done.

00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,810
And over the years, as you do it, that version of yourself, comes second nature.

00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:22,460
As soon as I stepped on stage, that took over and you see presenter Mike Miles.

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:27,130
As soon as I get off here, I'll black out and won't remember what I said.

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,130
It's weird.

00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,300
But it works.

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
All right.

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,300
Step three.

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,520
The 3 second rule.

00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,830
This is probably the most important step to start the engagement of a networking situation.

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,050
You have to outrun your anxiety.

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,360
Any anxiety you may have.

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,460
Now, the 3 second rule comes from Neil Strauss who wrote the book the game about dating.

00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:55,069
I heard this interview on the smart passive income podcast with Pat Flynn.

00:07:55,069 --> 00:07:59,800
Never give yourself more than 3 seconds to psych yourself out if you want to meet someone

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,970
new.

00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:06,020
You are going to doubt yourself and not engage to make a connection.

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,360
But give yourself 3 seconds and go for it, you can't psych yourself out.

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,360
Be fearless.

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,410
What's the worst that could happen by introducing yourself?

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,770
The worst is the person is not going to want to engage and then you move on to another

00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,470
situation.

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,849
That's easier said than done, I understand that.

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,500
Another case study.

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,280
The first time I met Dries Buytaert.

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,199
Anybody know him?

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,830
He's the creator of the PHP framework Drupal.

00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,410
Something I use every day.

00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,610
I'm a developer, I guess I use PHP.

00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,840
And I'm not afraid to admit it.

00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,419
All right.

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:43,419
Good.

00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:44,419
They're based here in Boston.

00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:47,810
I've used Drupal for over a decade now.

00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,810
He's the guy who created it.

00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,930
You see him at the conferences, kind of the rock star in the room when he's there.

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,769
I was at this yearly conference for Drupal a couple years ago and I saw Dries at the

00:08:58,769 --> 00:08:59,769
party.

00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:04,580
And I really wanted to talk to him and about the framework and the open source community

00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,310
and everything behind it.

00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,360
I didn't know about the 3 second rule at the time.

00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:13,649
So, I spent the whole party moving around Dries, slowly circling him.

00:09:13,649 --> 00:09:16,890
And I just couldn't engage with him.

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,540
So, this is not this is not a step to do.

00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:23,899
But I got some liquid courage because there were free whiskey drinks yes.

00:09:23,899 --> 00:09:25,430
And so, finally, I was like, all right.

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,430
I'm gonna do it.

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,430
Dries is standing there.

00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:32,120
One, two, three, I stepped in front of him, I mumbled something about how great Drupal

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,310
was and it was great to meet him.

00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,209
And he nodded and I left.

00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:38,530
And I blacked out after that too.

00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:45,450
But anyways, I had to figure out and get past that anxiety I had to meet with him.

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,600
He's just another person.

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,941
So, I counted to three in my head and I did it.

00:09:49,941 --> 00:09:51,010
So, I say do that for yourself.

00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,089
When you're about to engage with someone, you figured out your target, person you want

00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:59,180
to talk with, go over there, one, two, three, and just start walking.

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,490
Start doing it.

00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,260
Take action.

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,990
Step four, say cheese.

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:06,020
This is all about what's going on with your face.

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,870
So, what would you rather talk to, the person on your left or the person on your right?

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,071
If you want to make an engagement and network with someone, a positive experience, you have

00:10:18,071 --> 00:10:19,170
to bring a positivity.

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,740
So, keep positive, smile, be open, be friendly.

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,490
I'm not saying put on a joker smile.

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,450
But think about every time you're engaged, it's going to be an opportunity for yourself.

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,529
Think positively about that.

00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:35,990
So, get a smile on as you're walking over, extending your hand, you're going to say hello.

00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,990
Be friendly.

00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,579
If not, what's going on?

00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:42,390
Not even looking at the person, it's not starting off well.

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:46,890
You're not going to start building a connection with that person.

00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:49,220
Step five, the magic word.

00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,790
The word that everyone loves to hear.

00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:56,740
I get this from this rule from another thing that I've read.

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,040
From Dale Carnegie who wrote how to win friends and influence people.

00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,170
A book that's been in fingerprint for like 90 years.

00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,260
If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it.

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,390
He says remember that a person's name to that person is the sweetest and most important

00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,750
sound in any language.

00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,750
Think about it.

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,660
No matter the size of the room you're in, if you hear someone mention your name, even

00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,530
across the room, your ears pick it up.

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:20,980
You pick up your name opinion everyone loves to hear their name.

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:25,170
As you start to talk to someone, start to begin to have a conversation, learn their

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,410
name and use their name.

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,200
You're not going to be like, hey, David, nice to meet you, David, what brings you to DevOpsDays,

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,200
David?

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,360
I don't know if there's a David here, but nice to meet you.

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,000
You want to repeat it out loud and in your head.

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,269
I repeat people's name's in my heads all the time.

00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,269
The Lira formula.

00:11:48,269 --> 00:11:49,269
Look and listen.

00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,650
Start to engage with someone, hey, nice to meet you, what's your name?

00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:56,889
You're going to pay attention to them, if you don't to want look in the eyes, at the

00:11:56,889 --> 00:11:59,060
forehead, bridge of the nose or their chin.

00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:06,089
They can't tell you're not looking directly into the eyes.

00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:07,089
Just listen.

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,720
Listen for their name and pay 100% attention to them.

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,230
Then you want to create an impression of this person.

00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:16,399
So, as you're talking to them, nice to meet you, Susan.

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:17,500
All right.

00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Susan.

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,129
Brown hair nice to meet you, Susan.

00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:27,529
[ Laughter ] So, start building a mental picture of that

00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:28,930
person in your head.

00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,280
Make note of anything that will help you remember them.

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,050
You know how you think, you know what you pay attention to.

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,050
Repeat the person's name.

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,050
I already covered this.

00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,790
Repeat it internally and externally.

00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,790
Nice to meet you, Susan.

00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,649
What brings you to DevOpsDays?

00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:41,649
Great.

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:42,840
How did you get to this role?

00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,730
What do you do for work?

00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,440
Use their name, they're going to stay engaged in the conversation.

00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,530
They're going to perk up and you're going to reinforce that you know what their name

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,530
is.

00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,490
And make an association tots situation.

00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:56,320
It's easy here at a conference.

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,860
I met Susan at DevOpsDays.

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,970
Her role is an SRE.

00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:05,970
But make an association to the situation so that your brain recognizes that, the next

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:11,170
time you hear their name or connect with them later on, you can recognize where it was and

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,780
the context you had the conversation in.

00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
Learn the names.

00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,079
It's the only way to make someone not a stranger.

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,829
And if they're not a stranger, they're a friend.

00:13:17,829 --> 00:13:22,540
And you can have a better conversation with them and start building a meaningful connection.

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:25,770
We're going to get into connecting with people.

00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,149
All of this was just to get introduced to somebody.

00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,480
These first steps.

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,380
So, engagement.

00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,240
Riddle me this.

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,990
The easiest way to start a conversation is to ask questions.

00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,220
You don't have to be the master of a topic.

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,560
You don't have to be the master of small talk.

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,810
You just have to know how to ask questions.

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:49,570
Asking questions are in this situation finding the common connection that lets people talk

00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:50,700
about themselves.

00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,490
People love hearing their names and talking about themselves.

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,610
You want to find a way to do that.

00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:00,649
The phrase goes, ask simple questions to get complex answers.

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:07,290
Now, in a situation like a conference, like today, everyone has something in common, right?

00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,449
We all have something related to DevOps.

00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:11,150
We all are here for a reason.

00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,889
That has a simple question that you saw, what bring use to DevOpsDays?

00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,800
You could be trapped in the airport.

00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,640
Where were you trying to go on your flight?

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,500
It starts building up something that you have in common so that you can start pulling on

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
a thread from there.

00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,930
Think of it, this phrase of asking questions, this phase is like throwing a beach ball in

00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:30,930
the air.

00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:33,149
You're trying to throw it to the person so that they throw it back.

00:14:33,149 --> 00:14:39,089
And they throw at many beach balls as you need to find something to connect with.

00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,810
And a case study is strangers in an Iceland.

00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,490
I was to speak at a conference in Iceland.

00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,630
Iceland.

00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,990
It was great.

00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,730
People were there from 30 difference countries.

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:59,110
There were a lot of opportunities to talk to people from different backgrounds and perspectives.

00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:05,490
It made lunchtime very nerve wracking, at least for myself, because I didn't know nobody.

00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:11,210
I sat down with a group of people and started asking people's names and said, have you ever

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,720
been to Iceland before?

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,760
Why did you come?

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,370
What brings us to the conference today?

00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,370
What's your role?

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,210
And we started having the conversations from simple things I had in common.

00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,200
I started learning about their backgrounds.

00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,290
Some had similarities in the technology I was using.

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,300
What they're interested in, we built a connection.

00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,930
By the end of lunch, connecting on LinkedIn and trading information and I still keep in

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:37,890
contact with a numb of these people.

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,339
The last phase is to end it.

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:45,959
Which is weird to say when you're building connection is to stop talking to somebody.

00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,440
But the value is learning how to say good bye.

00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:52,080
You have a conversation, asking questions, starting to find common ground, talking to

00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,190
the person.

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,269
It's going really well.

00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,870
Great.

00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,620
Collect information and move on to the next conversation.

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,460
You don't want to be that person at beginning of, say, the after party tonight.

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,589
You meet someone now and start talking to them.

00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,010
You don't to be hovering with that person the whole night.

00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:12,490
You're going to miss out on opportunities to talk with people and prevent that person

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,490
from having opportunities.

00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:20,620
On the other side, if you're having a conversation, it's dwindling, throwing too much beach balls.

00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:25,720
You want to stop having that conversation and gracefully move on to a new one.

00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,930
Learn how to say good bye.

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,100
Hey, it was talking to you about X, Y and Z.

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,050
If it wasn't beneficial, say I want to talk to other people now.

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,190
Or, you know, I'm going catch this next talk.

00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,079
It was nice talking to you.

00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,079
Move on.

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,760
Don't just say nice talking to you and walk away.

00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,870
Be polite about it.

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,290
Say something about it.

00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:51,040
If it was a positive conversation, building a connection, say, do you have a card?

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,640
I would like to talk further about A, B and C with you.

00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,980
Go talk to vendors outside.

00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,459
They will do this to you.

00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,950
It's their job.

00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,130
It's good for you too.

00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,730
Get a business card, get information.

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:10,420
I recommend not right in front of you that person, but step aside, grab a pen, what you

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,799
talked about and where you met this person.

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,600
That's going to help with the connection phase, the follow through.

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,650
It's about keeping in touch.

00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:24,199
Say you have a connection, you have asked lots of questions and found a common thread

00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:27,140
that you want to talk about.

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:35,010
And this is someone you want to talk more with, follow up, send them an email.

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,980
Say, like, hey, last week it was great talking with you at DevOpsDays.

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,990
We were talking about Kubernetes and I just read this article about it, have you seen

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,010
it, just wondering and send it to them.

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,140
And their response back and you start building up conversation that way.

00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,600
Connect with LinkedIn, ask them if they want to grab a drink in you're at area.

00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,530
Hey, we both work in the city.

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:57,150
I'm really interested what you were talking about.

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,400
Do you want to grab a coffee and start talking about it?

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,510
Start building up that connection.

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,570
You're now really building up a connection with someone else.

00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,580
Case study.

00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,539
Connecting with Karl.

00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,720
He is the CTO of the great network out of Chicago.

00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,309
Runs a great newsletter, CFP lands that tells you about upcoming speaking opportunities

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:20,440
at technical conferences.

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,620
I met Karl at a technical conference in the city.

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,299
We were both speakers and I sat down next to him at the speaker dinner and employed

00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:34,460
some of the tools I had to learn conversation, why he was there in the city, what he does.

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,460
We found a real connection.

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:40,910
I followed up with Karl and he followed up with me and we kept emailing each other.

00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:46,790
Last year for my podcast was looking for guests and I reached out to Karl, he was a big presenter.

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:52,450
Hey, Karl, I want to do a podcast about public speaking for developers.

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,410
That's a great idea.

00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:58,100
He's based in Chicago.

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,620
I'm coming to Chicago.

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:10,230
Grab a coffee, we had coffee, I did an interview for his newsletter, he was on my podcast.

00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,230
Mutually beneficial.

00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,410
Karl does way better than I do.

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,790
He keeps lists of everyone he meets that is a positive connection.

00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:20,740
And every month picks three people from the list and emails them.

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,670
Not asking for information or going after anything.

00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:30,770
He keeps his connections going that way.

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:31,770
All right.

00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:34,660
So, the three phases of networking.

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,360
The prep phase.

00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,200
Most important thing is any networking situation, have a goal.

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,960
Then adopt a persona, the best version of yourself for that situation.

00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,090
It doesn't have to be who you are.

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:47,680
Be the type of person you want to be and practice that.

00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,760
That's going to be hard to do.

00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,290
And I think that's the hardest thing to do.

00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:54,410
But the more you do it, the more second nature it become opinions start the engagement.

00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:59,730
The three second rule, outrun any anxiety, go into the situation, force yourself to do

00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:00,730
it.

00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:01,730
Be positive.

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,350
Go in with a smile.

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,950
Learn machine's name.

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,710
Keep them engages and they don't be a stranger.

00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,070
And ask questions.

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:12,430
Simple questions, don't ask complex questions.

00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:17,510
Tug at that and ask follow up questions and build a connection.

00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,530
And connect phase, don't linger.

00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:25,960
When it feels like the conversation is ending or you want to move on, politely excuse yourself,

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,780
collect the information and follow up with an email, with LinkedIn message.

00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,660
And then regularly check in with that person.

00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,130
Hopefully see them at another conference.

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,570
Hey, it's great to see you.

00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:43,500
If you're doing that, you're going to keep getting these results of meeting people, finding

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:50,030
something that you both have in common, something that you're both interested in that's related,

00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,789
and if you keep it alive, you're going to find opportunities.

00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:56,960
Ways to reach out to oh, man.

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,280
I have marbles in my mouth.

00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,970
Going to benefit you, benefit that person, benefit your career and your role.

00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,590
And I say go for it.

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:10,650
If I can do this, let me tell you, if I can do this, anybody can do this.

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,010
So, I have a challenge for everybody here.

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:15,660
I know after this talk there is a break.

00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,660
There is coffee.

00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,400
Everyone is going to be out there.

00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,380
Everybody just saw this talk.

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,669
You all have this in common.

00:21:22,669 --> 00:21:23,880
Everybody here is at DevOpsDays.

00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,720
I challenge everyone here to have the goal of meeting one new person, learning their

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,350
name, and finding out why they're at DevOps today.

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:34,080
If you can do that, who knows what opportunities you're going to find.

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,340
And then it makes it easier to go out there for the break and not just sit in the corner

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,680
and not talk to anyone.

00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,170
With that, I have these resources here.

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:50,000
These slides are available at bit.ly/DODConnect I have automated my Tweets today.

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,640
That's going out later.

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,870
We did an episode of the podcast, episode 35, developingup.com/35.

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:05,780
The interview with Karl is smart passive income.com.

00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:15,500
And the last talk, how to win friends and influence people by Dale Carnegie.

00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,700
It's been printed for 90 years.

00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,130
It's a great resource for having conversations with people.

00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:23,440
With that, thank you for having me today.

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,870
I'm excited to be part of DevOpsDays.

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,640
And we have some time for questions.

00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Yeah.

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
[ Applause ] AUDIENCE: Is there supposed

00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,640
MICHAEL: I can hear it.

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,670
Microphones usually make sound.

00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:32,670
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:33,670
There we go, okay.

00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,500
I wasn't sure if it was just for webcast or whatever.

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,409
So, what if you go up to somebody at a networking event and they haven't seen this presentation

00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:44,340
and it's just like trying to draw blood from a stone?

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,159
Do you just cut out and like, thanks for the conversation, I'm out?

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,030
You don't probably say that.

00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:51,330
What do you do?

00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:54,640
MICHAEL: First of all, everyone should see this presentation.

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,120
But in the off chance they haven't, yeah, dig in, ask questions.

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,480
But you'll be able to tell quickly from the body language, if they don't want to engage,

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,179
you don't have to talk with everybody.

00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:11,850
It was great talking with you and just move on.

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,159
Don't just try to keep forcing it.

00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:17,100
If they're not both people have to be involved with it and want to do it.

00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,310
Don't be afraid to move on.

00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:23,670
And I recommend this presentation.

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:25,330
AUDIENCE: Off loud voice.

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,750
How do you use the strategies to talk to your execs?

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,194
Because that's one of the fears I have in my organization.

00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:30,194
MICHAEL: How to use these tragedies to talk to your execs?

00:23:30,194 --> 00:23:32,390
Well, I would say the great thing about that is you both have something in common.

00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:35,610
You both want to deliver value to your business.

00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,120
Start there.

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,900
Start with the real work related items.

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:46,680
Start having a conversation and recognize their days are usually jam packed in my experience.

00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,030
Make them quick conversations.

00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,670
Try to make a lasting impression by something.

00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:54,270
Like what do thing of the work your team is doing.

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,580
Or what's their opinion of how the business is growing.

00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,900
They care about the business value.

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,710
So, start there.

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,419
And build up from that conversation when you see them in the hallway.

00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,470
Don't duck out of the way and be like, oh, no!

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,500
Just have that conversation.

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,010
In my experience with execs, they're people too.

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:16,570
They want to talk with they want no know their business and people in it.

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,279
Start building things related to work.

00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:23,390
And then if you can, move on to a little more personal without being overly personal.

00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:26,620
If you want to connect with them on Facebook, do that.

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,830
Mixed results there depending on your life and their life.

00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,830
Yeah.

00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,860
Talk about business and find opportunities there.

00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:38,330
Good questions.

00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,820
I can take more applause too.

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,220
