Description: 
	Double, Double, Toil and Trouble! Top SRE Practices for DevOps by John Esser

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) originated at Google as a discipline and set of practices to operationalize and scale its services. An SRE values, skills, and approaches does not reflect the typical SysAdmin role so making the shift to SRE is a challenge and a transformation in and of itself. Having built an SRE organization from the ground up, I will outline how to morph an existing operations group to an SRE discipline, the typical challenges of doing so, explain the top SRE practices (e.g. eliminate toil) teams can and should adopt to scale their services, and the mindset needed to effectively work with the developers in the organization. SRE is not operations as usual!
