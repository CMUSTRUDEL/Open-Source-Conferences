Description: 
	Cooperative Economics for Engineers; or, Why You Have More In Common With Pirate Fleets Than With Your Manager by James Meickle

Tech sector employees have historically had few influential unions, professional societies, or other cooperative entities. 2019 may be the year that changes, thanks to the ongoing conversation around game developer working conditions, walkouts at Google protesting inequity and sexual harassment, and the recent collective bargaining victories at “new media” establishments.

Most programmers work in industries with better working conditions, but dig beyond the surface and you can spot some uncomfortable questions. Why are stock options deliberately misleading? Why isn’t there standard on-call compensation? Why is on-the-job training so limited? Why are programmers over 30 considered old? Why are companies so interested in outsourcing, offshoring, and even prison labor?

We need more context to answer some of these uncomfortable questions. Let’s take a lightning-speed tour through the history of cooperative economics, including medieval guilds, Luddites, ship’s articles, the American labor movement, credit unions, rural electrification, communications workers unions, web development co-ops, and community broadband networks. Learn what connects all of these moments in history, and how that very same thread runs through our careers as technologists today. And most importantly, learn why you’re more like a pirate than you ever guessed!

Thank you for coming to my talk, cooperative economics for engineers.

00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:32,360
Or why you have more in common with pirate fleets than with your manager.

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:36,070
So to give you a chance to leave if you need to, just as a content warning, I'll be talking

00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:40,890
a little about religion, a little about death, because you know pirates, but also slavery

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,010
and racism.

00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:45,070
So if that's going to be an uncomfortable topic for you, you have ample opportunity

00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,170
to leave before then.

00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,270
I'm actually not going to be taking questions.

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:54,409
If you want to talk to me about this, come to the open space instead.

00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:57,580
I've put it on the board already.

00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,370
I'm going to tweet these slides as well as some links to some interesting organizations.

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,550
That will happen immediately but there's going to be a video of this and that will be available

00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,420
later.

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,610
Just some other bookkeeping disclaimers.

00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,930
I work at Quantopian but these are all my opinions, they're not the company one.

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,940
I'm also an SRE professional.

00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,280
Please do not take anything I say as investment advice.

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,720
It's not.

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,150
Okay.

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,150
So hi.

00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,860
I'm James and I'm getting over some bronchitis, so I might cough a lot.

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,590
I'm a site reliability engineer working in finance.

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,440
I previously worked in academia, I've done criminal justice work, I've worked in sales.

00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,670
Just kind of all over the map.

00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,340
And I want to start this presentation with a picture of my house.

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,960
I live up in Malden and I took the orange line to get here.

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:59,470
One of the things I'm passionate about in life is cooperative housing and intentional

00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,630
communities.

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,130
That actually started when I got to Boston.

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:08,869
I rented in some places with friends for like six or so years across three different co-ops.

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,070
That means we do things like cooking together as a group, splitting all of our groceries,

00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:15,860
investing in furniture together.

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,980
And you know, I liked it enough I decided the idea I want to buy a house and have all

00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
my friends live in.

00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,220
I just did that.

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,920
There's seven of us, four cats and two snakes right now.

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,010
But we're going to be expanding and that works really well for me.

00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:32,590
I really follow that area pretty closely.

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:35,989
And as you can imagine, the people who are in the cooperative housing are into some other

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,560
stuff and one of those things they're into is labor organizing.

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,099
There's a pretty close relationship between these groups.

00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:45,379
Now I want to ask you all a question.

00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:47,579
Who has a laptop that looks like that?

00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:49,879
Raise your hand.

00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,579
Now, if you had your hand raised, raise your hand if it has a union sticker on it.

00:02:55,579 --> 00:02:59,609
I don't see a single hand in the audience.

00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:02,640
That's what a construction worker's helmet looks like.

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,860
They have stickers all over the place.

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,329
If you asked in a workplace there might be a unanimous show of hands.

00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,110
So why is tech different?

00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,010
Well, it's actually not just unions.

00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:22,529
There's all sorts of different forms of organizing labor or having labor happen cooperatively

00:03:22,529 --> 00:03:26,319
or as a collective and tech workers don't do any of them.

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,939
It's not just unions.

00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:34,269
But in 2019 we're really starting to see some signs of that changing.

00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:41,169
After years of crunch and deadlines and abuse from management, workers in the gaming industry

00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:44,620
are actually starting to walk out, starting to really take seriously the idea of forming

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,829
game development unions.

00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:52,029
Employees at Google have much better working conditions, but they're still facing harassment

00:03:52,029 --> 00:03:57,120
inside the workplace and they had a major walkout over both that as well as Google's

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,909
military contracts.

00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,900
In fact, this has been ongoing.

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,440
After the walk-out there has been so much political discussion in Google that Google

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,180
tried to tell employees to stop talking about politics at work which is actually illegal

00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,450
so the government had to come in and tell them not to do that.

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,299
We may not think of these as tech, but a lot of these media establishments, they are tech

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,780
companies that happen to do journalism and some of them are starting to unionize as well.

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,570
There's BuzzFeed and also Vox.

00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:37,660
And really close to home, NPM had a unionization drive and they lost several senior engineers

00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,530
to firings there as a result of this and many more quit in solidarity.

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,630
They've also lost I think their CEO at this point.

00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,370
So it's been an ongoing struggle.

00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,770
Just before I started working on the slides, this happened at Kick starter as well.

00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:56,289
There have actually been some kickstarter projects that were halfway through funding

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:05,720
to show solidarity they pulled off and went to competitors.

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,400
In California we have the other side of this.

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,040
We see the things that are internal to tech companies, but they see okay, what's a tech

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:17,409
company like Lyft or Uber doing to the economy for people who are not programmers.

00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:21,960
And they decided they don't actually want to have an economy where people are just contractors

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,760
with no benefits.

00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,530
So they passed a law that really changes the game for these gig economy employees, which

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,599
Uber is trying to contest.

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:33,900
They're trying to say they're actually not in the business of driving, by the way.

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,930
One that may be closer to home for some folks.

00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,770
There have been a lot of organizations talking about the role of tech in the concentration

00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:47,139
camps along the border.

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:51,689
Palantir has gotten a lot of attention for this because they're producing the architecture

00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:57,889
that's helping ICE find specific people they're going to deport, where their family is going

00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:58,889
to be.

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:00,030
They're facilitating this.

00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:02,389
They've faced a lot of protest.

00:06:02,389 --> 00:06:08,560
A lot of students at the higher-tier schools are actually saying out of school when we

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
have our choice of jobs, we refuse to work with Palantir.

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,240
We're not going to consider them.

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,050
Amazon has also faced a lot of criticism over this.

00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,940
Because a lot of the backbone that ICE is using, the technological services, they're

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,800
all hosted on AWS.

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,970
That was all from 2019.

00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,560
There was almost nothing like this in previous years.

00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,819
There was some smaller stories, but the idea that we have story after story after story

00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:39,180
of really big labor movements happening in tech is actually something pretty new and

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,310
pretty interesting.

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,750
So I see this as kind of the beginning of the end of the status quo.

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,539
You know, a lot of people in tech think of themselves as not political or they're not

00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:50,610
involved in causes.

00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,099
And I think society is actually saying well, you don't have that option anymore, even if

00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:59,750
you choose to be non-political, we're going to make your job political.

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:03,330
So the question is, what is tech labor going to look like in the future?

00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:07,400
Is it going to look like someone working on a construction site with a union stickered

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,419
hard hat or are we just going to put more stickers on our laptops.

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:14,039
I don't think that's the way tech is going to go.

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,050
But to really understand what it might look like, I want to take a look at history and

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,250
see what various labor movements in history have looked like, because the answer is it's

00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,250
not always been unions.

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,800
They're a fairly modern invention.

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,860
So if you really like history, just cover your ears for the next 10 minutes.

00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,689
I'm going to get a lot of stuff wrong because I'm trying to compress about 2,000 years into

00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,830
like 10 minutes.

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,800
So you might think that I would actually start with this guy, if you know who he is.

00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,289
But he's like 10 minutes away.

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,199
[ Laughter ] We're starting here actually.

00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,280
We're going to start in Rome.

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,430
This is the Roman empire at the peak of its borders.

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,740
One of the largest empires the world has ever seen.

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:57,360
They've built marvels that last to this day.

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,750
Their slaves built them.

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:06,750
The Roman Empire was something like 30% slaves.

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,020
There's argument how badly they were treated but ultimately they didn't want to be doing

00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,949
those jobs.

00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,819
So there were occasional slave revolts and sometimes what this would look like is effectively

00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:19,099
an entire city falling to slaves.

00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,699
I'm not talking about the slaves refusing to work, I'm talking about the slaves raiding

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,350
the city, sizing the art and marching on neighboring cities.

00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,580
That's what a slave rebellion looked like in Rome.

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,080
They really didn't like them.

00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,590
There was popular media that portrayed it as something awful to society.

00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,050
It was very engrained that the slave resistance was illegitimate.

00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:48,640
The thing with an empire that big it took weeks for news to cross something like that

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,580
even if you used a courier.

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,600
So it was really hard to have empire-wide rebellion.

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,310
They were one city at a time, an army would come and put them down and they kept happening

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,970
but they weren't a threat to the stability of the whole empire.

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:09,950
What did end up being a threat in some ways was early Christianity.

00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:15,480
So around 1CE, that's what religion looked like in the Roman empire.

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,830
And actually you can see there were a lot of different religions that were very popular.

00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:22,030
Christianity hadn't spread very far.

00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:26,890
The Roman Empire was used to there being multiple religions.

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,140
That's not why Roman Empire came out against Christianity in some ways.

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,560
It actually has more to do with the Doctrine.

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,070
Because in the Roman Empire you were allowed freedom of religion as long as you acknowledged

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:43,460
that the Roman government was essentially the highest actor.

00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,230
And that was something that Christianity did not agree to and that's what made it more

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,530
of a threat.

00:09:48,530 --> 00:10:00,590
Because it said that people were equally worthwhile whether you were a slave or an emperor.

00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:06,200
So in response to this kind of doctrine, what did those emperors do?

00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,590
They actually converted.

00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,500
The Roman emperors switched over to Christianity and made that the state religion instead.

00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:18,470
It was a co-opation with this social movement that was popular with the lower classes, they

00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:27,010
cut it off at the pass before it became a revolutionary movement.

00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,980
Did it work?

00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,680
Not really.

00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,860
There's a postmortem if you want to read about it.

00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,220
[ Laughter ] But we're going to skip ahead to about the

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,230
700s to the 1400s.

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,290
What's commonly known as the middle ages.

00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,400
You might know them as the dark ages.

00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,230
They're called that because there isn't as much historical documentation.

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,690
Not because they were.

00:10:54,690 --> 00:11:07,980
The Romans Vassals, Catholicism was a major power and labor relations really looked different.

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:14,830
It's not a Roman emperor controlling land, it's not republican officials.

00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,240
It's actually like individual families start owning land.

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,970
And it's based on labor relations that are like social ties.

00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:25,080
Things like marriages or land ownership.

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,740
So we call this system feudalism.

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:33,690
Under the feudal system most people were peasants and most of those pass ants are what we call

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,690
serfs.

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:40,350
And a serf was essentially a form of slavery.

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,980
You could be bought and sold as part of the land you were on and you would pay rent to

00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,940
some lord just for the idea of existing.

00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:50,570
But not every peasant was a serf.

00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,340
Actually there were a lot of skilled craftspeople in this era.

00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,570
There really started to be innovations in metalsmithing and glass working.

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,300
And you know those workers in today's terms, they worked at union shops.

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,980
They had what were called guilds.

00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,390
Medieval guilds were a predecessor what we consider a union today.

00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:16,050
They would take you in, train you, have clear goals what you would need to do, training

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:22,940
and they would take care of you if you got sick they would pay your bills, if you died

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:25,180
they would take care of your family.

00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,270
They were like a cooperative society of people who were all in the same trade together.

00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,170
There were also local institutions.

00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:35,690
This is how some medieval institutions got really known for an industry.

00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:41,550
This is the city where we do our mirror making or glass-blowing because they had these strong

00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:43,150
development organizations.

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:46,120
These guilds also self-regulated.

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:50,420
Because they ran on the reputation of their craftspeople, you had to mark all of your

00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:55,300
goods from being made in this particular guild, this particular craftsperson.

00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,990
If you sold bad goods, your guild would take you to account.

00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,670
There weren't police officers at this time in history, you were just accountable tow

00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,510
other craftspeople in your industry, in your town that's how people made quality goods

00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,140
in that era and that's how the technology started increasing.

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,510
So at the same time that these craftspeople are laying the foundation for the industrial

00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:25,280
revolution, they're making all these high-quality crafts and they have to sell them somewhere

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,720
so they turn to merchants.

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,210
They start trading more goods and interesting goods farther away.

00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:36,700
There is starts to be more of a system of international commerce.

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,040
They don't know it yet, but they're inventing the technology that will lay the groundwork

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
for capitalism.

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:47,493
If I say technology, you might think oh, ships or wagons what was it, sailing ships?

00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,810
It was actually social contract.

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:53,260
It's contract law.

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,450
So this is the era that we really get the idea of modern contract law from.

00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:05,730
This is what's known as lex Mercatria or the law of merchants, which is the same sort of

00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:08,240
phrase as like inspector general or heir apparent.

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,360
It is the set of laws dealing with merchants.

00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,410
And when I say laws, it was actually a little less formal than that.

00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,580
It was a set of agreements between various merchants between how they would conduct themselves

00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,670
an what they would do if there was some disagreement.

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,160
It was international.

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,680
At this time in Europe these kingdoms weren't very powerful or centralized so you were doing

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:34,310
trading with cities was common in that era.

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,110
What made it work was this was industry self-regulation.

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:43,160
All of these merchants had an idea of what they wanted competition to look like, what

00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,080
they thought was fair, what they thought was unfair.

00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,200
And if you sought recourse, it was your peers who were judging you.

00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,380
There was a strong incentive for everyone to collaborate to come up new and better rules

00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,220
and to standardize them.

00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,920
If you were in England and your goods were in what would become Turkey, you could get

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,340
recourse for someone screwing you over there.

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,800
You have a good idea of how the system would work.

00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,370
So if you think that this self-governing contract law thing sounds a like open source licensing,

00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,780
there's some similarities there.

00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:24,370
So during the middle ages we had these cool solve-governing commerce systems and they

00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:27,940
drove us to this modern system of capitalism.

00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,260
So why don't we have them today?

00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,030
You don't see people in guilds anymore.

00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:39,170
Before the renaissance, before the industrial revolution, we began to see a process of increasing

00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,390
control.

00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:44,320
What happened is these merchants were so successful that they started thinking of ways to get

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,400
more tariffs out of them, more taxes.

00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,940
What's a good way to do that?

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
Have a border.

00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,150
What do you have to have to have a border?

00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,130
You have to have a centralized nation.

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,810
So we really started to invent nationalism in this area colonialism.

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:03,700
It spread all across the world, it devastated ecosystems and led to slavery and genocide.

00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,790
A lot of people weren't happy with this.

00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:12,590
And if you weren't, fuck it, become a pirate.

00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:16,890
You see, piracy was really high risk in this area.

00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,810
But it was also really high reward.

00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,980
It's actually kind of the closest thing to a start-up in that era.

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,320
A lot of merchants traveled the world, and some of those merchants would be commissioned

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,130
to attack other merchants, this would become privateers and some of them would freelance

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:38,450
and attack anyone in some cases the merchants would get captured by the pirates and decide

00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,790
to go into piracy.

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:45,620
Some of those converted pirates then became pirate captains of their own.

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,420
There's historical records of specific people this happened to.

00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,620
It wasn't just merchants.

00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:56,600
The world had moved on now we had standing armies and there were deserters from them.

00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,360
There were slaves in the Caribbean, both black and indigenous people and many of those people

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,230
if they escaped would turn to piracy because they could stay free.

00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,439
And if you were a queer person, well, the church had kind of cracked down in Europe

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,679
and there wasn't the Bay Area yet, so why not try international piracy.

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,919
So you had a lot of people that needed to work together on these pirate ships, all different

00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,150
walks of life, and there was already a cool system for this.

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,740
Contract law.

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,540
All these merchant ships used the law of merchants to have a contract of everyone on that ship

00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,200
agreeing what they were going to do, what they were going to get paid and how long they

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,710
were going to stay on the ship.

00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:46,320
The port that the ship is coming from is Providence and it's going to Africa.

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,840
This is the charter from a slave ship.

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,470
Slavery was a huge deal in New England.

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,030
We didn't have as many slaves physically present here but we were the power brokers and traders

00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,400
of slavery.

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,590
Now, because so many pirates had previously been involved with merchants, they knew about

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,300
these ship codes.

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,570
So they adopted them and became pirate codes.

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:11,260
Same sort of deal but they would also govern your share of the treasure.

00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,570
As it turns out, those shares are pretty generous.

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:18,590
Like I think your CEO is probably making one and a half more times than what you're making.

00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,590
No golden parachutes either.

00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:28,690
If a ship got captured, the captain got hanged.

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,140
No golden parachutes.

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:35,290
Pirates also had a right to vote.

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,020
In some ways, pirate ships were the most democratic institution of this time we didn't have modern

00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,940
concepts of democracy yet.

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,970
Also pirates were really good to their contracted employees.

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,510
They actually gave them health care.

00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:55,030
If you lost a limb you would get compensated an amount that had been predetermined.

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:01,290
This is the reason why so much pirate media in popular culture has peg legs and eye patches

00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:02,960
and hook hands.

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,840
Because they were the least shitty people to disabled people among them.

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,430
[ Laughter ] And if you're one of those people who complains

00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:17,040
about codes of conduct at events like this, pirates have you beat by 400 years.

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,860
[ Laughter ] So the golden age of piracy did end.

00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,330
We do still have pirates today.

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:28,120
They're not the most democratic institution anymore, unless you count the pirate party.

00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,620
Back in Europe, the industrial revolution had started.

00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:36,150
It brought prosperity to a lot of people but it brought misery to others and many of our

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,730
modern labor movements draw their origins from the industrial revolution.

00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:47,450
One of the first well-known groups of organized resistance were the Luddites.

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:52,450
You usually think of it as an insult.

00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:53,450
That's not really who the Luddites were.

00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:55,470
They were skilled craftspeople.

00:19:55,470 --> 00:20:00,620
The same kinds of people who would have joined guilds in the medieval area and everyone in

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,270
their town needed their skills.

00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,920
Rich and poor, you all needed clothes.

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,090
So the new looms that were being brought in to these factories, they were known as stocking

00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,090
frames.

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,300
If you look closely, do you see what those things are?

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,300
They're punch cards.

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,530
These were the predecessors to modern computer.

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:24,220
The first computer program was for the analytical engine which would have been one of these

00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,140
just with some better conversion to do better math.

00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:32,559
Luddites figured this out quickly.

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,350
What they figured out is that the factory owners were the only people who would benefit

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,350
from this.

00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,360
That all of their jobs would be at risk.

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,990
That it would be lower quality goods, harsher working conditions, that they would lose the

00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:48,920
control and status in their communities because of it.

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,230
So they smashed them.

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,900
It didn't take long for factory owners to start smashing back it started with your factory

00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,710
owner would just shoot you for destroying that and get away with it.

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,770
Then they started turning to government.

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:05,500
They made up this new crime called frame breaking.

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,811
And frame breaking at some points was a capital offense to destroy this machine because it

00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:13,520
was so critical to England's economic development.

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:20,630
In a lot of ways, frame breaking parallels computer crimes in the United States.

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,010
Wide ranging legislation making something highly he bill law it's in the interest of

00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:32,880
economic develop: We've seen the same thing happen to railroads and oil pipelines.

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,650
It's seen as threatening America's infrastructure.

00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:42,920
And I would expect within 10 years, I'm surprised it hasn't happened already, to see legislation

00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,520
along these lines targeting cloud systems or AI systems, making it specifically illegal

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,300
to interfere in their operation.

00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:56,320
If you've been following what's been happening with the Chef and ICE connection, the revocation

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,970
of the gem from Ruby gems.

00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,250
A lot of people have applauded chef from doing this, from taking this down and preventing

00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,060
people to use it.

00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:10,450
I want you to consider, what about a future where this would end up carrying a prison

00:22:10,450 --> 00:22:13,230
sentence?

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,080
It is ahistorical that you can do this and not get in trouble.

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,450
So Luddites were just one of movements during the industrial revolution and as it progressed

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,809
we started seeing something like modern nations.

00:22:25,809 --> 00:22:32,380
And during these poor working conditions, living in cities, you started to see a lot

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,500
of political philosophy and Karl Marx is one of the most prominent authors in this era.

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,420
And one of the misunderstandings is this idea that Marxism is un-American.

00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:51,510
That actually corresponded Lincoln because Marxists were against slavery.

00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:57,340
Marx's legacy was to introduce the world to the idea as economic classes as some you can

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,870
study and economic classes as something that would fight against each other for their interests.

00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:07,410
I'm not going to talk about revolutionary Marxism, this guy is not appearing.

00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:11,990
But I'm going to talk about what other people did with it, which was unionism.

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,340
That's really when unionism started kicking off once you had the idea of class struggle.

00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,190
And we remember unions because they gave us the 8-hour workday.

00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,750
They gave us an end to child labor.

00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:26,020
They gave us the 5-day workweek.

00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,630
But we often don't remember what unions had to do to get there.

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,050
See that?

00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:32,900
That's what union marches used to look like.

00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,180
A picket line now doesn't look like that.

00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:43,720
For a long time you had no right to join a union and that meant they had to conceal their

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,300
membership, they had to destroy property, they had to physically beat people trying

00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,530
to cross picket lines rather than just shouting at them.

00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:54,460
They're actually very violent organizations in some way because they were fighting for

00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,510
a cause they believed in.

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,290
They didn't want their children to die in the mines.

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,470
But it's also important to note that unions were in many ways very racist and exclusionary

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,470
organizations.

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,260
I just kicked over my water.

00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,260
Oops.

00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:19,170
So this is actually a historical document with unions backs the Chinese Exclusion Act.

00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:23,570
Unions made a lot of compromises like these with power and that's why we still have them

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,570
today.

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,110
Because they got less and less radical as they got more and more integrated with society.

00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:34,080
So because unions have been so weakened and siloed and have lost membership, a lot of

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,590
people don't trust them anymore.

00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:46,312
It's much cheaper to fire a spreadsheet or an independent contractor than a white collar

00:24:46,312 --> 00:24:47,312
worker.

00:24:47,312 --> 00:24:48,510
But labor history isn't just about Marx.

00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,730
It's also about anarchism.

00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,660
It's also where we get the cooperative movement.

00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,940
We have producer cooperatives.

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,790
Interesting ocean spray is a worker-owned organization.

00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:09,770
Any time you're buying cranberries from them, it was produced by people in a cooperative.

00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:15,010
If you've ever been to the Harvard cooperative society and it was founded for students to

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:18,910
buy cheap textbooks.

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:25,070
So we haven't actively suppressed software cooperatives in the same way, but they're

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,800
also not widely available.

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,860
There's no cooperative you can join as an open source developer to get money any time

00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,010
someone uses your software.

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:35,020
That just doesn't exist as a concept.

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,290
To a great degree, this is the way that the owners of tech companies want it.

00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,980
Because the owners of tech companies aren't just anti-union, they're also anti-protest,

00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,620
antiboycott, antiownership.

00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,059
Here's the CEO of Wayfair saying we don't want political employees.

00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:57,140
Definitely going to be a lawsuit over that.

00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:00,790
I added this slide while I was in the audience.

00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:03,620
That's why it's a phone screen shot.

00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,820
Domino's is launching this expensive campaign to go to the supreme court to say we don't

00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,130
have to be accessible to blind people on their website.

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:12,309
It's not because of the cost.

00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:13,880
The layers are much more expensive.

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,580
They're doing this because they don't want to be forced to do that.

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,830
They want to say we don't care about these people.

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:26,160
So I'm not going to tell you which organization to join, which book to read.

00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,110
Really, the first step in labor organizing isn't reading a particular book.

00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,440
You don't have to read the communist manifesto.

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,750
The first step is you are a worker, that workers have fought for their own rights and needs

00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,820
and maybe your own rights and needs aren't being met.

00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:48,270
Think about next time you sign up for an app, think about who it's putting out of business

00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,230
and whether you help them if they decided to smash servers and the next time you think

00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,590
of a coworker fired without explanation, think about if they had been in a guild, would they

00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,190
still have health care.

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:03,360
Most importantly, if your employer is unethical and you want help changing jobs, reach out.

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:08,090
I know hundreds of people who would be happy to help you.

00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:14,179
So I'll leave you with the words of the beloved anarchist Ursula K. Leguin.

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:21,500
She gave this talk at a publisher's conference where she was receiving an award because the

00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,540
publishers were making a deal with Amazon to undercut their authors.

00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,360
She said that.

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,630
I hope you'll understand that's a deal with Amazon.

00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,960
It's not just about capitalism.

00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,960
It's also about tech.

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,540
I hope you read these words and take them to heart.

00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,540
Thank you.

00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:43,770
I'm going to have all these slides up on Twitter along with some cool links if you want to

00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,380
talk about this afterwards, come to the open space which I think is at 2:00.

00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,380
Thank you all very much.

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:48,520
