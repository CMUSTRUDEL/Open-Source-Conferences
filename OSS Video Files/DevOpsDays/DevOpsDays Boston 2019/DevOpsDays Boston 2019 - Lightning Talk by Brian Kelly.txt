Hi!

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,230
Brian Kelly from Cyber Ark.

00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,500
I'm going to talk about sustainable development.

00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,170
Does anybody here like being stressed out?

00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,270
Who put up their hand.

00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,160
Does anybody like being overworked and working weekends and having no time for family and

00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,160
friends?

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,160
It sucks.

00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,420
Nobody likes to do that.

00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,050
Those things not only just suck, but they make our job of engineering an creativity

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,399
extremely hard.

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,520
There is a part of the agile manifesto that's usually overlooked.

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,239
Here's what it says.

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,210
Agile processes promote sustainable development, which means the sponsors should be able to

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:04,360
maintain a constant pace indefinitely why does that not work in agile environments?

00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,900
Because of the management and employee power imbalance.

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,230
The power dynamic makes it difficult.

00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:15,190
What I want to do is I'm on a personal mission and a professional mission for the last few

00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,571
years, but I will continue until I retire, is to make this a thing and pull that out

00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:26,500
of the agile manifesto and give it a broader awareness so that we can make this something

00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,980
that we will actually fix as an industry.

00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,340
And we do that by making it explicit between employers -- employers and employees about

00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,990
their work expectations and what it's like to be on that team.

00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,630
I have found in my experience naming something is super important.

00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,210
And names tend to performate our lives pretty effectively.

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,880
Where is scrum shop.

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,910
We built 12-factor apps, et cetera et cetera.

00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,500
So I'm going to give it a name.

00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,800
And that's sustainable development.

00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,640
Oh, you're a scrum shop?

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Yeah.

00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,640
Do you practice sustainable development?

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Yes, we do.

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,300
That is a thing I want the industry to adopt.

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,769
Because getting burned out, sucks.

00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:16,069
Having to leave an employer because it sucks to work there, also sucks.

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,599
All those things just suck.

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,769
I've spent a lot of time refactoring this down into three simple principles.

00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,739
We can't be super prescriptive about this, you can't say everybody has to work 9:00 to

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,939
5:00 because the teams that don't want to work 9:00 to 5:00 won't adopt it.

00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:37,760
The principles are number one, you define them.

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,379
You collectively, and the first word is very important, managers and employees together,

00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,880
collectively define their practices.

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,109
They state them and they put them somewhere and write them down.

00:02:49,109 --> 00:02:54,799
Then they follow them, which hopefully is obvious, but it still bears pointing out.

00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,760
And then they continually improve them.

00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,750
Refine them, make them better.

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:02,660
Here's an example of some sample practices.

00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,329
These are the ones, or as a little puzzle for you.

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:09,319
Most of these are how we operate on our team.

00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:12,049
These are some of our sustainable development practices.

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:15,799
And if you want to find out which ones are not, come to our booth or talk to anybody

00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:18,439
who's going to raise their hands right now and say they're part of my team.

00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,040
They're up there.

00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,799
Things like you are incentivized to not check in when you are on vacation.

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,029
If you do we're going to have a performance management discussion at your appraisal.

00:03:29,029 --> 00:03:36,279
Then you're setting the tone it's expected to not take a vacation not disconnect.

00:03:36,279 --> 00:03:41,659
We don't schedule meetings on Fridays, or you're empowered as an engineered to give

00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:46,989
back pressure to management, when terrible planning somewhere else or somewhere up the

00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,810
chain has made your life suck.

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:56,749
So all of these things, these are just examples as sort of like the principles you can adopt

00:03:56,749 --> 00:04:00,840
right now, or you can adapt, you can write your own.

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,840
Last-minute.

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,599
If you're an engineer and you want to adopt these, great.

00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,980
Get your manager on board.

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:06,980
Help roll it out.

00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:12,299
But what I would really like to see is for people to ask for this in interviewing.

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,459
Say hey, you know, your recruiter gave me all this great stuff.

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:16,459
It sounds awesome.

00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:18,879
Are you practicing sustainable development?

00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:19,879
What's that?

00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,359
Let me tell you.

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,180
Even if you don't want to use the term, use the concepts.

00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:30,140
Could you show me your written-down explicit expectations for being online, being reachable

00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,370
on slack, whatever?

00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,919
Oh, everybody knows -- no, could you just write it down for me.

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,210
And there you go, you're starting on that path.

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,560
If you're a manager, work with your team.

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,150
And demonstrate it and follow it yourself.

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,210
It does no good if you're a manager and disregard it and violate all these practices that you've

00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:49,300
written down.

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,750
And use it for hiring purposes.

00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,750
Promote it.

00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,750
We do.

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,840
You know, when we're recruiting people we're touting the fact that we're doing our best

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,280
to avoid burnout.

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,229
There's a website.

00:05:05,229 --> 00:05:07,320
I'm the world's worst CSS developer.

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,199
It's open source, please make it look better.

00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:19,389
It's sustainabledev.org and I would love to get more input, feedback on it.

00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:23,100
You can reach me on Twitter or for at the rest of the afternoon I'll be at the Cyber

00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Ark booth.

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,629
I went 30 seconds over I apologize.

00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,629
Thank you very much.

00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:26,630
