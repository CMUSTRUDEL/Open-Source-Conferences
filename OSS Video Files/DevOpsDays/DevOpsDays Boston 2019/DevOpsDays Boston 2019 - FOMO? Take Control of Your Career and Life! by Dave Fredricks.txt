	FOMO? Take Control of Your Career and Life! by Dave Fredricks

Our industry has been exploding! This has been amazing for growth and financial advancement of the industry, but comes with a huge negative cost to the workforce.

IME the technical workforce has been the most negatively impacted by this great expansion. When business demands (constantly) exceed capacity, strong leadership must be present to prioritize initiatives to mitigate downstream impacts. Unfortunately, important services for the workforce tend to be the first to go, widening the gap for developing future leaders and technical SME.

Currently, our technological advancement is outpacing our ability to develop the current technical workforce, creating more constraints and disparity among the engineering communities. How can we help to solve this critical issue and maintain the control over our own development and career advancement?

We must EMPOWER every engineer with the information and knowledge to create, implement and execute their own PDP.

This is why I want to drive home the message that everyone is responsible for THEIR own professional development.

My talk will cover:

• What is a professional development plan (PDP)? • When do you need a PDP? • How do you start a PDP? • Why is a PDP so important? • Who needs to be involved?

Professional planning is a journey. The more individuals learn, the more aware they become of what is valuable to them. This is why it is extremely important to emphasize the value that comes from going through the process.

Setting up a PDP Framework:

• Continuing Education • Skills Training • EQ • Professional Networking

Laura, thank you so much.

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:17,960
What a great introduction.

00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,960
Hello, welcome.

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,960
It's really great to be here.

00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,200
I appreciate you guys joining me for this talk.

00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:30,090
Quickly, just FOMO, taking control of your career and your life.

00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,960
So just a quick thing.

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,800
So who am I?

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,470
Founder/managing director of engineer working to support work force.

00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:49,469
That picture of my two girls, Lyla and Deven, my wife owner and operators of Pilates Back

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:56,219
Bay, if you guys are open to building up that core, go check her out.

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:05,720
A big-time contributor and community member for Boston DevOps network and DOD member and

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,180
organizer since 2014.

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:12,520
Just a quick couple of notes about me.

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,030
Background to give you some context.

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:21,550
Operation management, huge believer in teaching and learning for life.

00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:26,490
When you learn with the expectation of teaching others because you'll take a deeper dive into

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,700
the new information that's being processed.

00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,680
Professional networking I feel is each and everyone of our responsibilities for that

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,740
safety net.

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,630
Community engagement, always trying to give back in any way I can.

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,780
My thoughts here for DevOps is it's a culture and a thought process for how people collaborate

00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,600
to create and deliver value for teams an business.

00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,490
So FOMO.

00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:59,990
The goal for my talk today is to empower each of you with the knowledge and tools to blaze

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,090
your own path and take control of your career through self-evaluation, goal-setting, and

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:09,550
the execution of a well-designed development plan.

00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,870
To bring you from the dark side, into the light.

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,340
The goal is to Hulk smash that FOMO.

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:24,209
Before we jump into how professional development planning can help you, let's define what FOMO

00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:26,219
really means.

00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:28,629
The fear of missing out.

00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,150
In the majority of the cases FOMO stems from a feeling or sense of aimless wandering in

00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,540
our lives and career.

00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,590
This lack of direction manifests itself into feelings of helplessness that make us more

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,049
reactionary to people and events around us.

00:02:45,049 --> 00:02:55,760
When folks feel this lack of control, negative patterns develop downstream.

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,189
So you become a product of your environment with very little influence to control your

00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:07,580
personal growth, professional contribution, and/or career decisions.

00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:15,680
Folks who deal with FOMO typically find themselves in these path logic or buyer crate I can.

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,379
It's the ultimate desire and effect of leadership.

00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:25,610
Trying to navigate out of one of these organizations while avoiding other pitfalls is extremely

00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,620
challenging and a scary experience.

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,390
Especially if you don't have a plan on how you're going to accomplish this.

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,989
Our industry has been exploding.

00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:35,989
We all know this.

00:03:35,989 --> 00:03:41,419
Half the talks were about who's hiring and leave there to come here, right?

00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:47,469
You know, it's been amazing for growth and financial advancement in the industry.

00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,599
But what has it done to the workforce?

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,169
In my experience the technical workforce has been the most negatively impacted by this

00:03:54,169 --> 00:03:56,249
expansion.

00:03:56,249 --> 00:04:02,150
When business has constantly exceeded the skill of capacity, we end up having to take

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,950
shortcuts.

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:09,090
And unfortunately from my experience and from what I've seen, that falls on the development

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,700
and growth of the workforce.

00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,830
So let's take a look at some of these examples.

00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:24,680
Many of us turn to our managers for help and guidance, right?

00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,979
When you put your career in others' hands, where do you think you're going to end up?

00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:31,259
This is one of my managers.

00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:36,139
You know, angry at me for asking stupid questions.

00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:42,160
Angry at taking control and actions into my own hands.

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,030
Or this character.

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:52,930
Constantly telling me how to do my job, but doesn't really know what my job is.

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,830
You think to yourself awesome, okay.

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,020
You know what?

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,620
Hey, it's not from leadership, at least I have my teammates to lean on for help.

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,030
Whoops.

00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,030
Looks like everybody left.

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,450
Some people went over to see Brian Kelly at conjure.

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,479
Everyone I looked who could help me is no longer around.

00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,039
Now I'm left with these jokers.

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,630
That person hates fixing problems.

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,580
Honestly, I don't even know what the person does.

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,580
Does anybody?

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,160
They're still around.

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,889
Sorry.

00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:25,889
Not my problem.

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:27,069
Well, whose problem is it?

00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:31,750
Not my problem.

00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:39,020
Have you ever been accountable for anything?

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,520
What about them.

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,580
Every escalation runs through them by design.

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,690
Management literally gave them the keys to the castle to be a single point of failure

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:56,599
and you're thinking to yourself I'm going to be working with these folks to make this

00:05:56,599 --> 00:06:00,319
journey and transformation.

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,680
What do you think is going to happen next if you stick around in this state?

00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,949
Overworked.

00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:11,490
No control.

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:14,120
Misaligned rewards.

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,110
A community that is not supportive.

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:27,810
The values do not align with the organization with or the leadership that you follow.

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,880
This is the definition of burnout.

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,870
This is a great piece that I actually shared through a slack channel through our community

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:47,259
by Elizabeth Grace Saunders check it out through Harvard Business Review.

00:06:47,259 --> 00:06:51,920
If you find that some of these ideas kind of resonate with you, right, fear not.

00:06:51,920 --> 00:07:01,360
Because I'll tell you, there is a way to regain your control and reenergize your life.

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,699
A professional development plan.

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:05,710
Let's define what that means.

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,930
This is from wiki I took out of September 20, 2017.

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:17,330
A PDP is a framework or a guide used to document specific goals and set out a strategy on how

00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,660
to meet those goals.

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:28,800
So the first step in any plan or journey or transformation, define the goal.

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,159
Steven Covey, seven habits of highly effective people, highly suggest that book.

00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:38,770
Rule 2.

00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,950
For most of us knowing our destination might not be perfectly clear.

00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,250
That's okay.

00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,819
We can take some assumptions as to where we want to go.

00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:53,639
This being DevOps Days, what I like to do is look at some of the influential leaders

00:07:53,639 --> 00:08:02,919
and focus on some of their developments, they focused on what we called the AAAs.

00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:06,080
It's attitude, aptitude, awareness.

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:12,319
How I perceive the world around me, how I react to those views, how I engage with the

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,509
people around me, and how I react to those engagements.

00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:18,949
It's a state of mind.

00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:22,289
Your aptitude, the ability for problem-solving.

00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:27,680
Being able to pick up new learnings and ideas, design, et cetera.

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
Awareness.

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,380
My ability to read between the lines.

00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:34,930
I feel like this is such an important characteristic in DevOps.

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,039
Identify people's motivations quickly.

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,349
Understand downstream effects of technical solutions and team behaviors.

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,019
So the three A's are for attitude.

00:08:47,019 --> 00:08:50,130
Be positive, be tenacious, yet humble.

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,560
Aptitude, your technical skills, being solutions driven and your mindset, teaching and learning,

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,320
a way of life.

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,470
Awareness, empathy, relationship building.

00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:06,360
An open listener in a community-engaged networker.

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,680
So some folks may be thinking to themselves, I can't change who I am.

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,690
Those AAAs are character traits or personality reactions, right?

00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:21,450
The AAA is not about changing who you are.

00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:26,170
It's about knowing who you are and what areas of opportunity you should be focusing on to

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,420
better yourself, and this is what your plan is for.

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:40,000
Remember, your PDP is your plan, created by you, for a result and a destination that you

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,589
want to take.

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:47,380
So since we have some -- and you know, end thoughts in mind, our destination, we kind

00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,589
of have an idea what's the next step.

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:54,820
We need to figure out where we start from.

00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,730
And these are the questions I like to ask.

00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,940
Where do I begin?

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,820
You have to know thyself.

00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,440
What are my strengths and opportunities?

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,839
What is important to me?

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,430
And why do I feel these ways.

00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,150
Your motivators are dryers.

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:16,779
It's hugely important for people to think about this deeply to be honest with yourself.

00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:20,940
Some of you may already have this information answered.

00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:25,990
For those of you that may not, that are unclear, there are some great online resources for

00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:27,180
an objective view.

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:31,699
I like to use different personality assessments online.

00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:39,670
If you guys are familiar with DiSC assessment or Myers-Briggs.

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,430
These provide a baseline understanding as to who you are and they give you an example

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,940
of if I'm this character trait speaking to these people, this is how I should try to

00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:56,250
vocalize my thoughts and ideas, versus ABCD type person.

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:01,839
Also muse.com is a great resource online.

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,889
Highly suggest for anyone interested.

00:11:03,889 --> 00:11:05,350
All right.

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:10,019
So we've got our start, we got some ideas as to where we're heading.

00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:13,910
Now we've got to create the tasks for the pathways there.

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,779
We do that by setting goals.

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:23,279
Our goals are individual directives in our plan to get us to our destination, similar

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,220
to the type of turns that we need to take during navigation.

00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:32,000
Each goal needs to be, and I know you guys have heard this already, specific, measurable,

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,020
actual, realistic and time boxed.

00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,079
These are hugely important.

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:43,269
If you're taking on any kind of task for a new directive, in DevOps we have to measure,

00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:50,320
have visibility, have understand, baseline what are the parameters in order to accomplish

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,680
that goal.

00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,269
You'll start to see through your action plans a framework begin to develop.

00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:04,399
So here's kind of the feedback loop that I found online.

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,960
Plan, learn, do, assess.

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,449
This is a link from a U.S.

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:16,649
New York education department.

00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,420
There is a repetition to the execution of these individual goals.

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:26,230
We are working to create learning behaviors and transition those behaviors into habit.

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,259
When you start to get to this step in your plan, you will start to regain some of the

00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:35,720
control experiences an rewards of the work being done.

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,509
Your new learning has begun.

00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:44,259
Let's -- so now let's connect each of our goals into a road map, or a PDP.

00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,430
Which is professional development plan.

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:52,240
So I pulled some online and I'm just going to share these with you.

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:58,570
And the reason why is when writing out the plan, there are several examples online.

00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,529
With templates, graphs, et cetera.

00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,199
To be honest, it's somewhat overwhelming.

00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:09,370
So my advice is to keep it simple and work within the tools you are familiar and comfortable

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,370
with.

00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:16,339
The real value in everyone's PDP is in the formation and the experiences in actually

00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,839
executing that plan.

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,740
Think of the creation of your plan as an assessment in learning about yourself.

00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:29,230
The plan is a framework for understanding and addressing some professional development

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:35,860
needs and the pathways for you as an individual to meet those needs.

00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,399
You own this plan.

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,750
Your professional development is not the responsibility of anyone but your own.

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,940
There's three interesting rules that are not rules but guidelines that I want to provide

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,400
here.

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,420
The plan is never final.

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,269
Your PDP is not written in stone.

00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:58,350
It can be and should be revised on a regular basis.

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,709
Goals shift, people change, objectives change.

00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:05,850
Circumstances can present new challenges and opportunities.

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,870
As a growing professional, you must remain nimble.

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,050
I mean, this is one of the DevOps core principles.

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,970
You never -- you're never done professional development.

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,730
It's not like you can graduate from this.

00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:19,370
It's ongoing learning.

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,930
Being a constant life learner means that you're constantly coming back and asking yourself

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,750
what's the new destination for me.

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,400
And when you start, you start today.

00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:38,990
No matter what station in life you're in, making a plan is for each of you.

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:44,889
It is about you and what you want to accomplish, where you want to go, and how you want to

00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:49,589
control the next part of your life.

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:55,370
So there are buckets of development that I want to talk about.

00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,519
Continuing education.

00:14:56,519 --> 00:14:59,570
Advancing your knowledge in core competencies.

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:08,389
Industry standards, technical developments, focusing on advancing your industry knowledge.

00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:10,500
Skills training.

00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,120
These are behavioral skills.

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,910
Leadership training, communication, et cetera.

00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,130
A big one here, EQ development.

00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:25,779
Success in DevOps in my humble opinion depends greatly on our ability to read others in situations

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:27,440
and motivations.

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:35,279
Having empathy, mindfulness, understanding unconscious bias is huge in being able to

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,580
build a layer of trust in order to make things happen.

00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,660
Professional networking.

00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,649
Your professional relationships is your first safety net, should any unplanned event happen

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:47,649
to you.

00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:53,699
Having a strong and current network is vital for information sharing of ideas, advisement,

00:15:53,699 --> 00:15:59,579
and building trust.

00:15:59,579 --> 00:16:03,590
So using your PDP to manage relationships around you.

00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:10,779
Now that you have a plan, you have some goals with actionable states to meet those goals.

00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:13,100
You're really starting to regain some control.

00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,110
But what do I mean by this?

00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,110
Let's take this character.

00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,040
This guy Jerry, he's a recruiter.

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,430
In the past we used to utilize Jerry when we needed a job.

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,950
Some of you call Jerry.

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:34,449
Other times you were just unsolicited by him with a job description in your email.

00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,120
This experience was very transactional.

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,480
Jerry sees you, says you can do this, you say yes, they say do you want to do this for

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
this.

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,190
Yes, yes, yes.

00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:49,850
Literally, you're making a lateral move from a pathological organization to a bureaucratic

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,850
one.

00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:53,490
But it can't be worse than where I left.

00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:00,069
You're literally running away from something into something unknown.

00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:03,839
Have you really advanced yourself in that kind of transactional relationship?

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,310
In my mind, no.

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,760
So let's flip this script.

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:12,439
You actually have a plan, some guidelines, some frameworks as to where you want to be.

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:14,949
You've been balancing your development buckets.

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:19,640
Instead of Jerry reaching out to you unsolicited, you actually have a real relationship with

00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,280
Jerry.

00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,630
You've met on several occasions.

00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:29,670
Jerry has helped in putting a PDP together for you from his perspective, giving you information

00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:36,970
of what's happening out in the landscape that you may be unaware of.

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:44,980
You've now turned Jerry into an active agent for yourself.

00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:50,610
They can actually go out with real context about who you are, what your goals are, where

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:58,430
your desires are, and change the dialogue when he's talking to his clients or internally.

00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:04,630
This is a complete flip of the narrative, from being transaction in your relationships

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:08,390
to suddenly being proactive.

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:16,650
Let's talk about managing up with your boss.

00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,340
So we talked about these guys.

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,640
Take these two characters from earlier.

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:29,090
When you have no direction for yourself, if you're reacting to your boss, there is no

00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,150
directive or influence to the decisions being made upon you.

00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,419
But when you have a plan, a PDP, you know what's important to you.

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,650
There's real motivation for you to insert yourself into conversations or initiatives

00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:43,830
that align with your development plan.

00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:49,400
Furthermore, if you've been equally contributing to your buckets, you have the awareness and

00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:56,580
behavioral tools to build the type of trusted relationship with your manager to be empowered

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,930
and to be a real contributor to decisions being made about you.

00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:07,510
You provide -- you're able to provide a vision and goals that your manager now can take into

00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:12,200
their meetings and talk about what initiatives they want to take on, because their staff

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,810
members are saying this is what we want to do, this is where we want to be.

00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,970
Help us to make this happen for ourselves.

00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,620
We're now starting to make some moves here.

00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:31,330
And as a manager, imagine how different that relationship with your staff is.

00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:37,210
Your dialogue, your interactions, your engagements become very focused.

00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,670
Both sides are super engaged.

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:47,900
As a manager, why should you want all of your staff to have a PDP.

00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:55,330
When you're leading a team, learning how individuals work is vital to understanding the team dynamic.

00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,190
Individual motivations goals, et cetera.

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:02,000
These relationships are built over time through work interactions, one-on-one, et cetera.

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,080
In theory, it's a satisfactory process.

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,330
But in reality, managers don't have the time to prioritize and allocate to every responsibility.

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:19,409
They're having to constantly reprioritize what's important at different times within

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:20,409
their lives.

00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:22,460
Or their professional work lives.

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:29,210
So your one-on-ones end up getting postponed or rescheduled, which sends a message to the

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:32,000
staff members, this isn't an important thing do.

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,120
It becomes a check box rather than an actual growing and learning experience.

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:44,640
But with a PDP, you know what is important to each of your team members.

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,150
You can prioritize projects around that.

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,220
One-on-ones are structured.

00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:52,630
You're showing up with results, not what are we going to talk about.

00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:55,960
What's yesterday's weather like, how are you feeling today.

00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,410
You can manage up with much more confidence on initiatives that you take on, and you know

00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:08,250
that you have a motivated, engaged team behind you that are going to help make you successful

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:16,380
When people know how to ask for help between specific individuals, it's easier to grant

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,380
someone help.

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,370
If you can help somebody but they tell you they're not telling you how you can help them,

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:24,150
it's very hard to take action upon that.

00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:30,100
So that's what a PDP can help for you.

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,990
So taking back control.

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:33,530
Delete FOMO.

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:40,270
When you have your goals and really believe in them, you are truly motivated to reaching

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:41,270
those goals.

00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,450
You have become already booked.

00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,299
And when you're already booked, you can't get FOMO.

00:21:47,299 --> 00:21:52,850
You are not worried about what others are doing or saying.

00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:57,230
You have your path before you, you understand what is really important and why.

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,560
The excitement and confidence begins to build momentum.

00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:06,790
You are empowered, you are educated, you are motivated.

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,870
In closing, remember.

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:11,020
Life is learning.

00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,789
So make it fun and enjoy the journey.

00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:16,029
Thank you so much for your time and attention.

00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:20,570
My name is David Fredricks and I hope this helps you delete your FOMO.

00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:28,240
[ Applause ] I'm going to get a selfie real quick if you guys don't mind.

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,130
>> I tried to photo bomb you.

00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,429
>> Thank you.

00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:40,559
>> Dave, you have a few minutes for questions if you want them.

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,559
DAVE: Sorry.

00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:45,330
I was ready to run off stage here.

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:53,420
Any questions, thoughts, ideas?

00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,350
Let's run the mic.

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:03,840
AUDIENCE: During your presentation you briefly touched upon the term unconscious bias.

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,230
I wanted to see if you could expand on that a little bit more and maybe provide us with

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:14,390
like some solutions that somebody could use if they were to come across such a thing in

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,390
the workplace.

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:21,350
DAVE: That's a great question and boy, we could get into some good discussions on this.

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,110
So, the question was unconscious bias.

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:29,410
I brought that up a little bit within my EQ skills training, right.

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:38,730
And so give an example and then some suggestions on how we mitigate it.

00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:45,360
Unconscious bias basically is being at a station or stage in life where you've kind of grown

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,970
up with blinders on, and in the news we're hearing about a lot of privilege and things

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,580
of that nature.

00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:01,350
But these are biases that have been built upon -- in their minds and reinforced throughout

00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:07,320
our lives and we don't realize it as individuals this is how we see the lens of the world.

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,679
And everyone has it.

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,770
First and foremost.

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,039
That's what I want to state.

00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,110
We just aren't aware that we have it.

00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:21,039
So one of the ways that I found is a great way to start to uncover that sense is to start

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:30,230
to integrate yourself in communities, in relationships, that are not the same as you.

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:37,179
Where you're uncomfortable and being vulnerable and starting to communicate that, is how you

00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,260
start to identify wait, you know what?

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,929
I have been looking at people through this lens without even realizing this is the way

00:24:44,929 --> 00:24:46,880
that I've been painting them.

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,340
And hopefully over time and real relationship building and you start to uncover more.

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,950
And that's the thing about unconscious bias.

00:24:53,950 --> 00:25:00,770
As you start to unwrap the onion of your life, you start to peel back the many, many layers

00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:06,680
which kind of reinforce those, that lens or the way you view it.

00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
Does that help?

00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,820
AUDIENCE: That definitely helps.

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,480
DAVE: It could get very complicated.

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,059
The main goal for me was to basically make sure that people are aware.

00:25:17,059 --> 00:25:21,831
The way you see the world and the lens at which you look is not the only way it can

00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:22,831
be seen.

00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:23,831
It's perspective.

00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:27,590
You're only seeing one side of the beach ball when the beach ball has several colors.

00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:32,380
And if you and I are looking only at red and if we think that red is the only existence,

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:35,820
we are missing all of the other sides of that beach ball.

00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,820
AUDIENCE: That's helpful.

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,820
Thank you.

00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,820
DAVE: Any other questions?

00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,820
Thank you guys!

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,820
[ Applause ] >> Thank you, Dave.

00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,820
I feel empowered.

00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
So that's good.

00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,820
Just so everybody knows, that was the last talk in Wimberly for today.

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,820
Oh, we have waving hands.

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,820
No, it's not true.

00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:46,820
We're going to have the workshop in here.

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,820
So there is a workshop at 3:30.

00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,820
It is automating security.

00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,820
And if you are interested in that, please come here at 3:30.

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,820
And other than that, have a wonderful afternoon.

So if you don't want to come to the workshop on security stuff, there's also Open Spaces,

there's hanging out with our sponsors in the Cyclorama.

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,820
So please do those things and see you at 5:00 p.m. for the wrap-up here, if not sooner.
