So I only have the one slide, because I want to make sure people have my Twitter if they

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,500
want to get in touch and talk more about any of the stuff that Brian talked about or the

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:30,410
stuff I'll talk about after the thing I want to talk about in the next five minutes is

00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:35,750
what would the world look like if developers could stop caring about secrets.

00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,730
How much of your time do you spend worrying about getting secrets to the parts of your

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,270
application that need them?

00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,760
Maybe you need a service that you deployed to connect to another service or API or you

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,850
need it to connect to its data store.

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:54,190
There's lots of different ways that you can handle this.

00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:59,079
Maybe the worst I want to discourage anyone from doing is checking those secrets into

00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:04,750
your git and pushing them out to your apps that way.

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:10,150
Maybe you part of your config or you use a vault and you leverage the tooling that the

00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,860
vault makes available to get the secrets to your apps.

00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:17,680
What about in your own work flows?

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,950
How often do you work at the command line and need to log in to a CLI that requires

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,540
some credentials?

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:30,460
So have you to find a way to store those creds securely but somehow get them to the command

00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,210
line when you need them.

00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,750
That can lead to some practices like putting the secrets that you need in your file system.

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,320
Which isn't ideal.

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,330
While you're developing, how do you manage that evolution from developing in a development

00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,930
environment to development in a production environment.

00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,360
Usually you have different needs in those two environments.

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,730
Sometimes when you do local development, you're just connecting to a local device, but in

00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,200
prod you need other secrets.

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,250
So how do you navigate the transition from one to the other.

00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,090
In our current workflows there's some real down sides.

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,510
We spend a lot of time worrying about how to get secrets to our applications, when that's

00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,610
not really the core thing that we care about.

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,019
What we care is that service A can connect to service B. But we don't get to think about

00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:19,019
it in those terms.

00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,390
We have to think about it like oh, how can I get this secret over there.

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,500
Which means that we learn a lot of special tooling to deal with secrets, even though

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,490
that's not our primary domain expertise.

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:33,379
It's not the thing that is going to really deliver value to our business.

00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,709
It's a side concern.

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:41,840
And even with all the work that we do to learn this additional tooling, we still do a crappy

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,540
job, even if we have the best intentions.

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,910
There's still breaches and hacks that happen, and secrets still leak.

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:52,840
So we're not doing well enough at this.

00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,060
So I started to think what would a nice solution for this problem look like?

00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:02,269
And think about what it's like for the web applications that you interact with.

00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:05,769
How many of you here use a password manager?

00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,650
So it's a well-adopted practice in this group.

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,420
Like my mom doesn't use one yet, I'm trying to get her on it.

00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,250
But we'll get there.

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,350
So the benefit of using a password manager is that you can create really strong secure

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,870
passwords with the click of a button, you can easily rotate them again by clicking a

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:29,000
button and it has browser plugins and apps that you can install on your cell phone that

00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,019
basically auto authenticate so you don't have to think about.

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,280
That's pretty nice so you can visit your favorite websites or applications and you don't have

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,910
to worry about the secrets.

00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:47,010
The secrets are still there, but you don't have to think about it.

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,240
So let's try to apply that to our development workflows.

00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:56,099
We as a community can leverage tools that exist today that do exactly that for us.

00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,409
They make secrets available to apps that need them, or even better that handle the authentication

00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,690
process for them entirely so they don't have to worry about it.

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:11,840
In a way we want to make it so that in our development workflows, the process feels the

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:18,599
same as it does when we visit a web app and we use our password manager integration.

00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:22,590
Even better, we can make these tools publicly available, and open source.

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,190
So that anyone can use them.

00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:30,530
We can make sure that they will work with any CLI or service that you need them to.

00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:35,650
We can make them so that they can easily navigate the differences between the development and

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,350
the tests and the production environment.

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,110
This is a big part of the open source work that we do at Cyber Ark and I would love to

00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,110
talk to you more about it.

00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,440
I only got 5 minutes today.

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,960
Please get in touch with me on Twitter, or come by the booth.

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,860
Cyber Ark has a booth in the main hall and it would be a missed opportunity to say we're

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:58,500
hiring and we'll pay you to work in open source and sustainably.

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,229
Thank you.

00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,089
