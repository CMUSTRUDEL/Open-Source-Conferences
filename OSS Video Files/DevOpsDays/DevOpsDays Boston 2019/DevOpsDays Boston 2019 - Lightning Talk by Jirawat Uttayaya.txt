My talk is five books in five minutes to help build a better DevOps culture.

00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:22,820
Five minutes.

00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:23,820
All right.

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,890
So show of hands, who here has quit their job within the last two years?

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,290
I have.

00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:34,300
Who here want to quit right now?

00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,239
I see some hands.

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,850
These books have helped me try to build a better culture where I work.

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:50,320
So number 5: People wear by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister.

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,170
People want to have social bonding.

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,559
They want to belong to a group, a tribe, a team.

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:04,439
But at the same time, knowledge workers need quiet and an uninterrupted flow to actually

00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,439
get their work done.

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,729
And to just think.

00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,280
So lesson 1, Open Spaces sucks.

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,040
We all hate it, right?

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,070
I guarantee you if you're a recruiter and you put in your profile that no open office

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,770
plans, you will increase your recruiting effort by 15%, guaranteed.

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,850
Now, but you do want a communal space.

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,750
So communal spaces should be voluntary.

00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:39,829
It should be like a lunch table where everyone shares food and socializes and talk or kind

00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:43,670
of like a game area where you can relax with a couch and games.

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,240
It shouldn't be forced into a open area, because you can't do anything like that.

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,159
So number 4 is Drive by Daniel Pink.

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,499
Why do we work 40 hours, 50 hours and 60 hours and try to bring our passionate effort to

00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,499
our jobs.

00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:08,399
Daniel Pink says there's three things.

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,350
One is money.

00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,480
Don't underpay your employees, because you'll know.

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,290
Especially if you're an underrepresented group, don't under pay.

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:25,620
Once you have your food and your rent taken care of, there's still self-actualization.

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,800
So Daniel Pink breaks it into three things.

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
AMP.

00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,450
Autonomy, mastery, purpose.

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,659
Autonomy, don't micromanage.

00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,040
We're pretty smart we'll figure out how to do things.

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,879
We'll come ask if we don't know how to do it.

00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,780
Two, mastery, we want to learn new things.

00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,879
There's a sense of accomplishment in learning new things, and it also keeps everyone in

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,560
a new job, keeps up pace with the current job market.

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,209
And three is purpose.

00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:59,370
So let's say you have a JIRA, what, board, that has three tasks.

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,110
At the end of the week you finish those three tasks, it doesn't mean anything.

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:05,909
You don't get a sense of accomplishment.

00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:12,500
But if you know why you want to do things, then there's a sense of okay, completion and

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,910
I did something important with my time and not just complete three tasks.

00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:25,629
Now, especially with why, there's another book, number 3, start with why by Simon Sinek.

00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:32,159
And he expounds more eloquently about why you have to start with why you're doing something

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,299
and that will inspire your team to do the how and the what.

00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:49,050
Number 2 is seven pillars of servant leadership by James Sipe and Don Frick.

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,780
Being a leader doesn't mean telling people what to do, dictating orders.

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,400
It's about serving your team, serving the people in your company.

00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,270
You want to be their emotional, to serve their emotional needs, to feel safe, to feel valued.

00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:08,840
You want to provide the tools and the resources for your team to do whatever they need to

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,180
do to get their jobs done.

00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,790
You not only want to show the path, but you want to tell why you're doing the path and

00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,780
how you're going to get there.

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,400
And that leads to number 1.

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:30,150
Number 1 is 360 Degree leader by John Maxwell.

00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,099
Being a leader doesn't mean you have a title, you have a position, you have seniority.

00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:39,970
You can be a leader in all 360 degrees of your circle.

00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,720
You can mentor junior developers.

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,340
You can influence your peers, you can guide your leaders and your managers into making

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,340
good decisions.

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:58,510
And if you're a leader, be brave to accept that leadership from whoever it comes from.

00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,940
It doesn't matter what their rank, position, title is.

00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,699
So So in closing, be the change you want to see

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,470
at work, and it's easier said than done.

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:12,600
Changing culture is really hard.

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
And 4:51.

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Under 5.

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:14,601
