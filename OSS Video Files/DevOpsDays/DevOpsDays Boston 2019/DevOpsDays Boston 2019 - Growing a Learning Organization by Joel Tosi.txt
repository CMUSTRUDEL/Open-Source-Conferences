Title: DevOpsDays Boston 2019 - Growing a Learning Organization by Joel Tosi
Publication date: 2019-10-11
Playlist: DevOpsDays Boston 2019
Description: 
	Growing a Learning Organization by Joel Tosi

This session is an evolution of our talks around growing Dojos (though awareness of dojos is not necessary for this talk).

In this session we will look at the challenges facing organizations and people today trying to learn new skills (committment, context, multitude of needs).

From there we will look at how we learn exploring explicit vs tacit knowledge.

We will wrap up with tangible ways you can start growing an organization that continuous learns - looking at addressing the whole value stream to provide context and growing an organization that has internal coaches and teachers (along with models for that).

>> There we go!

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,359
Are we good?

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:19,359
All right.

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,359
That's me, that's the slides.

00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:21,579
I talk fast, have some fun.

00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:25,029
If I move, is that going to throw you off?

00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:26,369
I tend to get weird.

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:27,869
Oh, I can get weird?

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:29,629
All right.

00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,960
That's a picture of me.

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,210
So here's the thing.

00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,780
I used to work at a horrible place in Chicago.

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,870
Anybody worked in the Chicago mercantile exchange?

00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:53,480
I worked at red hat for a few years as an architect.

00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,380
But the biggest thing I've been doing for a while is helping organizations learn.

00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,970
It seems kind of weird but let's talk about how that works.

00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:04,799
This is the frame I want you to think about.

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,060
I'm at DevOps Days, you know all Deming.

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,649
You have to to get in here, right?

00:01:10,649 --> 00:01:13,700
This is what I want you to think about while we're jamming today.

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,770
A lot of places I go, they all want the answer.

00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:23,130
How do we became the new Netflix or how do we became Etsy.

00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,350
Just give us the answer.

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,110
Tell us what to do.

00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,930
There is no shortcut.

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,720
If you just want the answer, if you just want the magic potion, I'm sorry.

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,720
It doesn't exist.

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,700
If you find it, by all means patent it, because you'll make a million dollars.

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,900
But it doesn't exist.

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,680
So you actually have to want to get better.

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,450
And you have to be intentional about it.

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,140
And you have to learn along the way.

00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,939
You have to invest in learning.

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,460
So this is what we'll talk about today how do we go about creating spaces where learning

00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,460
is what happens?

00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,740
For me these are the things that I see in organizations that need to happen to learn.

00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,979
And I'll give you some kind of context here in a little bit about what these all mean.

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,099
You can read them all.

00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:15,800
To learn you have to be able to experiment.

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,590
Implicit in there is to be able to experiment, it has to be safe to experiment.

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,700
Right?

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,599
Everybody says we're a learning organization, just never be wrong!

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,980
That is not going to be a good way to learn.

00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,160
So it has to be safe, it has to be implied that it's okay to try some things out and

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,480
we're going to be wrong.

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,730
I had a dear friend of mine that said, because you know, learning and failing is a popular

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:41,730
thing, right?

00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,280
And a dear friend of mine used to say, the only difference between learning and failure

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,370
was cost.

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,900
When it was cheap, everybody was like oh, we learned it was great.

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,170
But if it was expensive, people were like that was a failure much so we have to make

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,110
things cheap, we have to make it easy to fail and learn.

00:02:58,110 --> 00:02:59,720
It has to be something we're always doing.

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,739
It has to be contextual, it has to be experienced-based.

00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:07,209
So let's get this a little bit more.

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:11,020
Why does learning have to be repetitive?

00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,550
Why do we have do things consistently?

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,099
Anybody know what this is, besides the Wikipedia link down here?

00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:20,099
It's the Forgetting Curve.

00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:21,180
Good job.

00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:31,370
There was this dude back in the late 1800s, Herman Ebinghouse who came up with this theory.

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,550
If you're trying to learn something new, if you don't repeat you, you forget it.

00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,120
That was the 1800s.

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,110
We're smarter now.

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,970
If you learn something here in day zero and if you're not trying and doing it over and

00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,550
over again, by day 6 you tend to forget these things.

00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,030
If you do it again the next day it lasts a little bit longer.

00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,360
If you do it again, it lasts longer.

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,840
You see where this is going?

00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:01,620
This is where I think it makes sense to me is so, look.

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,780
I teach courses and stuff.

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,130
I taught TDD, I teach DevOps courses and I am wonderful at it.

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:15,209
But the point being is that if you hang out with me for a couple of days and you don't

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,989
do it when you go back to work and you don't do it the next day and you're busy because

00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,740
the project is due and then something else happens, it doesn't matter how awesome the

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,389
course was, I guarantee when you try and do it, you won't know how to do it.

00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:30,330
Because you have to do these things over and over again.

00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:33,270
Then you have this kind of fun thing.

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,699
I mentioned the Chicago mercantile change, I have no problem saying they're a horrible

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:44,279
place a second time.

00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:46,320
You got 40 hours a year to learn.

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,699
Therefore we're invested in your learning.

00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,699
But you know how it goes.

00:04:49,699 --> 00:04:53,800
That just means you can't do anything until December 15th and you have to use it by the

00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,389
end of the year, otherwise you lose it.

00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:57,880
You're all smart people.

00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,001
Statistically speaking if you have 40 hours distributed over the course of a year, you're

00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,001
not learning.

00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:07,789
You're just doing what you always do and the learning is an anomaly.

00:05:07,789 --> 00:05:11,889
So if you want to have a culture of learning as a thing that happens, learning can't be

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:13,069
an anomaly.

00:05:13,069 --> 00:05:15,060
It has to be something engrained in what you do.

00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,069
It has to be continuously happening.

00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:23,080
Everybody know this fine gentleman?

00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,449
I don't know him either.

00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,939
[ Laughter ] It would be really weird if you're like that's

00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,789
so-and-so.

00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:34,729
Anybody have an idea what this gentleman is doing?

00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:35,729
He's selling water.

00:05:35,729 --> 00:05:36,729
Yeah.

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:42,210
I mean that's probably what he's really doing, but for my analogy, he's transferring knowledge.

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,729
Because that's what knowledge is, right?

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:45,749
I can just pour it into a cup and say here you go.

00:05:45,749 --> 00:05:47,979
Now you have the good.

00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,249
This is the language we use in organizations.

00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:54,349
We talk about knowledge transfer, knowledge transfer, knowledge transfer.

00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:58,889
The reality is like for us to actually learn things, people can't just pour it into a cup

00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:01,520
and say now you have it.

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,300
We have to create -- knowledge creation is a personal thing.

00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,649
You have to do it yourself for it to happen.

00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:09,999
You can't just drink it and now you have it.

00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:14,550
So again, trying to give you ideas of how these things have to come together for you.

00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,839
And last but not least, one of my favorite ones, any guesses what that fabulous picture

00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,839
is?

00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,129
It's a tattoo.

00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:23,839
And it's even my tattoos.

00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:25,000
Here's the background of this story.

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,900
I was talking to my tattoo artist a few years ago I go how did you get into tattooing?

00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,539
It seems like a fair question.

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,819
I go hopefully you were just like an artist and you said one day I'm really good at drawing,

00:06:39,819 --> 00:06:42,199
give me some body parts and I'm going to figure this stuff out.

00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:44,939
He said no, that would be silly.

00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,460
Don't do that.

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,690
And he went through the whole process of how he had to learn how to too . He had to learn

00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,129
how to draw and practice on our-body parts.

00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:57,469
He had to practice on various fruits and kinds of things.

00:06:57,469 --> 00:06:59,279
He had to observe people.

00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,729
But in essence he had to experience it himself.

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,679
Now I think about that, and to me this is a very creative process, like all the things

00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:07,679
you do.

00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:08,679
It's a creative process.

00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:13,369
He has to understand how various different skins will age and inks will age and how different

00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:15,250
colors will look.

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,219
But I think about the organizations we're in.

00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:21,740
And like we think if we send a couple of people to AWS training, that when they come back

00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,440
they can put it into JIRA -- not JIRA.

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,339
They can put it into Confluence or Share Points because now everybody has it.

00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:34,339
Because somebody went to a class and they put it into Share Point but if you try and

00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,520
do it just go read it.

00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,969
That's not how it works.

00:07:37,969 --> 00:07:42,599
If you go get a tattoo and you asked the artist how did you learn and if they say from share

00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:46,110
point, don't get that tattoo!

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:54,569
From your space a couple of people from the team went to the class now everybody knows.

00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:56,409
It doesn't work that way.

00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,279
You have to experience these things yourselves.

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:07,270
If Share Point and Confluence were like solving the world's problems with knowledge transfers

00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:09,419
everybody would be crushing it.

00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,419
No one is.

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:12,139
I shouldn't say no one, but it's not that common.

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:18,989
What are the things a lot of people are doing that I don't think works so good.

00:08:18,989 --> 00:08:20,620
They copy.

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,749
Because again, we want the shortcut.

00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:23,709
But what does Spotify do?

00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:24,709
They have tribes.

00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:27,879
Let's have tribes then and we'll be smart and productive like them.

00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,081
What does Netflix do?

00:08:29,081 --> 00:08:33,080
They do chaos engineering let's do that and we'll be successful.

00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,979
You can't copy your way to success.

00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:39,229
One of the -- I forget the gentleman's name.

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:48,050
One of the gentlemen from the Toyota days we'll tell you the way Toyota does everything.

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:53,180
If that helps you, good, but you'll never know what learned to get there, and that's

00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,940
what makes us better.

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,431
You can't copy Spotify and copy Netflix and all of a sudden be better, because you're

00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,279
not going to have the context that they had, you're not going to have the learnings they

00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,490
had to get there.

00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:05,300
So we can't copy our way to success.

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,150
This one is even more fun.

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:11,990
Anybody here, if I offend anybody my apologies.

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:18,149
Anybody here want to do maturity models if consultants come in and tell me how mature

00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:21,329
we are on a level of 1-5?

00:09:21,329 --> 00:09:24,209
This kind of stuff happens all the time.

00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:26,220
Here's what I find interesting about this.

00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,139
It's always by somebody at a high level that says come in and grade my teams and tell me

00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:33,399
where the gaps are.

00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:38,930
The fun part is, your teams, the people doing things, already know what the problems are.

00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:42,190
But instead of just talking to the people that are actually doing the work, we want

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,829
some outside group to come in and say give me a score.

00:09:46,829 --> 00:09:51,060
Just talk to your people and make it so that they can learn and they can get better.

00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,000
Enough ranting, I promise.

00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,470
Well, a little more ranting and then we'll talk about how these things kind of work.

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,529
Transformations aren't.

00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,459
This is very cut and dried.

00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:06,459
It should be obvious.

00:10:06,459 --> 00:10:11,740
This idea, who in here is doing a transformation whether it's a DevOps or product or some kind

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,420
of stuff.

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:18,510
If you're not doing a transformation, you've already lost, right?

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,510
Look.

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:24,060
We're well, most of us, remember the Transformers.

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,379
There was Optimus Prime and he was a truck and then he was a robot.

00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:38,070
Your goal in your organization is you're going to transform and you're done, it's kind of

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:39,070
silly.

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:41,620
Your goal shouldn't be to get done.

00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,500
Your goal should be to always get better.

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:51,220
If your idea is transform, you've got a wrong approach on it.

00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:55,160
Embrace learning, always be there, looking how to get better and let's get into how you

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,379
can go about doing it.

00:10:56,379 --> 00:11:01,269
Come back to these main concepts.

00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:06,920
Repetition, experimentation.

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:18,220
I'm an independent consultant.

00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,180
I'm also a horrible salesperson.

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:28,310
You're all certified in whatever I say, go off and be merry.

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:32,189
The stuff that I've been finding successful for a lot of groups is this idea of these

00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:33,189
dojos.

00:11:33,189 --> 00:11:40,810
These came up from a handbook early on talking about examples of organizations doing this

00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,810
stuff.

00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:45,490
I just happened to be at one of those organizations consulting, kind of helping them figure out

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,230
how to create a learning organization.

00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,870
So we do these dojo stuff.

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,379
So you can read it all.

00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,759
But this is what it is.

00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:02,050
You create this space where whole teams come together, mind blown already, and they come

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,470
together to learn new ideas while doing their work.

00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:09,540
It's as simple as that.

00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,790
The whole team, so it's not just the operations people figuring out Chef or Puppet or whatever

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,269
is hip these days.

00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,129
It's not just the designers figuring out how to do wire frames.

00:12:20,129 --> 00:12:25,120
It's not just the scrum masters figuring out scrum or whatever they do there.

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,329
It's not just the engineers learning micro services.

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,370
It's the whole group learning new things together to build their product.

00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:35,730
They learn things, they apply it immediately, they figure out where it works for them, where

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,529
it doesn't work, how it falls apart.

00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:42,290
It kind of fits into this sweet spot.

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,240
So they're there doing real stuff.

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,139
It's not sandbox where nothing goes wrong.

00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:52,870
You still have to deal with security and policies and everything else that's going to go wrong

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,509
in your real world.

00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:59,689
They're doing that while learning new things, guided by people.

00:12:59,689 --> 00:13:02,019
But they're continuously building upon it.

00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:04,490
And early on it's slow and it's painful.

00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:08,069
But then teams start to get this flow where they're learning new things and they figure

00:13:08,069 --> 00:13:14,480
out how the new things fit into their daily work and they figure out how to work together

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
better.

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,329
And the things that they're investing in, these new skills are there and they continuously

00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:20,649
build upon them.

00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:25,519
So it's this kind of nice contextual value for them.

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,610
It's experienced-based.

00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,499
People aren't doing it for them.

00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:32,470
So it's just a nice space to get into.

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,040
This is just to give you an idea, it will make more sense in the next slide.

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:46,080
A lot of places, this is -- take aside DevOps and all these other kinds of things, you're

00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:50,420
all here together to make sure this kind of stuff happens.

00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,529
Right?

00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:53,300
People are happy.

00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,649
Some point in time someone identifies people are unhappy and we've got to do things along

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:00,209
the way to make people's lives better.

00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,209
And there's a flow of how those problems get involved.

00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:07,370
That's all I'm trying to show you in this slide.

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:13,180
Now, if you think about these four kind of groupings, there is various skills that might

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:21,189
happen along the way, but like the idea that your only problem is over here is usually

00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:23,170
not true.

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,190
I built products for years.

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,350
This is not picking on anybody.

00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,639
I'm not here to offend anybody.

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,899
Usually what happens, somebody has an idea, it's not really a good idea and not been vetted

00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:41,620
but I've got an idea and a budget let's figure out how to bill it, let's build it and once

00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,559
it's in production and it's not doing things we want it to do, let's keep cramming things

00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:50,870
this way and call it technical debt over here because the ideas weren't good and the ideas

00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,990
weren't vetted.

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,920
This is why we need everybody together is that all of these things impact each other.

00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,170
And so when I lay that out, I think about these kinds of things.

00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:07,819
So this is the same slide, just kind of not as pretty.

00:15:07,819 --> 00:15:13,850
A ton of groups wants to do monitoring.

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,240
Let's do monitoring.

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,800
Everybody does is the process up.

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,980
Yeah, I guess that's cool.

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,500
You need systems to be up.

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,370
But you could do so much more.

00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:26,529
Like, you could actually -- if you're building micro services and you were trying to build

00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,149
out a new product, you could figure out how it's going to help people and you could actually

00:15:30,149 --> 00:15:34,040
do domain-driven design instead of talking about it, and you could actually come up with

00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,010
good context around your services and you can do it in a test-driven manner and have

00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:43,999
simple, small things and the monitoring could actually help you figure out if your services

00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:46,649
are being used the way they think they're going to be used.

00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:53,009
It's way cooler figuring out if the CPU is used 100% or not.

00:15:53,009 --> 00:15:58,589
This is how you get people together, and you ground them together on this kind of outcome.

00:15:58,589 --> 00:16:03,959
This is the thing we want to do, how do we learn together to do it.

00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,509
And this stuff doesn't stop.

00:16:05,509 --> 00:16:11,230
Like, you've got to learn how to do it for a while, but the idea of learning when your

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,800
product is done never ends.

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,779
So you've got to learn some skills along the way.

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:17,629
But all these things tie together.

00:16:17,629 --> 00:16:21,529
And if you start doing them well as a group, everything becomes easier.

00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,490
And now it's not about how do we cram more features through because JIRA said we have

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,970
to cram more features through otherwise the velocity is too low, it's about what are we

00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,670
learning along the way and how does it feedback into other aspects of things.

00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,910
And that's more cool.

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:40,550
And then people get jazzed and excited.

00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:45,970
So like what are some things that these groups do in these dojos?

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,069
This is just two totally different examples for you.

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:54,019
One is a team doing brand new prog development, one is a team doing cloud migration stuff.

00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:58,269
You probably can't read any of those words because I can't and I'm that close.

00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,939
But I want you to think about up here, this is over the course of six weeks, teams are

00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:07,070
learning lots of things and they're continuously building upon it.

00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:10,351
They're not just learning how do I build a service and how do I deploy it.

00:17:10,351 --> 00:17:14,980
They're learning how do I figure out what the problem is, how do I do a little bit of

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,430
API design, how do I build a pipeline, how do I monitoring and context and how do I do

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,079
it over and over again.

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,430
Teams get this very small focus on learning a little thing at a time and continuously

00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:33,070
building upon it doing it over and over again, expanding upon it, solving bigger problems.

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,460
And it's just been a very rich environment for these types of groups.

00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,210
That's from the team perspective.

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,410
So teams are learning things, and that's good.

00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,520
There's people there to help teams.

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,100
But what's nice is once you start to get this environment going, and teams are learning

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,270
things, I like to have density of teams.

00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:58,059
I like to have, like if I'm in a space, I'm not going to work with one team and work over

00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,309
there and work over there.

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:01,710
I want the teams coming together.

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,100
And then what starts happening is, teams start helping each other.

00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,440
Because like a team -- a lot of your teams are going to have similar challenges.

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,080
So if you've had a team that's already got past the first hurdle and they see the next

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,390
team coming in to hit it, they can start helping that team.

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:19,960
And now they're teaching while they're helping our teams.

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,450
Now you have this organic learning happening inside your organization.

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,279
And that's a beautiful thing.

00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,020
So now all of a sudden it's not like how do we create communities of practice.

00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:33,280
It's just that people naturally start to orient together around some of their problems.

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:42,560
When I was at the mercantile exchange in Chicago, again a horrible place, we had a center of

00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,560
excellence.

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,580
Because you have to have a center of excellence.

00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,919
And we were -- I was in it as an architect and it was me and a couple of architects just

00:18:52,919 --> 00:19:01,120
hypothesizing about what everybody else should do.

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,970
And so we just came up with for everybody to excellent, we should all do these things.

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,120
But no one would do them because we weren't helping each other.

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,020
It was just coming down from decree.

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,870
When we started creating these environments and teams were helping each other, it just

00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:17,240
became the way that they worked.

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,020
They were always helping each other.

00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
Learning became this given.

00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,730
It was the thing everybody was talking about, how do we help each other.

00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,059
It was a nice rich environment.

00:19:25,059 --> 00:19:29,429
Prior to a bunch of organizations starting these things, they weren't very nice to each

00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:30,620
other.

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,590
So this was actually like a significant change for a lot of groups.

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:41,470
And then this whole idea that -- is my mouse still over there?

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:43,620
I can't find it.

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,020
When teams start learning things, the organization starts learning things.

00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:55,779
And so just as I'm sure you've all experienced, a lot of challenges that teams have aren't

00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,970
the team's problem.

00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,630
And so like in one organization I was working with these engineers and I'm working with

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:09,960
a front-end engineer and we're doing some angular testing together.

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,919
And the middle engineer comes up says the service is ready to be tested and he's looking

00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:17,460
at me.

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,000
I go that's cool.

00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
He's sitting right here.

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,990
Why don't you talk to this dude and why don't you work on it together.

00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,390
In this organization, those two people, the front-end evening year and the middle ware

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:33,659
engineer worked on the same project were not allowed to see each other's code base.

00:20:33,659 --> 00:20:40,570
I was talking to security you realize the one dude could go like this and your whole

00:20:40,570 --> 00:20:42,649
security policy is out the window, right?

00:20:42,649 --> 00:20:46,399
But they would never do that because it's a violation of blah blah blah.

00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:49,020
It's like no, dude.

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,539
This is not a real problem.

00:20:50,539 --> 00:20:52,010
This is something you created.

00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,010
Right?

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:59,400
If you think that's funny, they gave me a policy number and I had never heard of it

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
before.

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,809
And it turned out, I started looking it up and the only way I could find this policy

00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:08,929
ever referred to as a best security practice was in their job postings for the company.

00:21:08,929 --> 00:21:13,840
It turned out the company created it but the security guy didn't know that they created

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,790
it so he didn't know he could change it.

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,430
That was funny.

00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:22,460
So again what's going to happen as teams started learning things, all of the organizational

00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,010
stuff is going to blow up.

00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:28,130
When you slow down to learn things, all the other constraints are going to get magnified.

00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,559
Like when we tell teams to slow down and kind of figure out what's happening, you start

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,470
to hit these things where people are like but we just have to do it faster.

00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:38,799
Okay.

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,480
What happens if we do it faster?

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,550
Everybody tells you there's a deadline.

00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:49,900
It's fun to say, so if a deadline is October 1st, ask somebody what's the cost on October

00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,309
2nd.

00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:53,490
If they don't know the cost, this is where it gets fun.

00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,570
If they don't know the cost of October 2nd, say give me an order of magnitude.

00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,780
Is it $1, $1,000 or a million dollars.

00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:04,350
If they don't know the order of magnitude on the cost of the next day, their dates are

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,360
not real.

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,640
That's where it gets fun.

00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,330
Once you slow down to help teams learn and focus on doing things well and getting context,

00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:18,289
all the organizational things start to blow up.

00:22:18,289 --> 00:22:24,519
All those, if there is's bad ideas this is delta next restarting valid assumptions.

00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:29,820
A lot of organizations have these biases that says if we do things faster we're going to

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,179
be successful.

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:35,730
It turns out the problem isn't speed.

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,860
We can do things faster.

00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:40,520
It turns out a lot of times we don't know what we're doing.

00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,710
So you're going to reveal these biases and again this isn't a team problem.

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,840
But if you slow down to learn, you can ask better questions.

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,970
And all of a sudden this becomes this feedback into doing better things across an organization.

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,890
Last couple of things for you to think about.

00:22:56,890 --> 00:22:59,000
So hopefully your jazzed about the idea of learning.

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,929
You at least get the idea of how the dojo works and the benefits of it.

00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:12,460
I'll tell you this, if you're trying to teach a group to learn, it's different than trying

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,650
to teach a team a process.

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:18,480
And so we're all friends here.

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,190
A lot of places -- so again, I'm not here to offend anybody.

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:24,100
Feel free to throw anything at me that you want.

00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:29,350
But a lot of places I go they have scrum masters or coaches or those kinds of things and a

00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:33,049
lot of times what happens is those people aren't there for learning.

00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,120
They're this for the process.

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,070
Why didn't you put that in JIRA?

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,090
There's no points on that.

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:40,070
There has to be points.

00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,340
This thing is too big.

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,230
Why aren't things carrying over.

00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,760
Realize when you're trying to coach for learning, it's drastically different than coaching for

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,760
a process.

00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:56,370
You have to help teams -- you have to help teams think through what's happening inside

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,430
their head, versus just kind of telling them to not question authority.

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:13,200
The things I think about in this space, if you're trying to help teams learn, it can't

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,100
be philosophical.

00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,529
When I'm working with teams, I'm working with teams.

00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,409
We're sitting down as a group and learning things together.

00:24:22,409 --> 00:24:26,360
It's not philosophical like it's hard to write that test because the code is bad why don't

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,190
you go refactor it and I'm going to walk away for a couple of hours.

00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,929
No we've got to do things together.

00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:36,350
It's not philosophical, there's no meta-thinking here.

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,350
It's doing.

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,130
You have to be able do.

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,070
And if you're trying to coach for learning, it's not about giving the answer.

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,799
It's about helping people answer the questions.

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,730
The thing I tell a lot of groups is make it safe for the group.

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:53,200
Obviously it's a kind of fail.

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,980
But know the cost of their failure.

00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,700
Like if a team is trying to learn something and you don't think it's the right answer,

00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:07,450
if it's risky for them, either politically or financially or something else to go down

00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,590
that road, don't let them go down that road.

00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,390
But if it's not, let them go.

00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,880
There's been plenty of times where I've been wrong, I was like oh, they shouldn't do that.

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,330
And sure enough they did it, and it was a better idea.

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:20,570
That's cool.

00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:25,330
There's been plenty of times where I was actually right, because it's good to be right occasionally.

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:29,250
But if I just give you the answer and you don't experience it, it doesn't matter.

00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,570
Like you don't know why it's that way.

00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,590
Right?

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:39,980
So just realize if you want to create the space of learning, you need to recognize where

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,230
a group is at, create learning opportunities for them that are safe.

00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,260
Make it safe for learning.

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,131
Be that kind of guardrail for them so they don't blow up but allow them to figure it

00:25:51,131 --> 00:25:53,130
out on their own.

00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,390
I can't see what's going on with my slides.

00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:59,200
You want to start your learning journey starting up your space.

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,789
The easiest thing to do, this is what I tell every group.

00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:06,450
Regardless if you're doing this dojo stuff or not.

00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:10,001
If you're trying to create a learning space, you can't just say we're going to learn to

00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:11,320
learn.

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:17,720
You have to put some kind of structure around your learning.

00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,240
Why are we going to learn these things?

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
What's it going to help us do?

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,480
It might sound silly, but the reason why you have to talk about where you're going to focus

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,020
and what the impact it's going to have, is because if you try and focus on learning,

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,830
at some point in time, somebody above your pay grade is going to say prove to me that

00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,710
learning was a good idea.

00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:42,130
Sounds ridiculous, it's happened everywhere I've gone for the past seven years.

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:46,430
When we don't talk about why we're focusing what we're focusing on, when somebody asks

00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:48,640
that questions, we give answers.

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,059
Well, it's a good investment because we talked to five teams.

00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:02,559
But if you come in and say look, a lot of our teams are struggling because their builds

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,049
are failing in production so we want to slow down so we can stabilize in testing and invest

00:27:07,049 --> 00:27:11,210
in testing and better pipe lines and when they come back to me say prove to me those

00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,800
things were a good idea.

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,950
The teams we've helped aren't having this kind of failure demand.

00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:21,870
They're spending more time building good ideas.

00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,070
But if you don't think about where you're going to focus, you're going to have bad answers.

00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,160
Last but not least, think about this kind of space.

00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:35,980
If you know what you want to focus on, just realize that the whole theory of constraints.

00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,760
If you want to get better, if you want to get better products out the door, you're not

00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,309
going to get it if the constraint is the idea being vetted, spending time learning more

00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:50,169
operational stuff isn't going to make it better.

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,690
If the problem is your environments are always unstable, maybe you shouldn't worry about

00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:57,830
more pipelines, maybe you should have some tests.

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,309
Everybody wants a pipeline but nobody wants a test.

00:28:01,309 --> 00:28:03,669
Just build it.

00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:04,740
But use this idea.

00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,929
Once you have an idea of the focus you want to have and the impact you want to have, to

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:13,880
figure out what skills will have that impact for you.

00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,440
Teach those skills, guide those teams, figure out if it's helping.

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,759
And you'll learn in the context of something that's going to help your organization.

00:28:24,759 --> 00:28:27,120
Don't skimp on the coaching.

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,090
My only takeaway for this is if you're going to learn, you need somebody to help the teams

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,100
learn.

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,130
Fair enough?

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,730
I'll tell you this.

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,529
Your best architect and your best engineer might not be the best person to teach.

00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:49,049
Just based upon pure experience, a lot of engineers, present company excluded, they

00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:51,620
want to give the answer.

00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:55,970
They're not sure about how to guide the experience.

00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,320
And so that's what I want you to think about.

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:01,480
If you want people help your teams learn, just make sure that you pick people that have

00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,190
those kind of nurturing skills.

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,340
It's not just the answer or on I'm going to be upset with you.

00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,039
It's like let's walk through this.

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,039
Let's pause.

00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:14,570
They have to be comfortable being uncomfortable in walking teams through these things.

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:21,549
I think I'm good on time, right?

00:29:21,549 --> 00:29:22,549
Look.

00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:30,200
Even if the rest of my stuff was nonsense, my ask of you all is just this, in your organizations,

00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,200
embrace learning.

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,400
Make it just the kind of things you do.

00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,649
Think about the language you use.

00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:41,110
Like when I'm working with teams, we'll talk about the ideas we're trying to do.

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,110
I have teams that we talk about outcomes.

00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,750
Outcomes outcomes outcomes.

00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,530
Then we'll talk about while we're getting to these outcomes, what are the things we

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:51,659
want to learn along the way.

00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,929
Again, feel free to throw stuff at me.

00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:59,299
But we'll do stand-ups kind of in the morning and we'll talk about things.

00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:02,490
But the worst thing you can do is say what did you do yesterday?

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:03,540
What are you going to do today?

00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,049
What's going to get in your way.

00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:09,170
Yesterday I had too many meetings and more meeting today.

00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:11,040
It's not interesting.

00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,649
Change your language and so like when we do use these stamps of these groups, as a group

00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,920
we talk about where are we trying to get?

00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,659
What did we learn getting there yesterday and based upon what we've discovered, what

00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:24,659
has changed?

00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:28,820
And it's not about you being fast and you being slow, it's about us and the realization

00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,250
that we're going to learn things as we build things.

00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,390
And so we have to embrace that idea of learning.

00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,740
Use that language, even if you're not learning new skills, you're always learning something.

00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:41,211
It turns out when he wrote the code and deployed it, it didn't work the way I thought it did.

00:30:41,211 --> 00:30:46,110
It turned out MongoDB went crazy.

00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,500
Use the language to embrace your learning.

00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:54,470
Always experiment, always evolve.

00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,980
You're not going to transform.

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:00,450
Like you're not going to be a robot tomorrow.

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,679
Use these things to figure out ways you can learn and continuously evolve.

00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:12,850
The last thing to think about, again, feels right because it's the DevOps stuff.

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:18,549
You all have wonderful organizations and you're all brilliant people.

00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:21,520
Just allow your people to do the things they need to do.

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,120
You don't need to hire outside people with maturity models to tell you you should have

00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,169
a pipeline or you might want to vet some ideas.

00:31:29,169 --> 00:31:31,309
You all know this stuff.

00:31:31,309 --> 00:31:35,550
Slow down and talk about it and make learning part of what you do.

00:31:35,550 --> 00:31:40,450
There's this nice thing that somebody put on Twitter back in January or February about

00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,840
like January and February everybody wants to hire the rock stars because we're going

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,070
to hire the best.

00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,429
It turns out everybody is trying to hire the best.

00:31:48,429 --> 00:31:51,110
Why don't you just make your people better?

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,250
As opposed to always trying to hire the best.

00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:58,279
That's way easier than trying to compete with everybody in the world for two people.

00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:00,210
So invest in your people.

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,330
Take learning to the next step.

00:32:02,330 --> 00:32:03,420
Make it what you do.

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,740
There's some stuff up there if you're bored or interested.

00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:14,020
I did this talk with my partner a few years back with IT Revolution talking about how

00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,250
these things work.

00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,929
So if you want to check that out, it was pretty fun.

00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:21,159
I actually wrote a book.

00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:23,480
This is not even -- this is more or less for my mom.

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,440
I wrote a book so my mom could say "my son wrote a book" so I expect none of you to buy

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,799
it.

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,659
[ Laughter ] A lot of things around making learning organizations

00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:35,350
is covered in the book and the stuff I've mentioned here.

00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:37,770
There you go.

00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,090
What questions do you all have?

00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:43,059
AUDIENCE: You mentioned several times making it safe for people to fail for learning.

00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,059
Can you speak a little bit more about how you might do that?

00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:45,059
I know that idea sounds really great but when failure actually comes, people don't feel

00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:46,059
the same about it.

00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:47,059
>> Joel Tosi: It's a good question.

00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:48,059
There's always going to be different ways to do things.

00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:55,009
When we're doing things, there's a couple of structural things that I always do for

00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:56,009
groups.

00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:59,039
The first thing is before a team is coming in to learn with me, I'm sitting down with

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,210
their management going through expectations, I'm super explicit.

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:08,920
I say the first two or three weeks, expect 50% of your normal capacity to be delivered.

00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,279
You've got to give space if you can't give space, kind of back off.

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,470
And then continue conversations with management, blah blah blah.

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:18,450
Fun stuff.

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:24,710
Inside when we're learning together, we'll do like super short kind of focused, you can

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,940
call them sprints.

00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,590
We do stuff in two days.

00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:29,610
It's not two days because two days is cooler.

00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:35,850
It's because teams will get wrapped up in all the things they could do, and instead

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:40,410
they get wrapped up and they want to debate everything because they don't want to be wrong.

00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:46,100
So instead it's just let's try something for a day or two and come back and revisit it.

00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,779
These short focus things help a lot.

00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,890
And another thing I've had to do, it's easy for me to do because I'm the outside guy.

00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:58,049
I've been in places, I had this one group, this VP of engineering.

00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:03,820
They had been with me for a week and a half.

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,860
The VP comes in and the team is showing what they built and the VP goes why isn't this

00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,610
done yet and I go it's nice to meet you too.

00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:14,370
And he starts railing into the team.

00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,500
This should be done by now.

00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,550
Blah blah blah.

00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:19,400
And you can see the team, oh, man.

00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:22,850
The team learned a lot of things, they fixed a lot of systemic problems.

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,200
I don't care about that.

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,660
He goes I could have finished it in two days.

00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:33,170
I go, and you see the team is like oh, man.

00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,510
I go, that's awesome, dude.

00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,220
Come down tomorrow and let's knock it out, me and you.

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,820
And he goes what do you mean?

00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,830
We all heard you say it would take two days.

00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,560
You're wasting everybody's time and money.

00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,090
Come down and let's do it.

00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:51,800
And so of course then he backed off that's not what I meant.

00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,520
All I'm trying to tell you with that story is at some point in time you've got to stand

00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:58,410
up to those kinds of things where it is just nonsense.

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,570
There is no easy answer.

00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:03,940
The short things for teams to focus tends to help a little bit, setting expectations

00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:07,520
early on helps a little bit, but when people are assholes you've got to say stop being

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,490
an asshole.

00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:26,210
[ Applause ] Any more questions?

00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:32,380
AUDIENCE: You worked at that place that you hate a lot.

00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:38,950
You had 40 hours a year, so I assume they gave you a week to learn some stuff.

00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,210
Say you want to do like one day, and it's probably not feasible.

00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:48,090
Every week you had one day to just learn something.

00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:50,100
Or maybe it's just that 40-hour week.

00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:53,580
What do you do at the end of that to make sure that whoever is supposed to be learning

00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:59,020
isn't on Facebook or Twitter or whatever and doing nothing of value to the company?

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,730
Without making them feel like an idiot because maybe they just spun their wheels the whole

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:05,040
time, but pitch it to management.

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,091
How do you say they've been working on learning some stuff, here's something concrete that

00:36:09,091 --> 00:36:13,240
you can do with it that's actually valuable.

00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,020
>> If I hear your question correctly.

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:19,960
If people get some time to learn, how do we prove they're not looking at cat videos?

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,200
[ Laughter ] It's a totally fair question, dude.

00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,870
In my experience that's always the question that gets asked, and the more common pattern

00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,770
isn't that people are watching YouTube videos, it's that they're going to be doing their

00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,640
other work or doing kind of maintenance stuff instead of learning stuff.

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,670
So that's the harder part is how do you actually get them to release it and actually do things.

00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,690
I've never -- I guess my point is I don't have a good answer to say they're not looking

00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,760
at YouTube.

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,010
But usually they're not learning because something else is happening.

00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:59,660
And we have to talk about what's happening systemically that's not allowing them to learn.

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:10,060
I don't know, man.

00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:17,390
AUDIENCE: The premise here is that people are self-motivated to learn.

00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:22,680
I'm finding that there are certain people that are very happy and feel better about

00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,980
just doing what we've always done, no matter if we give them better tools, better ways

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:34,380
of doing things, don't do that, just it's broken, it's fine we'll deal with it in the

00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,380
morning.

00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,370
This is a dilemma that I'm struggling with.

00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:42,410
Are there people out there that just are not interested in learning no matter what kind

00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:45,210
of environment or time or incentive you give them?

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,810
>> Joel Tosi: You all heard that.

00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:52,030
She's got a microphone.

00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,110
I totally agree with you.

00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:58,330
I think there's usually people that are comfortable not learning.

00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:02,060
When I've worked with groups, if there's people like that, look I personally don't push on

00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,060
it.

00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:07,590
Usually what's happening though, it's usually a couple of people inside of a team.

00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:12,930
And so then what's happening is there's always a reason behind that.

00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:19,250
At this horrible place that I worked at in Chicago, there was this gentleman that never

00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,000
wanted to work with anybody.

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,760
Never wanted to talk to anybody, didn't want to learn anything.

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,540
Just kind of leave him alone and he'll write code all day.

00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,490
It turned out he was a spy for China.

00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:33,690
[ Laughter ] That's beside the point.

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:35,910
Which was pretty wild.

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,600
But like the only thing we can do is show the team getting better, that if they don't

00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,980
want to be part of the team, I don't know.

00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,140
It sounds harsh, but it's usually better to kind of cut the people that don't want to

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,930
be part, as opposed to like, supporting it.

00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,610
I don't know.

00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:01,930
The cool thing for me when working with these teams, I'm a very -- I won't push the person

00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,260
to learn, but I will sit next to you for a while.

00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:08,090
And I'll be like hey, I know you want to learn some things, let's sit down and do some stuff

00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:09,090
together.

00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:13,190
After a while if they're not into it, I'm not going to force the situation.

00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,140
There's ohm so much you can do.

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,490
One more?

00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,550
AUDIENCE: So coming from the opposite angle.

00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:28,040
Say you're super motivated, you love learning, you want to go to trainings, you want coaches.

00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:34,170
How do you convince your managers or the people that are looking at the bottom line that it's

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,460
worth the investment for them to give you these opportunities?

00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,150
>> Joel Tosi: Investment in learning in general?

00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:45,830
AUDIENCE: Trainings, it cost money.

00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:51,700
How do you convince them on return on investment.

00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:58,720
>> JOEL: If I'm going to talk about learning, it's never learning for learning's sake.

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,260
Ultimately if we want to learn something, if it's in the context it's going to help

00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:08,800
us do things for the company.

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,610
We'll talk about business impact.

00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:15,520
If we can tie back learning into a business impact, then everything becomes like yeah,

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,120
I want to do that.

00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:22,570
The whole idea around continuous integration and continuous delivery to me is faster products.

00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:29,940
If people are saying we're slow to the market, let's learn how to make it so we can experiment

00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,090
better in these markets.

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:34,220
It's not so much about the learning aspect, it's about if we got better at these things,

00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,800
could we do that.

00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,830
On the flip side of that what I'll talk with groups about, a lot of organizations are spending

00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,420
a ridiculous amount of money on learning and getting no return on their investment.

00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,650
Because usually what happens, and maybe you're all different.

00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:51,800
In a lot of places what happens is they'll send a lot of people out, never a team.

00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:55,920
It's always two from you and two from there and over the course of a year, everybody gets

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,240
to go.

00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,010
So they're already spending a lot of money, but they don't realize they're not getting

00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:01,780
a return on that.

00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,920
I'll say let's do one team and have them learn something together while they're actually

00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,800
building their product and let's compare those two models together.

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,250
That's been more effective too.

00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:20,320
