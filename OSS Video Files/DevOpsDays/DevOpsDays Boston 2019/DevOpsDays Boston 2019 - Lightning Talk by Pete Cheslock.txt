>> I have a smoker, I smoke meats and fish and veggies.

00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:31,169
It's a fun hobby that produces delicious foods.

00:00:31,169 --> 00:00:35,080
There's a common trope that floats around LinkedIn.

00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:42,309
It's a positive story about giving everyone a chance wrapped in a humble brag for the

00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,309
poster.

00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:45,739
It goes something like this if you haven't seen this one yet.

00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:47,190
Candidate was late.

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,789
HR said cancel the interview.

00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,760
I said no, I'm giving them a chance and you insert a wholesome reason the candidate was

00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,420
actually late.

00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,630
The course the candidate turns out to be the company's top performer.

00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,750
Look how great I am for seeing this in this person.

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,450
This actually isn't last week, this actually as way a few months ago and I did not update

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,910
the slide.

00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,230
Me and a few friends of mine who might be in this room but I'm not going to tell you

00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:21,280
where they are, were in slack which is of course where all good decisions start.

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,100
The main point here is someone had an idea, someone helped edit it, and we made it double

00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:29,830
spaced because that's how you have to post it on LinkedIn.

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:31,200
This is the slide.

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,680
It says: I had a candidate come in 10 minutes late.

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,570
HR said cancel the interview.

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,700
I said no, she came in and I gave her a chance.

00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:44,689
It turns out she was helping a friend smoke meat, her friend's smoker broke down she stepped

00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:45,689
up.

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:54,899
She came in 10 minutes late reeking of smoke meat.

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:56,700
Who was her friend by the way?

00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,700
Maybe.

00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,060
[ Laughter ] So you know they say don't read the comments?

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,900
We're going to dive into some of these comments.

00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:03,900
They're great.

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,610
A lot of the initial comments were from my small social circle a lot of them were great

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,759
dad jokes here.

00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:18,140
I like this one that mentioned hire the friend who smokes meat during business hours and

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:24,730
if you bring me a smoked brisket to your interview your chances of getting hired will go up dramatically.

00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,890
Dad jokes after dad jokes.

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,890
One after the next.

00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,400
I want to make a T-shirt of this one.

00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,329
This is just great.

00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:35,980
[ Laughter ] At this point now this has become the most

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,680
popular thing I've ever posted on LinkedIn, which is not that hard to do.

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,580
I don't have a sound cloud.

00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,430
I felt I had to come in, yo, by the way this blew up.

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,280
The next day the comments get more and more confused.

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,320
Who smokes meat immediately before an interview.

00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,320
And what's the lesson here?

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,810
Should I smoke meat?

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,430
Yes, Chris.

00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,120
So now we're on to smoking meat and vaping and tanning and this didn't make sense to

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,490
me at all.

00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:15,760
And this one was is great if you had see was helping the impoverished or sickly, but smoking

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,099
meat, first-world problems.

00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,400
Don't you see the point of the post?

00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,590
I'm the better person that saw the talent others would have missed.

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,610
Who the smokes their own meat.

00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,170
What position was she interviewed for?

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,650
Does it matter?

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,630
And then just nonsense.

00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,989
My friend loves smoking beef.

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:38,709
After two days people are getting on to me.

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,370
I think this is satire everyone.

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,950
I saw a similar post.

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,590
I tend to agree.

00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,210
By Friday the comments are just getting crazier.

00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,590
We're about 350,000 views.

00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,110
They're just fighting using hashtags.

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,629
My followers get it, Matthew.

00:03:54,629 --> 00:03:58,019
An now it's just got past silly and becomes art.

00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,989
Your hiring practices discriminate against vegans, vegetarians and meat lovers.

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:07,020
My favorite someone is going to come in and meet your ass and they're going to quit and

00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:11,390
say they don't need my money.

00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:15,629
I thought it would be funny at this point to have the protagonist of this story come

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:16,859
in their own version.

00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,590
Leah, are you here?

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:23,099
Leah helps me out.

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:29,690
Leah posts her side of the story, where her friend's smoker broke down.

00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,140
Like we're making this a real thing.

00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:37,400
So then of course I share her post, that nonsense from my original post because it's all social

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
media, you've got to share it together.

00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,779
And needless to say, yes, this is the weirdest leadership story you've ever heard.

00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:44,779
So what was the outcome?

00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,640
You've got to monitor everything, that's a DevOps thing.

00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:55,450
First it left LinkedIn and landed on an Instagram meme site called LinkedIn flex.

00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,839
There was a slight increase to the views of my LinkedIn profile.

00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:04,580
I don't think 71,000% is a thing.

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,710
There was a massive increase of the number that landed on the chaos search LinkedIn page.

00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,360
But most importantly here, people actually clicked on, and went to my blog post.

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,340
The one that I commented on at the very beginning of this thread.

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,840
At the end of the day I'm just happy that someone read my blog.

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,570
We are still going and it has 1.2 million views.

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:27,289
There are hundreds of comments.

00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,470
I created a bit.ly so you can check them out yourself.

00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,470
Thank you very much.

00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:31,471
