Description: 
	Imposter Syndrome Ain't Just a River in Egypt by Jesse Butler

Nearly twenty years ago, through a combination of luck, hard work and a good amount of self-salesmanship, I broke into the software industry with no formal training or experience. I wrote device drivers and other kernel software, I built and led teams, and I delivered highly visible features as part of the best UNIX operating system on the market. And for most of that time, I thought of myself as a fake.

As a self-taught engineer working in teams of elite, well-educated peers, it took me many years to realize that Iâ€™m actually very good at the job, and the near-constant self-doubt and fear of failure was something known as imposter syndrome. Over time, I began to realize the toll that it took on my life, feeling like I needed to put more hours in and be more on top of breaking trends than all of my peers. In this quick session, I hope to share my experience and observations, as well the strategies I now employ to keep the stress at bay.

Hi, everyone. Thanks so much to the conference for having me. This is my fifth or sixth DevOpsDays

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:33,510
in a year. I took an advocate position. We to lots of traveling . this was if I first

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:42,379
DevOpsDays as an last year. I was like drinking from a fire host, tons of experience with

00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:51,179
the technology, but not the community. It was overwhelming. I'm thrilled to be on stage

00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:58,720
a year later. Thanks so much for having me. So, from time to time in our professional

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:05,100
lives, we get thrown into the deep end, right. This is a space where we actually can thrive.

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:11,430
We can learn new things and we can sort of take the opportunity, thrown into the deep

00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,970
end, we come up swimming, we master it, throw a new tool in our tool bag and we move on

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,860
to the next challenge. And sometimes we're really out of our depth. Sometimes getting

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,900
thrown into the deep end, we don't master it. We don't feel like we're doing well at

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:34,140
all. And sometimes this can bring up a lot of anxiety and feelings of an adequacy even

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:40,830
when we succeed. So, the idea of being thrown out of your comfort zone and into a new set

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,930
of challenges that you succeed with, but you feel like you maybe lucked out. Or maybe you

00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:53,610
just accidently succeeded, that's got a name. That's called imposter syndrome. So, I'm going

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:59,490
to talk a little bit about that. My name is Jesse. I am a cloud native advocate at OCI,

00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:06,350
the Oracle cloud. As I needed more challenges in my life. It's a challenging brand. But

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:13,500
we're doing okay. Containers, Kubernetes, open source things. And talk to me about all

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:20,790
the things including social anxiety and imposter syndrome. When I was a kid, I tinkered a lot.

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,831
I took things apart and put them back together. Sometimes with varying results. Sometimes

00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:35,090
with hilarious results. The most risky probably for me was the X wing deconstruction and reconstruction.

00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,970
Because that toy when I was a kid was super dope and very rare. But it worked. What didn't

00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:47,010
work was the speak and spell Teddy Ruxpin thing I used to do. That was weird but I tinkered

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:55,770
a lot and got into computers at an early age. My dad was at a nuclear power plant and writing

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:03,310
code and would red pen it on the kitchen table and I would sit alongside him. And my aunt

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:09,870
and uncle who lived in Reading started the first third party Microsoft training center.

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:18,819
This was a laptop, by the way. It was like 26 pounds for those of you younger than me.

00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:25,400
Legit, I'm probably screwing around there with DOS. I was lucky and surrounded by computers.

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,260
And my dad bought a Commodore 64 when I was 8. I sat down with it over Christmas break

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:37,270
and taught myself BASIC. That was rad. He brought home accessories, a printer and a

00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:51,630
cassette drive for storage. And a 300 baud modem and got us a CompuServe account. I could

00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:57,310
connect to the BBS before the Internet was a thing and pull down code and muck with it.

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:04,989
I had a game and changed the names to Jesse because I was the hero. I tinkered. And at

00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:12,910
my high school, we had a UNIX box sitting there. I'll play with that. The teacher was

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:22,000
like, here is the manual. I taught myself C and played around with UNIX. I was into

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,039
computers and hacking on stuff. But I was going to be a chef. That was the plan. That

00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,680
was the career. Since I was a little kid, I cooked all the time and loved it. I don't

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:42,710
mean like Papa Geno chef. I was like full on people who swear at you and legit cooking.

00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:51,620
I got pretty good and I was 21 and I was a round chef at a really well reputed restaurant.

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:59,509
Third in charge in French brigade grade and making $7 an hour and there 70 hours a week.

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:04,729
It was pretty crap. And I remembered I liked computers and I wondered if there was any

00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:13,810
money in that. Turns out there was. So, purely on hustle, I got myself a job at Sun Microsystems.

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:22,319
There was 97 or 98. 98. It was fairly unheard of at the time to get into software engineering

00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:31,809
any place. Sun was just cream of the crop. This was an educated and well informed hustle

00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:37,550
I played. I became a contract recruiter there, wrote my req, found a manager I wanted to

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:43,349
work for and made them hire me. This was not a hustle anyone can do. This was pretty well

00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:51,749
executed. But I did it. I had the basic skills. I could write C code. I knew UNIX enough.

00:05:51,749 --> 00:06:00,060
Whatever. I hustled hard. And I bought the entire O'Reilly catalog. And read books and

00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:07,800
coded and hacked on shit. But most importantly I worked like 70, 75 hours a week. Oh, god,

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,710
I worked 80 hours last week. Y'all ever work 80 hours? It's actually really hard. And so,

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,150
I'm talking like Saturday night I was in the lab. Monday morning, I would be there at 7:00

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,039
in the morning. I worked all the time. And that's because I felt like I had this deficit.

00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,880
Hi to fill in the blanks, right? I had to work harder than anyone else around me. These

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,680
guys had master's degrees. I worked with a woman who had a Ph.D. Whoa. They're smart.

00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,710
I'm not. I got to work real hard. And I did. I worked really hard. I landed in a test which

00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:46,970
was at the time almost retired tech support people who liked to post buttons. I'm going

00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,339
to write code. We were writing kernel software and I wrote auto something in the kernel to

00:06:53,339 --> 00:07:01,229
test other drivers. What the hell are you doing? I wrote a service with a like minded

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:09,839
friend. We could click a button and allocate hardware and run tests. We went after it really

00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:16,999
hard. But what I really wanted to do, I wanted to be in development. And I didn't feel like

00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:23,059
I deserved even the job I had. I was succeeding. I was doing really well. I was working really

00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:29,151
hard. I could give people code reviews that was useful. But I felt inadequate. And imposter

00:07:29,151 --> 00:07:34,999
syndrome is this thing where it manifests as a fear of you being exposed as a fraud.

00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:40,899
And I actually had a bit of a secret, right? I never lied about not having a college degree.

00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:45,310
But I never corrected anyone, either. And I should be clear about that. They wouldn't

00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:53,340
say you had one, it was assumed everyone had them, right? So, the problem for me was, I

00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,559
really wanted to get into development, but I figured if I raised my hand and said, would

00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,520
you move me into development, they would realize I was there and just fire me. What are you

00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:07,699
even doing here? So, what ended up happening is the development manager approached me and

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:12,613
asked me if I wanted to join her project as a development lead. And I was like, oh, well,

00:08:12,613 --> 00:08:18,589
like, okay. I guess I can keep the job. And this should have been a clue to me. Right?

00:08:18,589 --> 00:08:23,419
Not only I was afraid. I was hiding under my desk about asking for a promotion, a lateral

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:29,619
move. They moved me into a lead position. That should have been a hint. But so, spoiler

00:08:29,619 --> 00:08:35,190
alert: It wasn't. Right? And I always sort of chased my tail around feeling inadequate.

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,899
I worked on Solaris which was at the height of the UNIX wars. We all had our own hardware,

00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:46,209
own OSs and drivers for everything. I didn't know people didn't write drivers from scratch.

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:53,089
I wrote four. They're shipping in the OS today. They make up the backbone of the IO stack

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:59,220
in some of the applications. And the whole time, I felt like a failure. I felt like a

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:05,529
fraud, I felt like I didn't belong there. But I kept going. And I kept getting promotions

00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:12,920
and salary increases and better teams. And that's the thing to note here. Imposter syndrome

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:18,310
is thing where if you suffer from it, you're not crazy. You know you're not crazy, they

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:23,620
didn't fire you. You're not shown the door, they didn't take your card away. However,

00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:29,731
you feel like at any moment someone with a clipboard is going to say, yeah, you were

00:09:29,731 --> 00:09:36,260
a total mistake, by the way. Pack your shit. So, success did not feel like success for

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:43,649
me. From any sane reckoning, I was successful. But I didn't feel like it. And that's the

00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:50,149
thing. Quite the opposite. You end up feeling like the more work you get, the more you have

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,740
to do, the more you have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone because otherwise,

00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:59,310
you know, it's just gonna be proof that you're not good enough. Right? You keep taking on

00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,380
more stuff and you love in this whole realm of never really being comfortable. So, I didn't

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,250
know this was a thing. This is a thing now you Google it. We didn't have Twitter, we

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:16,190
did, but it was for talking about hot pockets and stuff. There were no thought leaders around

00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,790
this. And five or six years ago, my wife linked to an article. This is imposter syndrome.

00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:27,131
It's got a name. You should read this. I put it away for three months. I finally read it

00:10:27,131 --> 00:10:34,970
and I think I have this imposter syndrome. And my wife was like, no shit, you think?

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:41,970
And sometimes the imposter syndrome is exacerbated or even caused by childhood trauma. It interacts

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:49,200
really oddly with anxiety disorders that may pre exist. ADHD has having interesting implications

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,760
in this space. I might just tick all those boxes just so you know. But I know a lot of

00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,279
people who have similar feelings. And have had similar experiences that none of those

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:06,149
boxes are ticked. So, this really can affect anyone in any walk of life. This is by far

00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:11,009
not a tech industry thing. It's not even a work thing. I'm a parent of two beautiful,

00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:15,200
amazing children with my wife. And every now and then we sit down after they've gone to

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,120
bed. All right, we're the parents. I keep forgetting. We're waiting for the adults to

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:27,430
show up. We're actually them. This can impact you kind of across the board in various ways.

00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:34,220
So, eventually those of us who survive this long enough, we have to admit that we are

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:41,690
successful and have value. And all of the successes pile up and it's proof. It's too

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:47,959
much proof to say, we don't deserve this, we're frauds, right? Eventually, you have

00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:54,500
to admit, to, this is a thing. But what do we do with it? Where do we go from there?

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,320
I don't know if you have done cognitive based therapy, talk to people. That is the first

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,810
step and can make it harder. When you realize this, now what? Let's talk about what it is

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:13,189
first and how it manifests and then I hope to share some advice with you around how I've

00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:19,610
dealt with it. First and foremost, the idea of imposter syndrome is just that. It's not

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,200
an excuse for being significantly misaligned with your responsibilities at work. Let's

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:29,459
not confuse that. Like, you can't be sort of just a, you know, like a frontend web developer

00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:32,920
and be like, I'm going to do some network socket programming. You need to read a book

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,250
and do some stuff. This is around feeling like you're inadequate and you don't belong

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:43,980
after you have provable success. You feel like literally a little kid playing business,

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,360
right? You're in there, you're doing it, you're making it happen. But something doesn't quite

00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:56,689
feel right. Relatedly, what happens is that this kind of builds up the system where it's

00:12:56,689 --> 00:13:02,629
difficult for us to take a compliment. It's hard for us to enjoy accolades. To get a promotion

00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:07,290
sometimes for me was really stressful. And I got them. It happened. I started as a level

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,470
I engineer and went all the way up to staff without ever leaving the company. It happened

00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:18,040
where I progressed in my career. But I always felt like this, yeah, great, thanks. I'll

00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:23,750
just be hiding under my desk. Please don't fire me. And a lot of that leads to another

00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:30,529
telltale sign of what imposter syndrome really manifests itself as, which is shame, right?

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,770
So, it's very normal, especially in tech, to be thrown into the deep end and be out

00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,091
of your element. Right? That is how we learn. You do new things. This is the good. Keep

00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:44,500
yourself fresh. The difference is when someone who suffers from imposter syndrome is thrown

00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:52,470
into the deep ended of pool, they feel like they're supposed to know it. We feel like

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,920
we're supposed to know all the things all the time. And often ironically, as I said

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,870
before, it ends up pushing us to take on even more work in that space. Because we're trying

00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:09,220
to proof that we belong. We try subconsciously to take on so much work that we become sort

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,519
of irreplaceable. You just try to replace me. Go ahead and fire me. No one is actually

00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:24,499
trying to fire me. So, in the worst cases, this can result in exercising and exhibiting

00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:30,470
self sabotage and extreme procrastination, right? We can do some really messed up things

00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:35,490
with these magical things called our brains, right? The human brain is an amazing thing

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:42,850
and it has amazing capability was making what we think is truth actually a reality. If you

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,920
feel like you're a financial wreck, you might not manage your money very well. If you feel

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,170
that you're inadequate in your profession, it's quite possible that your brain will play

00:14:54,170 --> 00:15:00,610
tricks on you to the point where, yeah, you might just procrastinate and blow a deadline.

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:07,480
I could do this better, but I don't feel like I'm going out or that branch, right? You're

00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,850
building a self fulfilling process if I which can be really destructive. This is the worst

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:19,100
case. But I have seen this. I had a mentee who nuked his career because he couldn't deal

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:25,459
with the amount of imposter syndrome systems he was dealing with. He took six months off.

00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:32,300
He's now a manager at a very large company at a successful group in the company. It took

00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:41,089
him a while to understand that he was causing the problems for himself. I'm not a therapist.

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:48,460
I'm not a counselor. I'm here to share my experience and some advice around this. And

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:55,019
I do suffer from imposter syndrome. So, I put this CFP out and the conference said,

00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:02,079
yes, sure. That's great. Come on and talk. Really? I'm not sure I qualify. Isn't there

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:07,839
somebody better? Like, anybody? So, that's my imposter syndrome kicking up, giving a

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:14,240
talk on imposter syndrome. Which is just awesome. So, let's talk about some things we can do.

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,880
So, one of the most important things that I did in my life was just to start focusing

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,930
on being positive. To focus on the positive things that people said about me. So, sort

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,899
of stop any time I felt like I was really significantly out of place and turn around

00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:35,589
and say, okay. Here's all the things I have done that are provable. I have succeeded.

00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,639
No one has fired me. Yes, I feel this way right now. I feel like a fraud. That is okay.

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,430
I'm going to move on and I'm going to give this talk. Because I have success. This is

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:52,829
really important. Bad vibes are bad, right? Sarcasm and sort of cutting other people down

00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:58,860
is just sort of a self defense mechanism that we might build up. It's kind of toxic, right?

00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,800
So, part of being positive is also about finding positivity in other people. And it's amazing

00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:10,600
when you start throwing out just little comments to people, how much that can click with them.

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:14,950
And maybe it starts a conversation where, like, you're talking with somebody and they

00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,660
say, you know, I kind of feel like a fake or a fraud. And you say, me too. And they

00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,790
say, whoa, you got your she shit together. What are you talking about? That happens a

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:35,040
ton. Where somebody who feels the same way. Just being brave. Admitting it's a thing and

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:42,210
impacts your life is a big deal. We don't like to always sort of give names to issues

00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:47,930
or anxieties that we have. And then to sort of admit that we have them, right? It doesn't

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:54,020
define us. But it also there is a certain element of this that has to do with acceptance.

00:17:54,020 --> 00:18:00,290
And just facing it. When we face it head on and we talk openly about it, it tends to take

00:18:00,290 --> 00:18:04,680
a little bit of power away from that thing. So, when we talk about imposter syndrome,

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:13,420
we're taking some of its power away and we're owning it. Don't be afraid to not know a thing.

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,940
This is huge. This is probably my number one go to thing having mentored junior engineers

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:27,920
and, you know, people in my teams for a decade. Even before I realized this was a thing, I

00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:34,390
realized I used to pretend to follow conversations a lot because our imposter syndrome says,

00:18:34,390 --> 00:18:38,220
if you don't know what's going on in this conversation, that would be your fault. And

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,110
then you end up with shame around that. Sort of like you don't to want show that. You end

00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,710
up rushing back to your desk and Googling something. Especially if you signed up to

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:50,940
do it. [ Laughter ]

00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,880
Don't be afraid to be the person in the room that says, so, what the hell are you talking

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,010
about? That's fine. Because what you find out, especially in meetings is 70% of the

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,310
people don't know what the hell that guy was talking about. And that means he probably

00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:11,290
didn't know what he was talking about. That's okay. That helps him grow too. So, being open

00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:18,090
about not knowing what the hell is up is fine. This relates to conversations we have in the

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:26,290
hallway, at water cooler, in the hallway track. We know all the things, don't we? Yeah, the

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:35,060
curdamanifram, open sourcey. Have you looked at the CNCF landscape? You don't know all

00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:42,440
those things. Chris doesn't know all those things. You don't have to know all the things.

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,420
When we sort of nod and push through things we don't know. We miss an opportunity to learn

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,930
about those things sometimes, right? I mean, you can go Google it. But maybe it turns out

00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,040
you're talking to one of the maintainers of a project. And that's a connection that you're

00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,470
gonna get maybe because you said, I don't know what that is. What is it? I'm really

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,260
excited to talk about it. Let me tell you. You're not going to know all the things. The

00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:11,191
most important thing is that you know it's okay you don't know all the things. And that

00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:21,060
brings us to fear of missing out, F O MOO. Cancel it, ignore it, push it to the side.

00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:28,790
What you can do is not nurse it and foster it, make it your pet. When we have the Twitter

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:35,690
going and the tech feeds flying at us. There's 15 new open source projects. In the case of

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:41,420
one of the spaces I focus on, three new service mesh this is week. Yay. Even needs that, right?

00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:46,640
Like, we can't stay on top of everything. And not staying on top of everything is fine.

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,920
For your job, if you need to know about a thing, you'll know about it if. If you're

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,020
working on static monolithic pages on the web, you're going to know about Gatsby, right?

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:02,250
You're not going to miss it. It and you miss it, maybe you don't need it. And if you hit

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:07,790
a problem you don't have a solution for, go a Googling and find a solution. That's how

00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,060
it works. We don't have to know all the things. FOMO is thinking you have to know all the

00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:23,310
things. Just let it go. One of the negative things is through social media. For me, this

00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:31,060
was a particularly interesting aspect of my discovery around this is I realize over the

00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:39,540
course of a year or two, after realizing I have imposter syndrome, FOMO is a thing. Wait.

00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:43,930
Why am I following all of these people that I'll never meet and when I look at their stuff

00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:50,300
on Instagram and Twitter, I end up feeling like crap afterwards. This is not news. We

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,630
all know that social media can be a little dangerous, right? If you look at all these

00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:59,850
perfect lives which we all know are not perfect and compare ourselves even subconsciously

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,850
as we're spinning through and looking at things for three and a half seconds each, that can

00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:09,810
be really toxic. I'm not saying don't use social media, but maybe if this resonates

00:22:09,810 --> 00:22:15,950
with you, maybe cull some of those, you know, some of those channels and some much those

00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:23,860
content provides that are make you feel a surgeon way. This is a good one. This is really

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,750
obviously ever obvious. But this is one of the last pieces of advice that I came on through

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,900
talking with people about it. It's an obvious one. If they hired you, let's just presume

00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,970
that they did this on purpose. [ Laughter ]

00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:43,870
Right? And that's kind of a big deal. Like, so, you went in, did some whiteboard leap

00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:50,690
code. Cool, ran you through the wringer, here's the laptop and the key, push to prod. Probably

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,170
meant that. And you took a job with them. Assume they know what they're doing. And maybe

00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:01,780
just do the job, right? And this goes for, you know, that grad program that you applied

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:07,752
for and got into. Goes for the conference you applied to. & got accepted at. They probably

00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:14,640
know what they're doing. What's the alternative? The talk reviewers for DevOpsDays Boston,

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,710
they don't know what they're doing. Of course they do. This has been a great conference.

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,470
They know what they're doing. Stanford knows what they're doing in the grad program. And

00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:28,610
your company knew what I was doing hiring you. Maybe accept that. And maybe let that

00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:38,410
be the first provable success, right? Last, sort of know that this is a pretty big tribe.

00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,230
This is a thing that we're, you know, speaking of social media, flip it on its head and go

00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:47,850
looking for people who feel maybe some of these thoughts, right? You'll find them. Because

00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:54,170
there's a lot of them. It's said that three out of four people will experience symptoms

00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:59,960
of imposter syndrome at some point in their careers or their lives. That's a lot of us,

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,700
right? So, know that if you feel this way, you're not alone. And a lot of the things

00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,030
that I've said have worked for me are things that have worked for a lot of people. I've

00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:14,360
now since gone and done the Googling and read the blogs and watched the YouTube videos.

00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,900
And I was like, hey, that's what I went through and last, how I dealt with it. And there is

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:26,050
A lot of people out there at every level of this sort of dealing with this. And people

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:35,240
from all walk of life. From different careers, different ages. Different parts of the world.

00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:39,970
And part of part of knowing that is maybe connecting with that community. Maybe sharing

00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:44,300
your story, maybe getting okay. So, maybe not doing a conference talk to share your

00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:49,720
story. Maybe that's a little bit out there. But find a person to chat with, have a coffee.

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,350
Like I said, it's amazing how often we open up about this and the person you're talking

00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:00,160
to is like, oh, my god, me too. I thought you were like the shit and now this is a good

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,740
thing. Because, again, now we're taking pour away. If I'm not wrong and you're not wrong,

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,860
then it's wrong. That's a pretty powerful thing. Get out there, get out of your own

00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:17,380
head and maybe just sort of experience this with other people. Mentoring is a great thing.

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,640
Giving code reviews. We shoot a lot of stuff down. Find a really nice little piece of code

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:25,540
and just be like, that's awesome. I love how you did that. Now here's the eight things

00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,400
you have to fix. But that's fine. Give some positive in there because it can be really

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,781
impactful. The more we share, the more we process around this, the more that we all

00:25:34,781 --> 00:25:39,730
start to realize we're really in this together and that we all deserve to be here. Thank

00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:40,730
you. [ Applause ]

00:25:40,730 --> 00:26:00,110
What are you doing with those pikes? Are there questions? I'm not qualified for that. But

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:09,580
we have time. >> Are there any questions? If you don't mind

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:16,160
waiting for the mic. AUDIENCE: First, thanks. That was awesome.

00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,260
So, like I guess probably like almost everyone in this room I deal with imposter syndrome

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:28,664
fairly often. But I think over time my take has changed a little bit. I think there's

00:26:28,664 --> 00:26:31,890
a lot of good that comes out of it. Pushing me forward. Like you mentioned, you probably

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,410
wouldn't have learned as many things as you learned if you weren't pushing yourself. Do

00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:41,740
you have any comments on like the good sides of imposter syndrome?

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:47,480
JESSE: Absolutely. I have thought that before. I left it out, I do believe I wrote into the

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:54,440
talk that thing. People coming new to it or just realizing they're experiencing these

00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,240
symptoms. I tend to not go that route because I don't want to give I don't mean to give

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,250
it any power. But you're absolutely right. It is part what have drove me to build the

00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:10,950
career that I have. It's part of what made me learn so much. The power for me comes from

00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:16,921
being able to benefit from that and then realizing, okay. The other stuff wasn't that great. The

00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:23,710
constant low ebb anxiety that I lived through, I'm sure you identify with, not great. The

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:32,530
account. And I really got to go into the lab and learn about that thing, just in case.

00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,960
Maybe that's not great. Learning new things is great. Being driven to do it because you're

00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:43,580
afraid to not, that's where we have to really sort of draw that line. And that can get really

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,800
unhealthy. And like I said, it can get to the point of really destructive stuff. Thankfully

00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:56,330
I didn't get too far down that road. And hopefully you didn't either. That's where we can catch

00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,510
it. Okay, this is motivating, this is great. It's actually pushing me forward. Having a

00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:08,410
little fire behind your ass is pretty good. Feeling like you're on fire, not so much.

00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:14,380
Having that balance. Having awareness around the negative side effects is really empowering.

00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:23,620
AUDIENCE: Hi. I just wanted to ask you, do you feel this not only in your career, but

00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:28,830
also in your life? Because I feel like I need to do 100% in all areas. Is that normal?

00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:38,230
JESSE: Yes. So, the financial ruin thing. So, yeah. That was me. And also, parenting

00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:42,861
is very challenging. Because those are little people that are now actually big people. Like

00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:46,520
my daughter's almost my height and it scarce the crap out of many me they have done the

00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:56,620
wrong thing. She's in honors classes, she's beautiful, has tons of friends and she's mildly

00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,250
athletic. [ Laughter ]

00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:07,120
Love her to death. So, she she is and she is her own person. I'm not saying she is my

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,900
success. But I can apply these guidelines and say, that's provable success parenting.

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:17,790
Let's just take a little faith that we did something right. She's not a wreck. And in

00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:23,080
fact she's thriving. So, I think that that's important. I think it's a tricky thing where

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:27,330
if you have these feelings and these anxieties and then you actually do have problems that

00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:33,840
you have to address, that's an even more difficult thing. You know, I luckily, I succeeded. I

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:38,100
could have actually just ended up under a bad manager and been fired, right? And maybe

00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:44,800
it would have had nothing to do with me. Children are their own thing. Financial tides are their

00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:48,800
own thing. You can't control everything. So, I think, again, sort of like when we take

00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,670
the positive with the negative, we have to identify sort of what we own and what we don't.

00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:58,940
And watch for the negative side effects of that. It's good to have some awareness that

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:04,490
parenting is important. Feeling like a failure when you have provable success. That's the

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:18,970
part we want to avoid. Yes. I absolutely do. AUDIENCE: Hi. Check! There's a little different

00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:24,720
between 3 millimeters and 7 millimeters. JESSE: Lead vocalist, everyone.

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:33,820
AUDIENCE: The mentee who took the time off. Did he or she make the call? Did you as a

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,090
mentor make the call? How did that happen? JESSE: Very specific information. At Sun,

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:46,380
we had a PI (P, performance improvement plan process. You have six months. You're underperforming

00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:54,020
and there are issues. So, before that process was triggered, I said, let me because, we

00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,960
had a strong mentorship program. Not the same team. I was in touch with that person's manager

00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:07,850
frequently. She informed me that she was thinking about a PIP for him. And I said, hey, let's

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:14,070
take a pause on that and let's dig into what's going on. At that point he admitted he had

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:19,230
some type of misalignment. Something was going on. And then from there, he did leave the

00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:23,760
company. We stayed in touch. He took about half a year to put his head back together.

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:28,040
Realized that he was in a pretty negative place. Started identifying that stuff and

00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,690
went on and rebuilt his career. And he speaks too.

00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:38,130
AUDIENCE: Thank you. >> So, here is my sad responsibility. To be

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,560
on time. The next session is happening now should be happening shortly. But before you

00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,962
start moving, first lets thank Jesse for being here.

00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:47,962
[ Applause ] And also, we do a monthly meetup. This is

00:31:47,962 --> 00:31:48,962
my little spiel. I'm one of the organizers of the monthly meetup for Boston DevOps. We

00:31:48,962 --> 00:31:49,962
have no problem find finding hosts. What we have problem with is trying to find people

00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:50,962
that are capable of having a cultural conversation. That means similar to that, that mean something

00:31:50,962 --> 00:31:51,962
that helps people move along in their thought process around mentoring, around recruiting.

00:31:51,962 --> 00:31:52,962
Around all sorts of stuff. Just deep dives on technology. There's a lot of that matters.

00:31:52,962 --> 00:31:53,962
With that said, who is native to Boston here? Okay. So, a lot of you folks. Of those folks,

00:31:53,962 --> 00:31:54,962
who has not been to our monthly meetup in the past couple months? Okay. All right. So,

00:31:54,962 --> 00:31:55,962
we usually do this towards the end of the month. If it's hard for you to make it, let

00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:56,962
me know. There's the Slack channel. I mean, I'm on Twitter too. Just find me. But let's

00:31:56,962 --> 00:31:57,962
figure out how to get us back there so that we can have this kind of conversation there

00:31:57,962 --> 00:31:58,962
too. Because like I said, I hate to shut this down. And this is really powerful and beneficial

00:31:58,962 --> 00:31:59,962
stuff. So, even if you're not, for the folk who didn't raise their hands because they're

00:31:59,962 --> 00:32:00,962
not directly in the local area, I think we also have some folks who donated some camera

00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:01,962
stuff from days of yore. And we can do live streams now. So, if this is a relevant topic,

00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:02,962
reach out on Slack and, say, yes, we want to talk about this more. And it would be nice

00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:03,962
if it was soon. With that said, once again, thank you, Jesse.
