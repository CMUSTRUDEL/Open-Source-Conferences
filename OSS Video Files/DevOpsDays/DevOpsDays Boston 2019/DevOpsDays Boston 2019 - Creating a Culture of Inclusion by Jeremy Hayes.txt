Description: 
	Creating a Culture of Inclusion by Jeremy Hayes

We talk a lot about creating a DevOps culture within an organization. While this conversation usually focuses around technology and delivery challenges, it also helps to look more broadly at how to create a culture of inclusion. When I think about a culture of inclusion, I imagine organizational customs, beliefs, and actions that truly honor and welcome all individuals. To me, such a culture encompasses a multitude of factors, including race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, mental health, religion, ethnic and cultural background, and socioeconomic status.

As a white gay dad to two kids of color and as someone who used to do diversity training for a living, I’m acutely aware of issues of difference. My husband and I like to think we’re living in a bit of a safe bubble here in Boston, but racial prejudice and profiling happen everywhere. Remember the incident at the MFA earlier this year where kids on a school trip were profiled and harassed? I feel that I have two important duties to my children in this regard. First, prepare them to live in a world where people will likely see and treat them differently because of the color of their skin. Second, do my small part to change that world – one person and one organization at a time.

In this talk, I’ll provide some ways you can help foster a culture of inclusion within your own organization. Whether you’re the token member of an underrepresented group or if you’re just trying to make your organization more welcoming, you’ll find some strategies you can start using today.

So I'm a little bit of a theater nerd.

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,190
I don't know if you know this, but the production that's going on right now is being directed

00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,040
by Billy Porter which is kind of amazing.

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,270
So at some point Billy Porter was standing here telling people what to do and now I'm

00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,250
going to stand here telling you guys what to do, so that's pretty awesome.

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,140
I feel like I should have a giant hat or a long, flowing gown.

00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,280
But I'll make do without.

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,469
My name is Jeremy Hayes I'm a DevOps engineer with Liatrio and I want to talk to you about

00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:58,670
creating a culture of inclusion.

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,780
Doesn't that sound really nice?

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,100
Sort of like world peace or free doughnuts?

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,580
And there are lots of reasons this is important to me personally.

00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,720
In my past lives I've been a queer activist, a social justice educator, an out gay man

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,710
and really somebody who cares about humanity.

00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,930
But then I became a father.

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,840
And now these 2 Little Darlings Drive everything I basically do, in addition to driving me

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,149
crazy.

00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:32,289
They have me think about what can I be doing about making the world a better and safer

00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:34,440
place for them?

00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:38,300
Because let's face it we live in a world where people are treated differently because of

00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,240
who they are and how they look.

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,160
Some people like to say that we live in a colorblind society or that we've moved beyond

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,950
seeing race.

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:53,170
But often the people who are saying that are not the people who experience racism on a

00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,399
daily basis.

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,979
And we've all seen headlines about how tech has a diversity problem.

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:03,330
Many of us in the room have probably felt it ourselves in one way or another.

00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,899
Whether you've personally experienced discrimination or feeling left out, or you've just looked

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:14,640
around your organization and noticed everybody here looks just like me.

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,599
Or conversely, nobody looks like me.

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,480
According to research from Glass Door, 66% of job seekers consider workplace diversity

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,569
as an important factor when they're looking at job opportunities and more than 50% of

00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:34,930
current employees want their workplace to do more to foster diversity.

00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,550
What we know that is just getting people in the room with different characteristics isn't

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,550
enough.

00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:46,180
It's a start, don't get me wrong, but we need to take a hard look at the culture and what

00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,780
we're doing or not doing to be truly inclusive.

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,560
When I talk about a culture of inclusion, I mean a place where organizational customs,

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,870
beliefs and actions truly honor and welcome all individuals.

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:08,280
Where factors like race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability status, men 258

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,769
health, body shape and size, cultural background, socioeconomic status, all of these things

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,329
don't prevent someone from being fully involved.

00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:25,129
A place where people are not just invited in, but truly made a part of the culture.

00:03:25,129 --> 00:03:29,069
So today I want to suggest some things that you can do to help create that culture in

00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,760
your own organizations.

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,719
The first thing is just to be yourself.

00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,680
You are valuable.

00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,340
You bring a unique set of talents and perspectives to your organization.

00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,279
And you should feel comfortable bringing all the aspects of your identity to work with

00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:49,279
you.

00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:53,760
When we are our whole authentic selves, we make it easier for others around us to do

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,230
the same.

00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,900
If we're going to truly value difference, we have to make it visible.

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,819
And when our culture is truly inclusive, the parts of our identity that make us unique

00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:11,120
become common and ordinary, rather than strange or exotic.

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,760
For example, I talk about my husband in casual conversation just as much as my coworkers

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,799
talk about their opposite sex partners.

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,970
It should be completely normal to ask for an adjusted work schedule because you're fasting

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,220
during Ramadan.

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:31,190
We all need to feel comfortable expressing ourselves to feel safe and included.

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,280
I was recently attended hashicon earlier this month and I heard an engineer there talk about

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,090
how he created a movement that led to the creation of pride stickers and other swag

00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,040
just because he asked for it.

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,340
He wanted to be visible as a queer person in tech, and by doing so he created a space

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:57,370
that made it easier for others to be visible as well.

00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,660
It's not always easy.

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,840
Especially if you feel like you're the only person like you.

00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,510
But sometimes I think you'll be surprised what you'll find when you ask.

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:13,810
On the other hand, if you work at an organization that doesn't respect you for who you are,

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,390
try to find allies within the organization who can help you bring about the change necessary

00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,530
to create a more inclusive culture.

00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,040
If that doesn't work, it might be time to look for a different organization that will

00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,010
show you the respect you deserve.

00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,390
For some of us, that's easier said than done.

00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:35,040
I know I'm speaking from a place of privilege as a cis white male pretty established in

00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:40,910
my career and not everybody can take those kinds of risks.

00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,370
The second thing you can do is be mindful of the words you use every day.

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,820
I'm not talking about political correctness.

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,360
I'm talking about being aware of the language that you use and how it impacts the people

00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,100
around you.

00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:57,370
For starters, try using gender neutral terms.

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:04,390
I have a coworker from California who calls everybody dude or bro.

00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,140
Basically every sentence either starts with dude or ends in bro.

00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,930
It's just what they do in California, right?

00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,180
But he's trying really hard to change.

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,560
But like any other habit, it's hard to break.

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,580
Or take my husband, for example.

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:24,050
He talks about the fact that his father, and I'm sure many of other people's fathers did

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,480
the same thing, taught him that it's polite to call a group of women ladies.

00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,490
Hello ladies, how are you today.

00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,480
But that can be perceived as condescending and you don't know if everybody that's perceived

00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,110
as a lady actually identifies that way.

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,190
There are lots of alternatives and it takes practice.

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,650
I encourage you to try it out this week.

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:52,050
And give yourself permission to make mistakes.

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:54,660
Because that's what matters, the trying.

00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,450
That's what signals hey, I get it.

00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:00,250
And I'm working on being inclusive.

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,360
It's not about being perfect and always getting it right.

00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,830
And it's perfectly okay to stop and correct yourself mid sentence.

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,210
Even that opens up the opportunity for further dialogue.

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,310
And I can't talk about gender inclusive language without mentioning pronouns.

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:24,270
With singer Sam Smith it's a bid of a hot topic right now.

00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:31,970
We need to respect how people choose to identify.

00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:36,950
I've started including my pronounce in my e-mail signature, my Twitter bio.

00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,900
When everybody is explicit about their pronouns, including the people whose gender is not typically

00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:46,830
called into question, it actually makes it more comfortable for someone who identifies

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:52,830
as nonbinary or whose presentation may not match their pronouns, makes it easier to self-identify

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,590
and ask to be called what they want to be called.

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,240
The third thing you can do is get to know people as individuals and treat them as such.

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,950
Each of you is a complete, complex person with a multifaceted identity, and so are all

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,090
your coworkers.

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:17,680
Try not to rely on stereotypes are about a person's appearance or background.

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:24,550
At the end of the day we're all individuals with our own unique blend of nature and nurture

00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,450
that governs how our personalities manifest.

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,950
When we start treating people differently or excluding them, we miss out on the value

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,599
that they bring to our organizations.

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:42,070
A good friend of mine who is a diversity trainer talks about the tape recorder that plays in

00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,630
our heads.

00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:48,280
For you young people in the room who might not know what this is -- think of a Spotify

00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,080
play list.

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,930
[ Laughter ] These are all the messages that we picked

00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,870
up when we were growing up.

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,550
From our families, our school, our church, wherever.

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,370
They're all the things that you noticed even subconsciously.

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,620
Maybe it was noticing how people were treated differently based on how they looked or where

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:11,939
they were from, or even explicit messages like, this group of people is lazy or women

00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:14,120
belong in the kitchen.

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,839
All of these messages are recorded on the track in your head, and it's constantly playing

00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,050
in the background, whether you know it or not.

00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,579
So now when you see someone who looks a certain way walking down the street, without thinking

00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:31,800
about it, you're calling on those messages and making assumptions.

00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,350
That's called unconscious bias.

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,520
It's very hard to undo that old programming.

00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,110
Because it's often rooted in fear, superstitions and ignorance, and usually the people we got

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,190
it from were the people we grew up trusting the most.

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:55,250
My husband talks about his mother who basically has a contention that anyone who doesn't love

00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,570
animals is evil.

00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,720
And you can't trust men who wear pinky rings.

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,689
These are both silly things, right?

00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:07,249
But those assumptions are always there.

00:10:07,249 --> 00:10:10,959
But you can undo this too.

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,550
It requires a lot of self-awareness.

00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,640
One thing that can be helpful is to ask your colleagues and your friends, people that you

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,830
trust, what they think your biases are.

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,680
Having an open and honest conversation about the biases other people see us displaying

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,370
can make us aware of our blind spots and open up further conversation.

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:39,180
Try to notice when you're making an assumption about someone you don't know and think about

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,510
where is that coming from.

00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:46,550
What are the messages that are playing in your head.

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,490
According to the national Alliance on mental illness, about one to five adults in the U.S.

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:54,370
experience mental illness in a given year.

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,550
Some are more debilitating than others, but the reality is that most of us will be impacted

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,399
by our own mental health at some point in our lives.

00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:08,189
This can include illnesses like depression or anxiety or neurodevelopment disorders like

00:11:08,189 --> 00:11:11,459
learning disorders or autism.

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:16,410
The fourth thing you can do is practice empathy and compassion with your coworkers who might

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:19,879
be struggling with any of these issues.

00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,399
For most of us, our jobs are stressful.

00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,910
But it's usually a positive stress that challenges us to get better at our work.

00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:35,139
But we have to understand that everyone comes with different experiences and needs.

00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:38,509
For me, standing up here and doing public speaking is stressful.

00:11:38,509 --> 00:11:40,839
I mean just check my heart rate monitor.

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,330
But for someone with anxiety it can be really hard, almost impossible.

00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:53,921
James Meickle talked last year about some great strategies about mental health and there's

00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,339
a link to that in my slides.

00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:04,120
The open sourcing mental illness is a great resource and they have lots of videos and

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,149
resources on their website.

00:12:08,149 --> 00:12:12,319
Talking openly about mental health can help to reduce the stigma around it and help contribute

00:12:12,319 --> 00:12:14,629
to a more inclusive culture.

00:12:14,629 --> 00:12:19,810
I'll tell anybody who will listen between my husband and I we see two individual therapists

00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,819
and a couples therapist.

00:12:22,819 --> 00:12:30,730
The CEO of my company talks about he and his wife's therapy and likens it to an oil change.

00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,920
Take the time for self-care.

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,209
We all know that burnout is a real thing.

00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:41,029
If your company allows for mental health days or has unlimited PTO, take advantage of that

00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:45,790
time when you need it and be as open as you feel comfortable with your supervisor about

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,509
what your needs are.

00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:50,509
Fifth.

00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:57,129
Pay attention to the people in your organization whose voices and perspectives are marginalized.

00:12:57,129 --> 00:12:59,709
It's probably not even intentional.

00:12:59,709 --> 00:13:05,529
How often have you been sitting in a room in a meeting and one of the dudes presents

00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:06,529
some idea.

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:07,529
Sorry.

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:11,879
One of the women in the group presents an idea and two minutes later some dude says

00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:16,110
the same thing and everybody is like oh, yeah, you're a genius.

00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:19,019
This happens all the time, right?

00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:24,230
Those of us with privilege have a responsibility to take notice and do something about it.

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:29,129
So the next time that female colleague speaks up, chime in and say hey, that sounds really

00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:30,129
interesting.

00:13:30,129 --> 00:13:31,129
Tell us more.

00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:34,069
Before somebody else can preempt her.

00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:39,379
We can't expect someone who's being marginalized to always be able to advocate for themselves.

00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:43,439
If you have colleagues you think might not be feeling included, check in with them and

00:13:43,439 --> 00:13:46,649
see how they're doing.

00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:51,689
It's important to have a working environment that's accessible to individuals with physical

00:13:51,689 --> 00:13:57,240
disabilities, but creating a welcoming space goes further than that.

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,199
Go beyond thinking about accommodation and instead look at inclusive design, which focuses

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:09,259
on making environments universally accessible and Taylor and JoAnn spoke about making our

00:14:09,259 --> 00:14:17,779
products more accessible but we also need to look inside our organizations.

00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:21,970
Think about someone with different needs from yours, what they might need, and make that

00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:27,040
the norm rather than the exception that they have to request.

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,300
That not only helps the person who might need that accommodation, it's also a clear signal

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,339
of inclusion.

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:37,149
Make your slide decks and websites that are easy to read by people with low vision.

00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:42,040
Provide trainings in a variety of modes for people with different learning styles.

00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,759
And it's not just about disabilities.

00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,429
Encourage your company to have lactation rooms, nap rooms, prayer meditation rooms to make

00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:52,829
sure your space is welcoming for everybody.

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,869
The goal is to make sure that everyone is able to fully participate.

00:14:57,869 --> 00:15:02,569
I was recently at another conference and when they were announcing lunch it was like, we

00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,579
have this great chicken sandwich on a wrap and we have the roast beef on brioche and

00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,689
it's great and some vegetarian thing.

00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:15,220
Later I was speaking with an attendee who had the vegetarian option said she should

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:21,480
have known the way they were talking about it it was an afterthought, lackluster and

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,089
you can tell she wasn't feeling very included.

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,360
If you're involved in the hiring process in your organization, take a look at your critical

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
processes.

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,209
How diverse are the individuals in your candidate pool.

00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:42,709
How can you actively reach out to candidates that have traditionally been underrepresented?

00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:46,160
Find organizations like the Resilient Coders we heard from this morning.

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,670
Talk to them and hire their amazing engineers.

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:53,670
Remember that unconscious bias we talked about before?

00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:58,639
Be especially mindful about it.

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,940
Research indicates those with ethnic sounding names in western countries are less likely

00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,699
to be selected for an interview than those with western sounding names.

00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,940
Notice when you're treating candidates differently based on their eye identity.

00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:22,529
If you see a female and a male candidate exhibiting the same behavior, do you treat them differently.

00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:27,239
Consider antibias training for your recruiting teams and hiring managers.

00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:31,889
And after hiring make sure you have clear objectives and explicit criteria for promotions

00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:33,940
and reviews.

00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:39,160
This morning we had a chat from underrepresented groups in tech one of things we ever touched

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
on was that.

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:46,750
A lack of clear expectations and smart goals makes it really for unconscious bias to sneak

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,750
in.

00:16:47,750 --> 00:17:00,279
At all of these DevOps Days conferences, we have codes of conduct that call out what behavior

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,209
is acceptable and what isn't.

00:17:03,209 --> 00:17:08,559
Encourage your organization to have one for itself, and be public with it.

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,930
People who have experienced harassment or fear experiencing harassment are more likely

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,270
to join your organization if they feel it's going to be a safe place for them or harassment

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,630
won't be tolerated.

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:25,949
The 2018 women in the workplace report found that only 27% of employees say that managers

00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:34,380
regularly challenge the bias language and behaves when they observe.

00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,480
And just 32% think their company swiftly acts on claims of sexual harassment.

00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,690
But it's not just sexual harassment we need to be aware of.

00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:50,490
Don't tolerate jokes about mental disorders or bias language about women, racial groups,

00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,690
LGBT people, anything.

00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,559
When you see behavior that's inappropriate or disrespectful, speak up.

00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,120
Change won't come if we're all silent.

00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:06,309
Finally, take the time to learn about the experiences of people who are different from

00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,769
you.

00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:12,660
Look for books, podcasts, blog posts from a variety of perspectives.

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:16,500
The uploaded slides from this presentation have links from some suggested resources that

00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,270
you can check out as a starting point.

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,269
I was just reading a thread on Twitter earlier this month about how to be less of a, quote,

00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:29,840
clueless white person, without asking people of color to do the work of educating you.

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,190
And the suggestion was go right now, follow 50 people of color on social media and just

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:36,899
listen.

00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:38,200
Don't comment.

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,330
Don't even retweet it.

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,330
Just listen.

00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,460
And you can do this with any identity that's different from yours.

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,460
So that's it.

00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,960
We've solved the problem, right 1234 seriously.

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,260
These are my ideas of what you can do today to help your organization and yourself be

00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,070
more inclusive.

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,990
I hope you took away something that can be helpful, and remember this is a journey that

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,179
we're all on together, and none of us are perfect or have all the answers.

00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,929
I really appreciate the opportunity to talk with you today.

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:11,429
Please check out this link.

00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:14,040
Give me your feedback, download the slides.

00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,331
If you don't get the Pearl Jam reference in the URL I can't help you.

00:19:16,331 --> 00:19:20,740
Thank you for being here today.

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,170
If you would like to talk more about it, please find me in the hallway.

00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,170
Thank you.

00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:24,171
