Description: 
	Are you including the fastest growing minority in your DevOps? Influence accessibility outcomes, no matter your role by Taylor Anne Snook  & JoAnn Becker

	00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:19,539
TAYLOR: Thank you everyone for being here.

00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:23,279
This is a really important topic to us, so we appreciate your attendance.

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,070
I'm Taylor Snook, I'm here with my colleague, JoAnn.

00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:27,070
JOANN: Hi.

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,569
TAYLOR: We're from Perkins access which is a division of Perkins school for the blind

00:00:31,569 --> 00:00:35,070
which is located down the river in Watertown.

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:51,850
I've put our Twitter handle on the screen.

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,379
It's@perkins_access.

00:00:56,379 --> 00:00:57,800
So one in seven.

00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:06,290
That is a very conservative estimate of the number of people worldwide that have a disability.

00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:12,400
So that's about 15% to 20% of the population.

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,960
And it's important to remember that many disabilities are not visible.

00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:26,860
People around you all the time have disabilities, and you may not realize it.

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:33,720
We group disabilities into four key categories, including visual, which includes blindness,

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,890
low vision, things like cataracts, glaucoma.

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:46,970
Auditory disabilities which include deafness, hard of hearing.

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:53,890
Cognitive impairments, learning disability, dyslexia, attention disorders, as well as

00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,430
people with memory impairments.

00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,200
And then motor disabilities.

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,590
So that could be paralysis, partial paralysis, limited use of your hands.

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:10,190
Arthritis or chronic pain, muscular dystrophy.

00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:17,850
So all these people use different strategies to access digital technology.

00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:24,170
Blindness typically people use screen readers, which is what JoAnn is going to demonstrate.

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,100
People also rely on keyboards and switch controls.

00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:33,470
So there's a variety of assistive technologies out there that empower these people to access

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,950
digital content.

00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:44,960
So with that I'm going to switch it over JOANN: And turn off your mouse.

00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:55,520
TAYLOR: Yes, thank you.

00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:06,090
JOANN: Good morning, everybody.

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:11,050
I decided I'm going to take you on a journey with me this morning.

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:15,450
First off, I am blind so I do use a screen reader for my PC.

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:20,890
I use JAWS and for my iPhone I use Voice Over.

00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:27,640
And the thing to keep in mind about a screen reader, it solely depends on keyboard use.

00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,790
I do not use a mouse.

00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,860
And so this website that I'm visiting today is not unique.

00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:44,770
I like to travel and I have visited numerous travel websites, and I haven't been very successful

00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,760
using them.

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,300
Somebody recommended to me why don't you go to Trip Advisor.

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:54,390
I thought that is amazing, I have never done that.

00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:57,130
I would love to read reviews.

00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,030
And this is a website I want to try out and see what the experience is like.

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:06,681
So this is not unique to Trip Advisor, but this will give you a sense of what it's like

00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,440
to find a flight.

00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:12,210
I want to go to Singapore after Christmas.

00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:18,449
This is a real life experience I want to have in my own life finding a flight and making

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:19,730
a reservation.

00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:30,060
The focus, I'm able to use keyboard navigation quick keys that will give me if I want to

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,060
know what the focus is.

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:41,879
Is that too fast for you?

00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:47,439
So I'm able to pull up a list of links and I'll show you that right now.

00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,110
>> This feature is only available.

00:04:51,110 --> 00:05:06,110
JOANN: There are 339 links that I can use, first navigation, first letter navigation,

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,410
get there really quickly.

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,759
I can also pull up a list of headings.

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,029
>> There is currently an -- JOANN: We don't want to do that.

00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:15,279
>> Escape.

00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,009
Headings list dialogue.

00:05:19,009 --> 00:05:22,749
JOANN: That's interesting.

00:05:22,749 --> 00:05:25,849
There's only one heading with all of those links.

00:05:25,849 --> 00:05:26,849
Hmm.

00:05:26,849 --> 00:05:27,849
That makes me wonder.

00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:31,490
And I'm also able to pull up a list of form fields.

00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,250
>> No form fields were found.

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,770
JOANN: If there were, it would have been told me what those form fields were, and that's

00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,659
simply areas where I'm going edit text.

00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:51,540
So when I went to Trip Advisor, I use key command to quickly locate text.

00:05:51,540 --> 00:06:09,249
I just use a JAWS 

00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,589
find command.

00:06:11,589 --> 00:06:17,830
>> Ready ready, find.

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:22,309
JOANN: There is a button.

00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:28,430
I can use B and locate buttons on the page, C for combo boxes.

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,740
X for check boxes.

00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,580
So those are just some of the various ways that I can quickly navigate.

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,240
So that's B for button, so I'm going to press the space bar.

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,240
And.

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,639
>> Sign up button.

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,900
JOANN: Nothing happened.

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,840
Even though it's labeled as a button, I can't activate it.

00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,329
Let me try enter on that button.

00:06:56,329 --> 00:06:58,659
>> Sharing travel advice.

00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,210
Sign-up button.

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,559
JOANN: So let me just pull up a list of links and see if I can find flights because I'm

00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,509
obviously not going to be able to sign up.

00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:14,629
TAYLOR: I just want to point out quickly that the button did actually work, but JoAnn has

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:16,339
no way of knowing that.

00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:22,370
Because a modal for those who can see has appeared on the screen, but focus hasn't moved

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,990
there, and it's positioned in the document object model at the end of all the content.

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:35,919
So when she presses tab instead of going into the modal, she's going to go into probably

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,059
post photos or write a review.

00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:41,830
In order to get to that modal which she doesn't even know is there, she would have to tab

00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:44,710
through all of the content on the page.

00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,999
So that's a critical issue.

00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:51,139
JOANN: And the bottom line is, when I'm using my screen reader, what I really want to achieve

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:52,139
is success.

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:55,059
I want to be independent, and I want to be efficient.

00:07:55,059 --> 00:08:00,020
And right now this isn't feeling like it's going to be either.

00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,389
Let's see if I can find flights.

00:08:01,389 --> 00:08:06,680
Let's see if I can sign up.

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:14,639
I'll use find again.

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,110
>> Escape.

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:22,819
There are no visited links on this page.

00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:24,419
Ready.

00:08:24,419 --> 00:08:47,790
JOANN: We'll try one more time.

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,970
Now we have 6 headings, 24 links.

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:53,059
That kind of information is helpful.

00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:59,389
>> Key flights from where, edit to where.

00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:01,459
Enter.

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,529
Singapore.

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:05,610
Enter.

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,750
Depart noon.

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,220
JOANN: Now I don't want to depart on that date.

00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,350
So let's see what I can do.

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:26,509
JOANN: These are the friggin clickables.

00:09:26,509 --> 00:09:32,569
[ Laughter ] These are all over the place.

00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:36,870
More clickables than you can ever imaginable hearing on one page.

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,440
This is telling me to click but there's nothing I can do with that clickable.

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,560
So I can't enter where the date is that I want to actually depart.

00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,940
>> Depart clickable.

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,180
Enter.

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,660
Depart clickable.

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:57,629
JOANN: Again, clickable, clickable.

00:09:57,629 --> 00:10:00,110
>> Click return.

00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:08,420
JOANN: So there's no way that I can actually choose the departure and return dates.

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:14,720
So in essence, I'm unable to plan my trip using Trip Advisor.

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,870
This is not unique to Trip Advisor and my experience is similar.

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,680
I'm not successful.

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,240
The bottom line is we want to make sure we properly label elements and make it possible

00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,020
for a screen reader user to be able to navigate the web page, to be able to access the form

00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,160
fields, fill out the information.

00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,360
And in my case, I want to go to Singapore.

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,230
So it will happen, but not on Trip Advisor.

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:48,730
Thank you guys very much.

00:10:48,730 --> 00:11:08,519
[ Applause ] JOANN: Taylor does have to use a mouse.

00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,230
TAYLOR: I didn't turn the mouse on then.

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:13,750
I did, but I used the keyboard.

00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:19,190
So you can see -- I think that's a very simple task.

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,790
Searching flights should be very basic.

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:28,379
And that's an incredibly frustrating experience, date pickers in general typically have a lot

00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:30,250
of barriers.

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,770
So I wanted to quickly talk about how accessibility benefits users that don't necessarily have

00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:36,779
a disability.

00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,250
Or they have what we call a temporary or situational disability.

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,490
So an example of this might be an arm injury, where you suddenly can only use one hand.

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,680
Or you're a new parent and you're holding a child and you're trying to do something

00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,910
on your laptop or phone and you only have the use of one hand.

00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,550
So really, accessibility benefits everyone.

00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:02,830
I'm sure everyone in this room has used closed captions at some point.

00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,300
That's a form of accessibility that really benefits everyone.

00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:13,110
Particularly if you like watching British television like I do.

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,220
[ Laughter ] So some myths I just talked about, it only

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,829
benefits a few.

00:12:18,829 --> 00:12:21,360
A lot of people think accessibility is very expensive.

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,379
It can be expensive, but not if you're incorporated it into your process.

00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:33,399
Accessibility does not mean your website or digital properties need to be ugly.

00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,390
And a lot of people think that it's just the developer's job to make things accessible,

00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,449
and that couldn't be further from the truth.

00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:44,850
So I'm going talk more about that.

00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:48,940
And people think it's optional, which is not true at all.

00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:54,870
There's lawsuits constantly throughout the United States, because it is part of the ADA.

00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,720
The Americans with disability act.

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,380
So you're actually required to have an accessible site.

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,220
By the end of this year there will be more than 6,000 lawsuits in the United States and

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:13,009
that number has grown exponentially in the last three years.

00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:21,279
So in terms of the legal requirements, most lawsuits reference WCAG, the web content accessibility

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:30,710
guidelines, and these are really criteria that help you reach compliance and check the

00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,710
accessible of your site.

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:39,470
It was first published in 1999 by the W3C right across the river at MIT.

00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,709
It was updated last year.

00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:45,149
Most of the new criteria have to do with mobile devices.

00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:50,930
So it's based on four principles, which are perceivable, operable, understandable and

00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,210
robust.

00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:58,089
And there's 78 criteria, but we typically -- they're broken into three conformance levels

00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:00,890
and we typically focus on A and AA.

00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:07,790
And there's 50 criteria within those.

00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,190
Cost of a bug fix.

00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:12,370
This is the same thing as cost of an accessibility barrier.

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,860
So I'm sure everyone in this room is familiar that the cost of fixing something exponentially

00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,610
increases throughout your process.

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:29,170
So that's why we encourage everyone to include accessibility, including reviews, at your

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,459
design stage.

00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:33,319
We review wire frames all the time.

00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:39,139
We can spot things that are going to be potential barriers and advise you on how to implement

00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:44,009
those before a barrier presents itself.

00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:52,529
So now getting into what your role and responsibility is, because everyone plays a role.

00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:58,079
So for designers, it's really important that you review your color palette and design guide

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,670
and make sure you're incorporating accessibility into that.

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:10,720
I'm showing example on the screen of the Perkins color palette.

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,600
It provides information how to use those colors to ensure accessibility.

00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:24,470
And that means making sure you're using colors that have a significant amount of contrast.

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:30,230
And there's actually a specific ratio required by the WCAG.

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,019
Using legible fonts that are scaleable.

00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:39,230
That's critical, because people use browser zoom all the time to increase text size, and

00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:45,320
again, a lot of that comes with responsive modes.

00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,209
Defining a highly visible focus indicator.

00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,730
While JoAnn was demoing this you were able to follow along where she was because of that

00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,880
outline.

00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,920
So often we see that outline, either not mean contrast requirements or be hidden entirely.

00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:06,910
And in that case someone who's sighted, who's using a keyboard, cannot navigate your site.

00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,839
Because they don't know where they are.

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,410
Take advantage of white space.

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,389
Do your best to align text to the left side of the screen.

00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,200
Make interactive elements easy to identify.

00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,350
So people can tell where something is going to be a button or something is a link.

00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:30,550
And that goes to my next point, which is don't rely on color alone to communicate information.

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,509
A lot of times we see links within paragraph text.

00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:39,089
And the way you're indicating that it's a link is purely on color.

00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:44,019
So that's not going to help someone who is colorblind.

00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:54,699
And one out of 12 men in the United States has a form of colorblindness.

00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,821
So also for designers talking about structure and layout, you want to make sure that you're

00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:03,610
defining those structures and regions for your developers.

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,430
So that they know how to implement those.

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,620
I'm showing on the screen a way to annotate your designs or wire frames, to indicate what

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:19,470
the desired focus order is, what your desired regions are, and also when you're designing

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:25,450
headings, which as JoAnn demonstrated is critical, making sure that you can provide multiple

00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,770
styles for one heading level.

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,250
And that's important so that content authors don't feel like they have to pick a certain

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,560
heading level just because they want a certain style.

00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,910
It's important that your headings are nested properly.

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:48,730
So level 1 comes after or level 2 comes after level 1 and 3 comes after level 2 and so on.

00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:54,600
Forms, making sure your labels are properly positioned and that they're permanently visible.

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,210
There's a trend to use placeholder texts instead of labels, and that's an accessibility barrier

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,190
for a lot of users.

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,350
And there's tricks you can do for this.

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:11,240
You can have placeholder text that when someone interacts with that form field, then sort

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,630
of shifts into a smaller text.

00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,270
But it's still permanently visible.

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:27,030
And then minimize animations and content that play automatically.

00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:33,040
So for content authors, in terms of writing copy -- again, a lot of the things I'm talking

00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,950
about overlap across roles.

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,180
For people writing copy, it's important to use plain, consistent language, and try to

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:49,040
break up long text or paragraphs with graphics or convert long paragraphs into lists.

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,130
This really benefits people with cognitive disabilities.

00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:56,020
It benefits screen reader users who can navigate by lists.

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,100
And it also benefits people who maybe English is not their first language.

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:05,910
Again, I can't say it enough, use headings to summarize regions of content and create

00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,400
that sort of table of contents for your page.

00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,050
Using semantic mark-up.

00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,770
So again, lists.

00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:19,360
Making sure data tables are actually in tables, because screen reader users can understand

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,480
tables and navigate them a specific way, when they're implemented properly.

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,780
Providing alternative text for alt images and that varies by type.

00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,240
I could literally talk about alternative text for three hours so I'm not going to go into

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,530
that, but I will gladly talk about that more.

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,820
Making sure links and buttons communicate their purpose.

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,950
An example I have on the screen is from our Perkins access page.

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,860
And you can see we've put a lot of white space.

00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:54,770
We've simplified the text into the different services we've provided and we've incorporated

00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,770
decorative images to make it easier to understand.

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:05,380
And then the link that's below that says more services.

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,990
And that is just communicates the purpose better than if you were to just say learn

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,990
more.

00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:14,860
JoAnn was November gating by links and she heard learn more.

00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,910
What the heck does that mean?

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,810
That could mean anything.

00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:22,960
But by having it called more services, she understands that exactly where that link is

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,630
going to bring her.

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,920
Media, closed captions, audio descriptions.

00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,070
And again, when you're writing your form labels, make the labels easy to understand.

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,400
Provide specific instructions.

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,060
And it's so important that when you're using error messages, that you're specific and you

00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:47,030
provide a suggestion on how to fix that error.

00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:49,340
So developers.

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:57,240
If you take away one thing from this talk, I want you to remember to use semantic HTML

00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,830
as much as possible.

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:04,620
This is critical to accessibility, because they are universally understood by assistive

00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,080
technologies.

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,170
So when you start coding with divs and spans, screen readers don't treat those as interactive

00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,170
elements.

00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:18,630
There's a bunch of things you can add on to those to make a screen reader realize that

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,820
it's supposed to be a button or a link, but it's just not necessary.

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,410
You can still use them but don't use them for interactive elements.

00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:34,330
Use them to style content and you can style those semantic elements as well.

00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,990
So it's just not necessary.

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:44,240
So I'm showing on the screen someone using a monkey wrench to try to screw in a Phillips

00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,370
head screw, and that's sort of how I feel sometimes about how things are being coded.

00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:55,960
There's semantic HTML that already does everything you need it to do, but we're trying to reinvent

00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:03,050
the wheel and it's causing so many accessibility barriers.

00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,580
So things you can developers can also do.

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,370
Go through this keyboard checklist.

00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,820
Make sure you're implementing a skip to main content link.

00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,920
That doesn't have to be permanently visible.

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:20,160
Basically what you want that to do is when a user first tabs into your page, that link

00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,820
should become revealed.

00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:24,720
And that lets them skip over the navigation which is critical.

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,150
If you can imagine every time you go to a website you have to tab through everything

00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:38,150
in the navigation, that's so burdensome and can be painful for certain individuals.

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,730
Making sure all your interactive elements receive focus, making sure that your focus

00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:48,650
order matches the visual presentation, which makes it easier for people to follow along.

00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,070
Check for keyboard traps.

00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:56,930
This could be infinite content loading, Twitter feeds, things like that that are on your page.

00:22:56,930 --> 00:23:00,200
Making sure all your media controls are accessible.

00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,980
YouTube is -- their controls are accessible if you're using a YouTube player, but there

00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,690
are a lot of players out there, and it's important to check that.

00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:14,550
And then of course form controls.

00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,550
More checks.

00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:19,240
I'm going to run through this quickly.

00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:23,710
Making sure you're using the title attribute to give something unique title so people can

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:29,320
-- that was the first thing JoAnn heard when she got to that page, so that helps her understand

00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,390
where exactly she's located in the site.

00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,980
Properly nesting headings.

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,760
Using landmarks and that's how when you're able -- screen readers are able to recognize

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,040
and quickly navigate to different regions.

00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:46,290
Making sure all images have all attributes.

00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,910
Developers should not take on the responsibility of writing alternative text, but they should

00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:53,310
make sure that it's being implemented.

00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:57,670
Use buttons and links according to what their purpose is.

00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,900
So buttons should trigger actions.

00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,080
Like the pop-up modal.

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,860
That was great that that was a button.

00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,230
It's just too bad JoAnn couldn't actually tell that it did anything.

00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:13,750
But you know, at least they coded it as a button, but really that's not good enough.

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:20,220
And links should navigate users to new pages or to anchor tags within the same page.

00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,620
Use your Lang attribute on the HTML element.

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:29,760
That helps not only how content is read to screen readers, but also if someone is translating

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:48,770
a language, and use the code validator provided on the screen.

00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,500
Quickly I'm going talk about quality assurance.

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,140
You have to have accessibility built in -- let me quickly say make sure there's a process

00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:04,300
for users to both provide feedback about your site and access customer support when they're

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,710
reaching a roadblock.

00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,710
Include accessibility in your testing procedures.

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,510
It's great to use automated tools.

00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,690
I encourage that.

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:18,480
Just know they're only going to surface 20%, at best 40% of the issues on your site.

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,230
And user testing.

00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:26,650
Always incorporate users with disabilities into your user testing.

00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:31,700
And then establish a clear workflow and timeline for remediating issues.

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,810
Real quick.

00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,870
Purchasing.

00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:40,470
So you might have a limited role in this, but make sure that when you're looking at

00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:46,130
third-party tools, or any kind of software that you're thinking about accessibility.

00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:51,840
I've provided a list of things to ask both your current vendors and future vendors for.

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:58,290
So ask if they have an accessibility statement or a VPAT which is a voluntary product accessibility

00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,160
template.

00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,190
When you're writing contracts include accessibility in those contracts.

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:10,220
For recruitment if you're hiring someone, make sure you're asking about do they have

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,220
knowledge about accessibility, do they know what WCAG is, have they ever used a screen

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,700
reader before.

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:23,050
ARIA is a coding language they should be familiar with.

00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:29,300
Even better if they're a certified professional in accessibility core competencies which is

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,210
something that JoAnn and I are both certified in.

00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:35,280
Commit to hiring people with disabilities.

00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:39,650
That is so important.

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:45,420
People really -- it's really unfortunate how much people underestimate people with disabilities,

00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:49,960
and they think that people can't do a certain job.

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:53,700
You can be a coder and have a visual impairment or be blind.

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,690
Like, it really -- anyway.

00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:59,510
Make a commitment to hiring people with disabilities.

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:04,530
And then make sure your online applications or whatever your application process is is

00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:07,710
accessible to all people.

00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,880
So now what?

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,890
What can you do?

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:17,380
So I would say today, or right now, if you're done listening to me, ditch your mouse.

00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:23,860
Try navigating a website, your own website or another website using just the tab and

00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,860
enter key.

00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:28,440
You want to go backwards, it's shift tab, most of you guys probably already know this

00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,580
but maybe you've never tried to do that on your site.

00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,150
JOANN: May I make one recommendation?

00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:41,940
If you are using JAWS, I recommend turning off the screen and using the keyboard.

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,660
That will change your experience as well.

00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,610
TAYLOR: And you can do that on your iPhone.

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,760
If you have an iPhone, Voice Over is built in so you can try that as well.

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,800
Find a role-based training for your team.

00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,240
That's something that Perkins and I provide a lot.

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,550
I do a lot of role-based trainings, which is why I'm trying to jam a million things

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,870
into this presentation, because usually each role I talk about for three hours.

00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:07,710
Know your legal obligations.

00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:09,770
Be familiar with WCAG.

00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:13,630
Again incorporate users with disabilities into your testing.

00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:17,770
Ask your third parties about what they're doing about accessibility.

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,810
And become an accessibility champion.

00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:26,140
We really all have a responsibility to promote this in our organizations.

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,860
Ask your leadership about it.

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:31,670
Form an accessibility committee if one doesn't exist already.

00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,790
There's a lot that you can do.

00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:37,330
To really improve the experience for all users.

00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:47,450
I apologize to our captionist because I know I talked way too fast.

00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:52,820
So do we have time for just a couple of questions?

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,432
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned automated tools in passing.

00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:55,432
It seems like a really good first cut would be inserting automated testing into our CI

00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:56,432
pipeline.

00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:57,432
I just did a quick search and there's a ton of tools.

00:28:57,432 --> 00:28:58,432
Can you help whittle the field down there, is there anything you can recommend?

00:28:58,432 --> 00:29:01,451
TAYLOR: The question was about automated tools and the benefits and which, because there's

00:29:01,451 --> 00:29:05,760
a lot of them out there, which ones are great.

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,240
I want to be careful about endorsing any of those tools.

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,081
But I will say like a free one that you can quickly -- there's a Chrome extension, you

00:29:15,081 --> 00:29:24,180
can run it on any site, is wave.org it's either wave.org or wave.com and you plug in your

00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,880
URL, that's produced by Web Aim that's a great one.

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,810
There are a lot out there.

00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,640
But that's a really easy, free one.

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,070
There's built-in accessibility into the Chrome developer tools as well.

00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,340
So definitely take advantage of those.

00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:49,960
And again, I have to do a disclaimer that this catches 20, at most 40% so make sure

00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,980
you're still using manual testing.

00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,440
But it's a great place to do a quick check on your site.

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,760
In the balcony?

00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:59,380
AUDIENCE: Can you speak to apps?

00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,630
[ Off microphone ] TAYLOR: The question was about apps and where

00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:08,500
does the burden lie in terms of making things accessible whether it's with the device or

00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:12,080
with the app developers and it's a little bit of both.

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:20,780
It's important that the platform is providing options and ways to make your apps accessible.

00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,490
Again I can talk for hours about making apps accessible.

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,650
I know Apple has made a really big commitment to making things accessible, but you have

00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:36,460
to understand how to use their accessibility API.

00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,460
So that's important.

00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,060
You need to make sure apps rely heavily on icons, so you need to make sure those have

00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,240
accessible labels.

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,330
That what it is, whether it's a button or a form field is communicated to the user.

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:56,170
And then the API also lets you add hints, which just provides users with more information

00:30:56,170 --> 00:31:00,450
about how they should be interacting with that.

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,620
So again, it's a little bit of both.

00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,940
Both the device and the developer.

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,230
And then that's about native apps.

00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:18,510
And then with web -- with responsive websites that you're looking on a mobile device, that's

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:22,010
I would say more of responsibility.

00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,130
Not just on the developer.

00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,540
They're not responsible for everything.

00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:30,950
But anyway, those who are working on the site.

00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,680
It's their responsibility to make sure that the responsive design is accessible and follows

00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,570
WCAG would apply to that.

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:40,620
Maybe one more question?

00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,020
I'm not getting the hook yet.

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,160
In the middle.

00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:45,910
AUDIENCE: [ Off microphone ] TAYLOR: The question was where can you get

00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:51,640
feedback for what you put in your applications.

00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,780
Shameless pitch, these are all services that we provide at Perkins Access.

00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:59,380
So we do audits, manual testing.

00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,390
We do kind of like a quick, really quick high level check of your site.

00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:09,840
Deeper than an automated test but just to give you a sense of where you are in terms

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,250
of accessibility.

00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:21,890
Again, we're not the only company that or organization that does this, but I think we're

00:32:21,890 --> 00:32:22,890
the best.

00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:24,100
[ Laughter ] But yeah.

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:28,520
It's really important to know about accessibility in your own organization.

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,860
But also work with a third party that has subject matter experts on that.

00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,050
JOANN: And we definitely have user feedback.

00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,050
So that's a good thing.

00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:42,420
JOANN: A great service that we provide at Perkins is we also do user testing.

00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,000
We do audits assessments, trainings, and user testing.

00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,580
And I work with JoAnn a lot moderating those tests, doing things like going to a site and

00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,590
performing a simple task.

00:32:55,590 --> 00:33:02,500
Hospital site, can the user find a doctor, that's a very basic task that everyone needs

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,940
to be able to do.

00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:08,590
And so I'll test with her, we'll identify the barriers and that's so valuable because

00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:15,080
even as someone who tests against WCAG all the time, things are always going to surface

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:22,100
in a user test that I don't -- that don't stand out to me, because there's experiences

00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:28,070
different and I can see I have a bias in how I'm interacting with things.

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:30,210
I think we're out of time.

00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:34,810
If you do have more questions my e-mail is on the screen.

00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:42,620
Our Twitter handle, please, I will check that immediately for more questions and our website

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,410
is Perkinsaccess.org.

00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,410
Thank you so much for your attention.

00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:45,411
