	All Tech is Debt by Dave Stanke

We all spend a lot of energy trying to discover tech debt, and eliminate it. Fat chance! In this talk, I will convince you that all tech is debt, and that it’s futile to try to live debt-free. Why? Because none of your tech is an asset; it’s all liability. From the minute it’s created, it’s already old. It has security vulnerabilities. It’s not idiomatic to whatever the latest trends are. It’s eating you from the inside! So what can you do about it? Throw away as much as you can. Let someone else build the rest. And most importantly, focus on your real assets: your people, your culture, your brand. Your customers! Technologists are an asset. But tech? That’s debt.

	00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:04,950
Thank you.

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,170
Is that working?

00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,910
Yeah.

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,949
Seems to be working.

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:17,949
All right.

00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:19,720
All tech is debt.

00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,720
All of it.

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,830
Let's take a look at some tech debt.

00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,830
Let's see.

00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,100
Oh, too far.

00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,460
There we go.

00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,460
Yeah.

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,550
That is some shiny tech debt, am I right?

00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,550
Electric.

00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,320
It's got self driving capabilities.

00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,070
Just some amazing, amazing tech debt.

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,350
Whoo!

00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,789
Planetary scale tech debt.

00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:44,500
Hyper interconnected fiberoptic tech debt.

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,940
And the latest tech debt.

00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:54,460
There one's got 12 megapixel cameras and this tech debt even has dark mode.

00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,199
All tech is debt.

00:00:56,199 --> 00:00:57,199
Are you convinced?

00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,250
That's okay.

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,120
28 more minutes.

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,489
My name's Dave.

00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:04,650
I'm a developer advocate with Google Cloud.

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,360
I have been doing this for a long time.

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,920
And whatever this is something I have been doing.

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,250
I have been a product manager, CTO, database type, all the things.

00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:21,520
And I'm here to talk to you about how tech debt maybe isn't such a bad thing.

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,120
Let's take a look.

00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,190
First of all, what the heck is tech debt anyway?

00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:30,880
Well, to be honest, I think it's a bit of a know it when I see it kind of thing, right?

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,800
Tech debt is the stuff that has that tech debt smell.

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,820
But to be more specific, blah, blah, blah...

00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,150
But I think tech debt is this.

00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,210
Tech debt's that stuff where you open up and look at it and you say yeesh!

00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,640
I'm going that fix that.

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,940
Later.

00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:56,070
[ Laughter ] Now, we spend a lot of time hunting down tech

00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,070
debt.

00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,270
Trying to contain it.

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,670
Exterminate it, prevent it.

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,940
But I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna happen.

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,910
And that leads to some rough feelings.

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,039
It feels like, you know, no matter what you do, no matter how much time you spend on tech

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:13,709
debt, it never gets any better, right?

00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:14,709
Tech debt get.

00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:16,610
My code is so bad.

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,750
You talk about it with your friends.

00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,170
I'm sure you've done this.

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,269
You're bragging around you.

00:02:21,269 --> 00:02:23,510
Look although that application, it looks good.

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,780
Underneath, it's garbage.

00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,760
Check me out.

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,819
Or you might get into tech debt anger.

00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,319
My manager won't let me fix my stuff.

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,569
My boss won't let my fix my stuff.

00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:38,459
I'm going to be so glad what it all breaks.

00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:40,709
That will show them.

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,910
And then you realize that doesn't get you anywhere.

00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,379
That's tech debt sadness.

00:02:45,379 --> 00:02:46,730
It's everywhere.

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,519
It's not going anywhere.

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:49,530
Boom.

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:53,469
Chin up, little pups.

00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:55,499
I'm here to tell you that it's okay.

00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:58,200
In fact, it's better than okay.

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,860
It's irrelevant.

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:04,409
Because first of all, debt isn't necessarily a bad thing.

00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:07,499
So, I remember when I bought my apartment.

00:03:07,499 --> 00:03:10,269
And my friends would say, congratulations!

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,269
You own an apartment.

00:03:11,269 --> 00:03:13,310
And I'm saying, I don't own an apartment.

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:16,079
I own a massive pile of debt.

00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:18,469
Anyone here who has ever had a mortgage, right?

00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:22,650
I went from having assets from having a huge deficit.

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,939
I am negative wealthy.

00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:27,519
so, it's like, what are you congratulating me for?

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,969
But then I realized, they were right.

00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:31,489
It was worthy of congratulations.

00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:32,629
Because I had something.

00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,849
I had a cool new place to live.

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:35,859
Bigger and better.

00:03:35,859 --> 00:03:37,200
And then you know what?

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,650
A few years later, I sold that place.

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,060
And I made money off of it.

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,900
Now, do you think I made money by paying down all of my principal on my mortgage?

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,230
No.

00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,769
I made money because the price went up.

00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:53,670
So, that debt was really good debt.

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,310
Here's the other thing about tech debt.

00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,159
You can't escape it.

00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,450
It's always going to be there.

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,819
You're gonna have to learn to live with it.

00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,560
So, first of all, let's take a look at how everything is tech debt.

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,099
And I'm gonna convince you of that.

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:12,870
So, first of all, can we agree on this?

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,600
If it doesn't give you value, it's debt.

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,100
Now, take a look.

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,000
This is all your tech stack, right?

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,500
Look at all that crazy stuff in there.

00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,100
All of stuff is you don't know about, care about.

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,760
It's not helping your users at all it's debt.

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,610
The only part that might bring some value is the business logic, right?

00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:35,440
That's the stuff that your business runs on.

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,320
Except here's the thing.

00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,200
Your competitors have that too, radio I thought?

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,410
So, most of that isn't actually value.

00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,940
It's just the cost of doing business.

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,810
The object thing that might possibly have some value, this tiny little bit right here.

00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:52,650
The stuff that you have and your competitors don't.

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,090
So, that's not debt, right?

00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,090
Yeah.

00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,840
Yeah, it is.

00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,640
And here's why.

00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,490
Tech is constantly changing.

00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:04,410
No one's gonna argue with me on that one, right?

00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,060
Changing like crazy.

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,100
And that means by the time you ship something, it's already old.

00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,820
You designed it and you built it in a world that no longer exists.

00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:22,390
That means it's already debt the second it leaves leaves your repo.

00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,920
Here's a debt smell.

00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,590
This is when you have to when it takes extra time to work on something.

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,110
Before you can, you know, make progress on it, right?

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,110
Do you have that?

00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,140
You dig it up.

00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,590
Who is the jerk who wrote this?

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,570
And you realize it's you.

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,770
That time, you have to spend too much time understanding something.

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,140
It only happens in one case.

00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,970
You just wrote it.

00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:49,940
It's gorgeous, it's beautiful.

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,300
And then you write it down and forget most of it, that's on purpose and ship it away.

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:01,360
By the time it's deployed to prod, it's long gone and it's debt.

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,640
You know another thing that's debt?

00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,180
Those pesky users.

00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,150
Because here's the thing about debt, right?

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,580
Is that if you can't just fix it, that's a debt smell.

00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,710
Like, I want to change that, but I'm not allowed to.

00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,410
What's a big reason why you can't do it?

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,030
Because someone is using it.

00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,690
That's why you can't just turn it off, fix it and turn and back on again.

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,800
Every user your system has is another bit of tech debt.

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,900
In fact, think about that serious hairball, that nasty, nasty thing that you hate so much.

00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,550
That worst tech debt.

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,080
Why can't you throw it away?

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,110
People are using it.

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,960
In fact, the thing that the people use the most is the thing you are going to have hardest

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,490
time making changes to.

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:54,120
That crappy thing, your business is built on that thing.

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,030
That dumpster file is your greatest asset.

00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:05,220
But it's worse than that, because not only is all tech debt, all tech is a ticking time

00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,750
bomb.

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,680
Think about a zero day exploit.

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,780
That zero day, that's not the thing that thing was written.

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,000
That's the day someone figured it out.

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,080
It was in the code before then.

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,470
It's not code.

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,660
And we're using the fancy CI/CD systems to pump out exploits faster and faster to our

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,960
users.

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,890
All of our tech is a ticking time bomb.

00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,840
But it kind of doesn't matter.

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,620
Let's take a look here.

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,720
So, I'm going to talk about potatoes.

00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,670
When I make mashed potatoes, here's how I make them.

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,080
First, I pick out beautiful potatoes.

00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,970
Perfect, you know, Yukon gold, all equally sized, unblemished skin.

00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,400
And then I peel them super smooth into these beautiful pebbles.

00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,750
And then I cut them up into perfectly sized cubes.

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,772
And then I boil them.

00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,120
And then I mash the hell out of them.

00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:08,670
So, no one knew, and no one cared how beautiful my cubes were.

00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,230
I had something happen like this back when I was at my startup.

00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:15,520
It was actually as I was leaving the startup.

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,000
Before we had any kind of an exit.

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,710
But I had my time and I was exiting.

00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,700
And I had this system, it was a subscription system.

00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,550
On the way out, that thing it full of tech debt.

00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:29,530
I don't want the next person, my successor, to inherit that.

00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:35,190
I'm going to do a lot of work and made it beautiful.

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:40,579
Rebuilt the surface with a REST API which was the hotness at the time.

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:45,570
And I put it into the loud which and made it scalable with auto scaling groups and really

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,570
well documented.

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,990
It was gorgeous.

00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,060
I wrapped it up in a bow.

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:56,399
And my successor came in and to his credit threw it away and replaced it with a SaaS

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,550
service that did most of the same thing.

00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,720
I knew that I delivered something of beauty.

00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,550
I'm very proud of that.

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,300
It was useless.

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,839
They have this saying.

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,170
No one wants to see how the sausage is made.

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,110
Have you ever seen how sausage is made?

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:15,060
I have.

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,230
I've done it myself.

00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,760
I've been to factories.

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,829
It's disgusting.

00:09:18,829 --> 00:09:21,970
Did I stop eating sausage?

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,290
No.

00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,480
Because sausage is delicious.

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,620
So, I want to tell you a different story.

00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,040
Probably don't want to watch this anymore.

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,600
I want to tell you a different story.

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,190
I mentioned that time that I was paying down all that tech debt, right?

00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,790
What was I not doing at the time?

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,150
Well, I wasn't paying attention to our other product.

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:44,910
Now, this other product, this was this was debt incarnate.

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,680
It was the Java app.

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,079
It had a bunch of stuff in struts.

00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:52,740
A third of that was replaced with spring, a third of that was custom libraries.

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,050
It had hibernate, it had MyBatis, custom SQL.

00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,279
And it had a reporting system that no one understands.

00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:08,470
We built it, but we forgot how was with built.

00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,120
I was ignoring that.

00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,230
I didn't want to touch it.

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,360
A couple years later, the company got acquired.

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,810
Did they get acquired because of the beautiful tech debt free thing I was working on?

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,810
No.

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:23,540
Or the thing my successor replaced it with?

00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:28,009
It was the horrible hairball that everyone got a payout and the invest everything and

00:10:28,009 --> 00:10:29,110
got their money back.

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,120
Don't just alone to me.

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,250
Let's look at tales of debt.

00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,380
Horror stories, you ready?

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,949
All right.

00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:42,240
This is a programming language.

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,449
This programming language has been around for a long time.

00:10:44,449 --> 00:10:50,480
And it's had a bunch of features glommed on to it like really like clunky implementations

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,180
of generics and of Lambdas.

00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,839
And it actually can't run on any hardware.

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,910
It needs this extra virtualization layer to do anything.

00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:07,550
And on top of that, it has a feature in it that its own inventor called a billion dollar

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,550
mistake.

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,620
So, this must be a terrible failure, right?

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,620
Oh.

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,390
Oh, I'd use that.

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,339
How about a communications platform?

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:19,689
All right.

00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:24,860
This one was designed for asynchronous slow communication of text messages.

00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,310
And people are just abusing the hell out of it.

00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,970
Putting video on and synchronous communications.

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,670
It's a stateless protocol.

00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:38,110
people generally rigged all these stateful communications on it so people care about.

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,009
Every day there's a new security flaw.

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,110
Everywhere is running away in droves, right?

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,009
It's actually kind of successful.

00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,910
All right.

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,129
Let's look at a container orchestration platform.

00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,220
I don't think there's anything wrong with Kubernetes.

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:03,149
I just have to say Kubernetes at least once every talk or they take away my DevOps card.

00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:05,570
It does have over 2 million lines of code.

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,360
Or should I say, 2 million lines of debt.

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,999
Living in the beautiful, clean, debt free world.

00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:15,249
These are success stories.

00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:17,249
You ready?

00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,079
This one is an operating system.

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,079
They get clunky.

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,809
Someone built this beautiful operating system.

00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,310
Object oriented all the way down.

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,589
Multi threading parallelism, an awesome UI.

00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:33,559
It must be on everyone's desktop, right?

00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,339
Have people even heard of this one?

00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:36,339
Okay.

00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,339
I don't know.

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:41,089
How about social networking?

00:12:41,089 --> 00:12:44,129
You know, a lot changed since the days of MySpace.

00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,589
New features.

00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:47,070
A lot of cruft built up.

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:52,069
What if you built it on really great strong principles?

00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,899
Facebook is based on PHP.

00:12:53,899 --> 00:13:00,350
Surely a modern language can deliver a better platform, right?

00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:02,350
Oooo.

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:04,329
This next one is good.

00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:10,410
This was a system where the code, the source, had been around for decades.

00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:11,410
Literally.

00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,889
And unchanged.

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,189
And I mean, my god, it was so old.

00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:17,370
And so, they did a whole green field project.

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,629
They completely started from fresh.

00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:22,620
They did a lot of user studies, did testing.

00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,059
They really went for it and made a brand new green field reimplementation.

00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:33,279
It wasn't quite the seller that they wanted.

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,370
But I don't mean to say that tech debt is a good thing exactly.

00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:40,790
All things being equal, we would rather not have any.

00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,910
If you have more than you want, there are ways.

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:47,720
I'm going to talk about ways to get rid of some of that tech did the by getting rid of

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,059
some of that tech.

00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:53,259
I just want to make a moment to appreciate my son here.

00:13:53,259 --> 00:13:55,119
Out of the mouths of babes.

00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:57,380
My son said this to me the other day.

00:13:57,380 --> 00:14:00,569
I'm so, so proud.

00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:04,009
So, first of all, open source.

00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:09,920
If you've got tech that does something that someone else is gonna do for you, use it.

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,190
It's free.

00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,470
And that means that problems in it, the debt, are not your problems.

00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:17,379
They're someone else's problems.

00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,999
Even if you are, you know, really possible and engaged and want to say, well, it's my

00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:21,999
problem too.

00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:22,999
You have help.

00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:25,509
You can share the load.

00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:30,369
Even better, pay someone so that you don't have to think about it.

00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,929
If there is a hosted provider, a SaaS service, any way you can simply just get that code

00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:38,470
away, that is a win.

00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:41,860
Until you can focus on what matters to your customers.

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,720
This way, you can't even see the debt.

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,890
Let alone have anything to do about it.

00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,269
It's locked away.

00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:51,579
It's proprietary.

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,259
If you are a worrier, though, and you need something to worry about, I can give you things

00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:56,929
to worry about.

00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:58,880
First off, product debt.

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,339
Think about your customer service people.

00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,639
Think about your overloaded manuals.

00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,059
And think about work arounds.

00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:11,410
All of those things are likely to be places where your product is not meeting your customer

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,410
needs.

00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,410
That's debt.

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,050
How about relationship debt?

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,499
Are you spending so much time worrying about your tech that you're not really paying attention

00:15:19,499 --> 00:15:21,329
to the people around you?

00:15:21,329 --> 00:15:22,339
Or self care debt.

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:23,440
You matter too.

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,730
Take yourself out to the movies to the spa.

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,779
Whatever it is.

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,319
Don't worry about that perfect tech.

00:15:30,319 --> 00:15:33,339
It's never going to be perfect.

00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:35,139
Because you know what?

00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,339
You can't win.

00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:41,110
Tech is a really, really bad investment.

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:43,060
Think about the cell phone you bought five years ago.

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,339
How much did you spend on that?

00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:47,339
300 bucks?

00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:48,339
500 bucks?

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:49,339
800 bucks?

00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:51,009
How much is that phone worth now?

00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:53,660
But I got good news for ya.

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,660
I'm going to tell you about a sure fire investment.

00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,790
This one pays dividends.

00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,209
It's your team.

00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:08,759
In this crazy fast world of tech, you can win by investing in a team.

00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,759
Your users don't care about your tech.

00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,230
They want a service, a product, an experience.

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:20,379
And the best thing you can do is to deliver something to them as fast as possible before

00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:23,600
the crushing burden of tech debt has a chance to catch up to you.

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,749
The only way to do that it is to build a strong team that can understand your customers and

00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:31,569
deliver quickly.

00:16:31,569 --> 00:16:41,100
And that means investing in a team by building the skills of your team, build culture, build

00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,560
communication practice.

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,630
And importantly, build empathy.

00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,279
And keep teams together.

00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:49,809
Don't think project teams that are trying to deliver some tech.

00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,189
Think product teams.

00:16:51,189 --> 00:16:53,570
They're trying to evolve a relationship with the customer.

00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:00,100
Because, when it's all said and done web tech is debt.

00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,040
Burn it.

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,889
People are gold.

00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,780
Cherish them.

00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,839
And me, I'm Dave.

00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:11,850
And that's it.

00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,860
Thank you.

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,870
[ Applause ] >> We have time.

00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,620
DAVE: How crazy under time am I?

00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
>> We have time for questions.

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
Which I think is good.

00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
who has got one?

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
Come on.

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
Okay.

00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
We'll start over here.

00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
DAVE: So, how do you measure risk?

00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,435
How do you compare that with debt, tech debt?

00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:35,290
DAVE: Go back in time to last week in Columbus.

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,210
It's about how measuring risk is really hard and we don't know how to do it.

00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,770
[ Laughter ] To the what you would call an inspirational

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,679
speaker.

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:48,679
You know, really tough question.

00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:49,890
A lot of it's by experience.

00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,010
I would say.

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:57,860
All of my feelings about risk is based on instinct from having failed at a million things.

00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,309
But I would love to have more rigorous ways of figuring out risk.

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:05,929
And figuring out when that tech debt is a real problem think actually have to worry

00:18:05,929 --> 00:18:08,159
about that's messing up my efficiency.

00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:09,330
You have ideas?

00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,110
AUDIENCE: No, I was thinking open source.

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,809
And, you know, security vulnerabilities.

00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:16,890
DAVE: Sure.

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:20,030
And that's in fairness, there's a tradeoff here.

00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,600
That, you know, I recommend go use open source whenever you can.

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,070
I also say you're screwed because of all of your vulnerabilities.

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,220
Both are true.

00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:30,960
But, you know, definitely you want to have systems that can test all these things.

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,279
And a lot of great tools now in CI/CD world for testing your open source vulnerabilities.

00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,140
But even better in my mind is user hosted services.

00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,809
Sure, they could have vulnerabilities.

00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:46,559
But they probably won't because someone else is paid full time to make sure they don't.

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,549
And their risk of a vulnerability affects their entire existence.

00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,640
Whereas if you’re an insurance company that's a bad example.

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,909
Let's say you're selling shoes, you know, if you have a vulnerability, it's bad.

00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:00,960
But you might to the be out of business.

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,601
And a hosted service provider, they're done if they messed up security.

00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,601
>> Okay.

00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:06,601
Who else?

00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:07,601
If you want to have the conversation on risk, go do some open spaces.

00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:08,601
They're still going on.

00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:09,601
And maybe you'll get some folks who are like minded about that.

00:19:09,601 --> 00:19:10,601
There's also a lady called she's from Argo AI.

00:19:10,601 --> 00:19:11,601
And I remember her having some seriously good thoughts about how to do what you were asking.

00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:12,601
Any other questions?

00:19:12,601 --> 00:19:13,601
Okay.

00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,601
AUDIENCE: What kind of feedback have you gotten on your message from managers and executives?

00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:18,980
How do they feel about tech as debt and people are gold?

00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:27,140
DAVE: So, managers and executives, they agree that they don't care about tech debt.

00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,210
They're often not so good about realizing that people are gold.

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,539
But I've heard so many poem tell me tales of woe trying to convince their execs that

00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:38,960
they need to spend way more time paying down tech debt.

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,539
Don't care.

00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,640
Ship some City shit.

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:50,190
I think you can have better conversation it is you talk more about delivering for users,

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,230
delivering on products and services and increasing the value of the product.

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:59,440
And then, you know, coming back to risk calculations, and I don't know the answer exactly.

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,110
But looking at what point does tech debt hurt the delivery of value?

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:08,200
It may not be immediately or in a way that matters.

00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,059
So, weaving tech debt into a conversation with execs that speaks to what they care about.

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,429
Shipping product and making money.

00:20:16,429 --> 00:20:18,330
Same is true about worrying about people.

00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:25,890
Make how are it's relevant to them, retention is good because retraining is expensive.

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:33,960
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank you.

00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,290
First of all, great talk.

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:41,500
So, you've talked about moving stuff to open source or finding SaaS solutions.

00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,880
Which makes sense in isolation.

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,480
But I wonder, like, down the road, am I putting myself out of a job?

00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,309
Like, what's left?

00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:50,730
Do we have any tech?

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,030
DAVE: Yes, you are.

00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,059
And that's the goal.

00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:58,880
There was a talk I think it was in this room, someone had a great quote of hire people who

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,390
will automate themselves out of a job and then give them more jobs.

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:10,150
So, you know, if someone else can deliver that thing for a fee and do it fast and reliable,

00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,000
you're gonna be out of a job of that thing.

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,020
Regardless Put yourself out that have job.

00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,370
Show your value to the company.

00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:16,810
Move on to the next thing.

00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:21,769
No one at this industry is at any risk of not having job opportunities.

00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:24,090
>> Okay.

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:33,389
And one last round?

00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:35,710
Anybody?

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,340
One you have up there.

00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,340
Oh, that's me.

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:46,059
AUDIENCE: So, at what point are you willing to deploy out a fair amount of tech debt?

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:52,330
Sorry, I tried to formulate it.

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:59,130
Part of it, from what I'm understanding is, you're trying to get to the market faster.

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:07,039
So, I guess at what point do you accept the debt that you have and then deem it worth

00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:11,380
to go out versus going back and actually shaving off some of the debt?

00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,399
DAVE: Oh, I have an easy answer for you.

00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,559
As soon as you possibly flip and ship it.

00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:16,559
Do so.

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:22,100
The value of your tech only gets worse over time.

00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,110
The value of product market fit is priceless.

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:31,169
So, anything that you can get to your user and prove out that they want this thing, that

00:22:31,169 --> 00:22:32,649
is valuable.

00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:40,450
And if you can hold up if it is roadway liable enough just barely for them not to sue you,

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,190
that's success.

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,179
[ Laughter ] Grow the business.

00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:48,640
Find a customer that wants what you are able it give them.

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,950
Then worry about that reliability.

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:54,590
One thing, a slide that I sometimes present in this topic is the Twitter fail whale.

00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,050
And I put that up and I say, oh, my god, that is so beautiful.

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,100
From a product perspective, that means people wanted that thing.

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,480
And, like, Twitter is still around.

00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,500
For every one of those there's, you know, a dozen companies, over productionalized and,

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,750
over optimized and never got off the ground.

00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:15,750
>> cool.

00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,230
Once again, thank you, Dave.

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:19,970
