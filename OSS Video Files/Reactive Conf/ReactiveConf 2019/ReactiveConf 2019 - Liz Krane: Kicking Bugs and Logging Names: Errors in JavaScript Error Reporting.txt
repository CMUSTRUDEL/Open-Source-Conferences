How can we extract the most value from our front-end JavaScript errors, especially when users often don’t report them?

We’ll learn about the evolution of the browser’s global error event handler and how to work around its limitations — cross-browser idiosyncrasies, stack traces as unwieldy strings, minified code, and other fun stuff that we really look forward to dealing with! We’ll also look at libraries to make JavaScript stack traces more useful, along with other techniques for making our bugs a little less buggy.
