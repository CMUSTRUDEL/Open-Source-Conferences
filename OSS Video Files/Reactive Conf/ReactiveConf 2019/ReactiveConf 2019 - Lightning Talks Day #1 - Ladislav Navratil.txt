00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,670
hello everyone how you doing

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,160
I hope that you are enjoying the

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,990
conference my name is Ladislav Navratil

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,189
and today I would like to introduce you

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:34,020
my new project unlimite bella pers

00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:37,020
designers and product managers can

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,840
collaborate together it gives you

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,570
instant preview of your project for all

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,730
your team when you want normally when

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,860
you want to show your progress on your

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,289
project to someone you have to build it

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,940
you have to deploy it somewhere and you

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,430
have to notify the user that you have

00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,680
new version usually you trying to

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,649
ultimately say this kind of things but

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,840
still you have to maintain it and you

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,860
know you don't need to do it with

00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,770
unlimited all automatically right above

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:11,790
your gate without any pre-built and any

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:15,000
deployments so how does it work you can

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:18,540
take any your existing project and just

00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,530
drag and drop it to the unlimited of the

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:25,049
box without any special setup an analyze

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,640
your project understand what it needs

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:28,470
what kind of development tools

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,770
what kind of dependencies and install it

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:34,829
for you on the background donor also its

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,930
adding the unnamed tooling

00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:40,650
don't worry it doesn't touch your code

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:46,619
too much and it lays next to it and just

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:49,920
extend it so after you and all the users

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:53,820
which you invited you receiving the live

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,430
preview of your application and because

00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,149
it lays above your gate you can even

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:04,500
travel back in time and be notified when

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,299
there is something new to check it also

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,580
understands your media marks in your

00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,590
project and showing you that your

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,450
application behaves differently on

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,740
different devices so you can

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,720
interactively

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:20,550
how does it look it's all if it's

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,200
alright it also bringing the

00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,390
presentation mode so if you want to show

00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,040
your project to someone else you can do

00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:31,170
it in this presentation mode to like

00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:33,600
bring bigger impact to it but most of

00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,670
all it's called elaborating tool so the

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,180
designers and product managers can

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:42,420
review it and write the comments like

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:47,330
what should be changed and it can even

00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:52,350
create the issues in the github for you

00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:54,300
and it's also tracking the issue so if

00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:57,180
someone comments it or just making the

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,100
work done you are getting notification

00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,230
that this is done and you should review

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:06,360
it again if it's if it's alright he's

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:09,180
doing all automatically and it's not

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,590
ending here there is more there are some

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,870
features which I would like to show you

00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:17,700
which will be public a little bit later

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:20,250
after the after the launch one of them

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,120
you can select any component in your

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:26,150
project because unlined recognized the

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,400
components and show you the name

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,260
description its preview it's showing you

00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,510
all the api's what you can do with the

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,910
component all the internal states of the

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,480
component and where the component in

00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:41,700
your application is used it's also

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,670
creating component library for you so

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:49,500
you can see all components what using in

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:53,760
your product the same thing it's doing

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,640
with the styles it's creating automatic

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,680
style guidelines for you so the designer

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,810
can come and check if all the styles are

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,630
correct and don't forget this is above

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:05,250
life project is not in the in the tools

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,460
like Zeppelin and so on were you working

00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,620
above the graphic and right now we

00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:13,550
forget even more crazy because of the

00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:18,030
unnamed tooling you can even change the

00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:19,560
styles and see what will how it will

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,600
happen in the real life in the

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,970
application overview so you can change

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,040
things like Styles text and another

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,210
things and see immediately so this

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,210
orange color it's out

00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:38,460
so this is unknown let me a little bit

00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:41,900
summarize it and wrap it up unlimited

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,760
you of your application within your team

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,040
it works out of the box with your

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,620
existing project

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:53,040
it creates component library and style

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,590
guides in one place and last but not

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,710
least it lets you collaborate together

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:02,640
to create the best product possible so

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:05,550
please visit Allen dot IO we're

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:08,640
launching soon so subscribe to stays to

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,200
keep updated and let us know it will be

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,030
amazing it will be the first people who

00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,270
looked right and let us make this

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:19,110
product even better thank you so much

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:19,110
[Applause]

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,160
thank you loud yeah I don't leave yet

00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,950
because we do have questions for you so

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,530
what technology stacks are supported by

00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,840
um LEM great question we're starting

00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,910
with react but another natural

00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,820
technologies will come after that we for

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:39,120
sure counting with UJS and most probably

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,590
with angular we trying to focus also for

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,240
mobile applications but it will be a

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:47,070
little bit harder but I think that one

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,990
will succeed is it running on Chrome or

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,220
something else no it's a native

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:55,140
application so basically built on the

00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,590
electron but it's a native application

00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,660
in your in your computer how does it

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,770
work with secrets and other required APA

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,900
credentials I don't know which I beg

00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:08,760
pretentious basically application have

00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,290
it inside when you have it built in the

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,210
configuration for a project in the gate

00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:14,970
is there if you have something of pre

00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:19,380
building we don't support it yet good

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:22,080
good point maybe Ken unly met with

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,450
online repos and update automatically

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,350
when repo is updated yes this is the

00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:31,850
main thing what it does that was a

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:34,170
question is it free we don't know yet

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,030
this will be a little bit what so we

00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:38,700
have to figure out its fill for sure be

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,720
in some free version but we will search

00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,790
for the

00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,770
model basically business model behind it

00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:45,810
most probably in some collaborative way

00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,910
over the bigger for the bigger teams but

00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,650
it will it will come free on the

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:52,830
beginning for sure and it will stay free

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:57,330
for some limited usage last question

00:06:52,830 --> 00:07:01,500
what about REST API which one is it

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:04,860
what about REST API is the last one it's

00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,720
on the table yes yep it it works with

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,980
them like it's how we program it right

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,860
it's gonna break the graphical arrests

00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:14,190
whatever it's not something something

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,570
together I would say all right thank you

00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,490
so much while you I believe you're gonna

00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,650
speak tomorrow again correct Friday
