okay nice excited to be here glad

00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,450
looking forward to talking to all you

00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,669
about Gatsby

00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:30,300
so first show of hand who here has heard

00:00:26,669 --> 00:00:32,759
of Gatsby before okay it's a solid

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,910
majority who here is used it in some

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:41,420
fashion another cool it's about half of

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,420
people awesome so um let's jump in

00:00:42,949 --> 00:00:48,960
okay so first the kind of basic

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,820
definition Gatsby is a free and

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,160
open-source web framework based on react

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:57,530
that helps developers build blazing-fast

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,940
websites and apps and our goal is that

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,070
you can approach building you know

00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,600
whatever you wanted to use built with

00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:08,100
react on the web with confidence and

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,570
kind of the idea is you know reacts when

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,730
it was introduced was famously like hey

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,860
we're just a view and largely speaking

00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:16,020
that's true like it's a incredible

00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,270
library but you know the number of

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,400
concerns that react covers is relatively

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,200
small and Gatsby's goal is to kind of

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,950
help you with everything else need to

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,930
build a great website or app for the web

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,730
it's a bit about me so I'm the founder

00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,030
of the Gatsby open source project and

00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:35,790
also Gatsby is now a company and so I'm

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,520
the CEO there and my background is

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:40,440
pretty CCMS heavy I build a lot of sites

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,830
with Drupal is like a freelancer in the

00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,600
2000s and then kind of 2010's I worked

00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:49,110
at Pantheon a start-up in San Francisco

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:54,150
on a Drupal WordPress kind of developer

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:57,030
tools hosting company and after doing a

00:01:54,150 --> 00:02:00,060
lot of CMS stuff a lot of kind of ID law

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,220
backbone jQuery exedra back in the day I

00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,350
got into react and I wanted to start

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:06,150
Gatsby because I fell in love with the

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,710
react and I wanted to have a simple way

00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:09,390
to take react and the kind of the

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:12,660
paradigm I love there and use it to

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:14,340
build websites and I open source that

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,350
and now four years later there's tens of

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,480
thousands of you know sites and apps

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,930
built with Gatsby and a really thriving

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,640
ecosystem of contributors

00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,560
so you know there's a number sites

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,680
you've probably seen that building got

00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,990
to be including the react Docs also like

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,280
impossible foods and a bunch of other

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,770
sites you can check them out at the

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,250
showcase and give you start with got to

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,670
be super simple it's three steps install

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,860
the CLI and then you do Gatsby new to

00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,940
create a new site and there's kind of a

00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,500
default starter and then there's

00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,910
hundreds of starters that the community

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,590
has created

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,790
it's got to be can be used for all sorts

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:54,320
of different things like e-commerce

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:58,500
blogs portfolio sites marketing sites

00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:59,880
almost anything you can imagine and yeah

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,980
and then there's a developer server got

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:07,910
to be developed so let's actually jump

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:18,739
in and see what it's like so go to a

00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:18,739
command line and so that's odd

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,800
yeah I ran get clean that was missing

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,030
okay

00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,170
luckily the the way the conference Wi-Fi

00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:44,920
is pretty fasts okay so start the got to

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,380
be developed command and it goes through

00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,590
the bootstrap process it starts webpack

00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:59,170
dev server you make a little bit bigger

00:03:50,590 --> 00:04:01,300
still okay and then we have a blog very

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,630
nice so this is the this is the official

00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:08,650
blog starter by the way okay so this is

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:11,200
a react app run by Gatsby and I can

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:15,040
click around it has pages these pages

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,450
are created from markdown files so if

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,790
you kind of look at all that was too

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:24,580
much so these are all in like the

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:29,590
content folder so content blog if we

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:31,950
open up our editor I make this bigger

00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,950
too

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:44,020
so if we open up then this one okay if

00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:46,479
we open up our editor to you know new

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:49,720
beginnings you can see the same markdown

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,380
file say new beginnings in Prague you

00:04:49,720 --> 00:05:00,520
can save it hot reloads you change the

00:04:53,380 --> 00:05:02,800
date to you know today happy Halloween

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,540
voila come change it up there so you get

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,100
a hot reloading for I'm can one of the

00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:09,750
goals they've got to be as is hot

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,750
reloading is good everything hot reloads

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:16,810
so this is a markdown file you can go to

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:22,770
other markdown files and then I clover

00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:28,380
or actually you know so this be the

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:34,650
world hello world you're great

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:38,020
except yeah I think there he goes

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:40,270
so Gatsby has the idea of there's

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,030
there's two ways to kind of add pages

00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,710
there's kind of like standalone pages so

00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,449
like the home page

00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:54,190
here is driven by this react component

00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:58,030
and then each of the blog post pages are

00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:01,449
a template component like this so if we

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:06,940
go here to the title and we're like you

00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:09,550
know the title say that you know then it

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:15,160
updates the template you know for all

00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:19,150
the different blog posts like so yeah

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:22,419
and so gatsby it uses react obviously

00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:24,669
and it also uses graph QL to kind of

00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:27,160
fetch the data that's needed for all

00:06:24,669 --> 00:06:28,389
these pages and so you can use that you

00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,550
can fetch data from all sorts of places

00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:31,810
so this site uses markdown but Gatsby

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,280
supports like hundreds of different

00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,490
sources like basically anything with the

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,870
API you can pull and data from and the

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,570
Gatsby community has created a bunch of

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,990
source plugins to do this which all used

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:46,419
kind of Gatsby's graphical layer so this

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:48,760
is like the graphical query for the blog

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,460
post template so kind of a simple thing

00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,500
you can do is you know this fetches the

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,539
date from the markdown field and then

00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,659
you can like format the date so if we

00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:03,220
change that for example then it modified

00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:06,760
is how we are rendering the year I think

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:14,080
so and if you use graph QL you've

00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:19,270
probably seen the graphic yuo which is

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,400
the the built-in graph QL IDE and that

00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,800
we include that with gasps because it's

00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,060
super useful for kind of working you

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,130
know figuring out which query you need

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,229
so a typical pattern is and you're like

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,720
I need a new page and then you play

00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:33,610
around in graphic UL to figure out what

00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,949
the query you need and then you create

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,870
the page and so gatsby tries to make

00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:39,940
that really simple so over here you can

00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:43,090
see all the different kind of types that

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:45,550
are included and each each each each

00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:47,800
type has sort of a collection a way of

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:49,870
clearing the whole collection so for

00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,599
example if you wanted to query every

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:55,180
markdown file you could click on all

00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,910
markdown remark and then you click on

00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:58,490
notes

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:06,040
and then you're like I want to get the

00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:09,350
excerpts and frontmatter title and then

00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:12,770
time to read and then you come over here

00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:14,540
and you click the run and then that

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,820
returns the data so you can see like my

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:19,280
second pose new beginnings in Prague etc

00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,260
etc and this is all live so it's like we

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,410
change and if you change the markdown

00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:27,830
then the query or whatever and then

00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,880
we've included this code exporter so you

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:32,840
know you want to create a new page

00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:36,830
that's showing these you just copy this

00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:40,190
generated page query and then what you

00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:44,510
can do is you want to say let's say you

00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:47,270
want to go my new page and then Gatsby

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,070
will say oh hey there's no no pages oh

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,080
yeah but it tells you how to create it

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,260
so if you create a react component at

00:08:51,080 --> 00:09:04,820
source pages my new page then this will

00:08:54,260 --> 00:09:14,900
show it so we can go pages my new page

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:19,460
yes and then we just save this and okay

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:23,290
there you go and then you know you can

00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,290
like start modifying this you like

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:39,370
my blog post cetera and then let's say

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:45,010
you wanted to link this from the home

00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:47,050
page so you go back here go here and so

00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,519
Gatsby includes a link component which

00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,940
is already imported on the index

00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:58,959
component from Gatsby and so just after

00:09:51,940 --> 00:10:11,100
the bio for example you do link to link

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:14,019
to that page my new page and then and

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:23,320
then voila you've added a new page to

00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:25,420
your site kill second yeah so earlier I

00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:27,820
said you know if react is just a view

00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,320
Gatsby is everything else so what is the

00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:32,980
everything else that got to be as

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,260
wrecked yes and the first thing is you

00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:36,730
know to build you know to actually take

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:38,139
your react components and like build

00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,389
them into a form that you can deploy

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:42,399
somewhere you need a bundler you need

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,740
transpire you probably support for

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,510
typescript support for CS options a

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,430
bunch of other stuff and gatsby provides

00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,139
you know all these by default we have

00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:52,540
like a kind of a really bulletproof

00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:54,490
config that the vast majority of sites

00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,410
used and that we've extensively tested

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,810
you know so that's like as reliable

00:10:56,410 --> 00:11:01,449
robust as fast as possible cetera and

00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:02,860
then as you probably know web pack has a

00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,319
you know a bunch of different ways of

00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:08,170
modifying it and we've wrapped all these

00:11:05,319 --> 00:11:10,829
in Gatsby plugins which there's now 1400

00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:13,389
of them so that almost any imaginable

00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:14,889
type of modification you want to make to

00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:17,380
your build setup you just install the

00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:18,940
plug-in and off you go

00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:24,490
another great thing about Gatsby is

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,199
hosting is really simple what Gatsby you

00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:29,139
know gatsby sites don't require servers

00:11:26,199 --> 00:11:30,850
to run them which means that instead of

00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:32,649
like having to provision instead of a

00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:35,350
bunch of sites you can just use a kind

00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:37,480
of a static hosting provider like a CDN

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,370
and run it for a fraction of cost of

00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,650
runtime assess our site

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,230
which is great because you know CDNs are

00:11:41,650 --> 00:11:46,990
that's their whole job is to serve lots

00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,850
of you know files really fast and so

00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,100
when your entire sites on a CDN it

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:53,980
solves a whole bunch of problems around

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,410
running your site so in general you know

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,280
we say you should prefer kind of like

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:02,410
serverless solutions like gatsby does

00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:05,200
where you kind of pre render your react

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:09,490
up versus runtime SSR which is much more

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,770
complex and costly kind of a simple

00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,680
example of this is Harry's comm which is

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:17,170
a shaver branch site they launched a new

00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,120
women's brand and on launch day they

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:20,620
built their new site with gatsby and a

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,630
launch day they got 10x their normal

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,420
traffic and there and then they told us

00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,860
that they were you know nervous like oh

00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,660
like anything gonna break something

00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,040
gonna happen whatever and they didn't

00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,010
have to do anything they had it on

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:36,130
fastly and the site scaled without any

00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,490
problems and it was really kind of

00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,150
peaceful

00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:43,380
they just got silly just be excited and

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:46,480
I watch it nothing gets me covers is SEO

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:51,850
so as you probably know react you know

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:55,180
purely client-side apps have Google and

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:57,760
others have trouble parsing those and so

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,260
gatsby SSRS pages at build time so that

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,620
your site is indexed you know as

00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:08,470
expected now the great thing got to be

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:10,870
does is loading data is kind of

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,500
surprising to me that yeah just like how

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:17,290
much time just getting data onto a page

00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:19,840
can take it's a remarkably complex

00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,090
problem and gatsby goes to great lengths

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,170
to kind of automate that and so as we

00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,620
saw earlier with like kind of the graph

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,420
Coulier and you can hook up plug-ins for

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:31,000
almost any sort of data source to pull

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:34,090
in data and then gatsby automates

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,650
loading that into the page and so with a

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:37,270
data layer you have essentially no

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,430
boilerplate where you just have your

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:43,530
component and then your query and then

00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:45,640
we handle loading it in when it's needed

00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:50,520
another great thing about Gatsby is

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:52,650
performance is baked in so

00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:56,220
performance is like a whole bunch of

00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,960
little things to to get right stuff like

00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,970
code splitting image optimizations

00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,650
inlining critical styles lazy loading

00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,760
prefetching eccentric cetera et cetera

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:07,140
and we spend a ton of time just like

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,320
researching like what are the best

00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,160
practices and finding ways to

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,170
automatically make that happen within

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,120
gatsby so that all you have to do is

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,810
like react components and then will take

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,400
care of making sure that that's fast

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:23,070
without manual tuning which a lot of

00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,280
systems require so kind of a quick demo

00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:34,170
this like if you go to got to be jeaious

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:35,820
tied org and then if you load up the

00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:39,450
network tab so I talked about like

00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:42,920
prefetching for example and like loading

00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:45,620
data so one thing that got suite does is

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:48,990
you know as you kind of like start

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,090
rolling so when these kind of like links

00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:53,700
come up we start pre fetching the data

00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:56,010
needed for them so now when you like

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,410
click on this for example everything

00:14:56,010 --> 00:15:02,480
needed to render that page is already in

00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:04,710
the client because we prefetch them so

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,370
kind of show that again as we scroll

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:12,650
down and start to get in here some links

00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:15,840
you know we pulling these page data for

00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:18,690
you know like page data ecosystem click

00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:20,340
on that you know instantly renders the

00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,490
new page because the data and the code

00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,440
has already been pre fetched and so by

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:26,760
taking like your entire site and then

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,530
like kind of like breaking up into

00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,480
little chunks and makes sure that you

00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:32,070
know you're never loading too much when

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,350
the page first loads but by

00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,290
intelligently prefetching as soon as you

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:44,400
want to go to a link you know your user

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:48,210
isn't waiting for that to happen okay so

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:51,450
how does Gatsby happen it's not just me

00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:53,580
sneak peek so two years ago so I started

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,370
the project 4 years ago and open sourced

00:15:53,580 --> 00:16:00,000
it and was really gratified by just the

00:15:56,370 --> 00:16:01,360
really strong interest from you know

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,910
react developers all around the world

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,029
and I knew that like I've done open

00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:09,069
source for a long time and you know

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:10,420
those of you who participate heavily an

00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:12,670
open source you know it can be sometimes

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,869
a thankless task like you you know you

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:15,189
have your job and then you have your

00:16:13,869 --> 00:16:17,290
other job you know maintaining your open

00:16:15,189 --> 00:16:19,299
source project and I knew that Gatsby

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,009
had the potential to be like a really

00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:22,179
massive project and I knew it wasn't

00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:24,999
something I could do by myself

00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:26,649
and so I wanted to make sure that Gatsby

00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:28,839
had like a strong kind of like business

00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:30,489
model behind it so that both myself and

00:16:28,839 --> 00:16:32,350
other people that would you know be

00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,029
needed to to kind of work on the project

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,110
would have salaries to like work

00:16:34,029 --> 00:16:36,970
full-time on it it wasn't like a

00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:38,290
part-time thing yeah because I think you

00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:40,899
know great great open-source software

00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:43,179
requires a lot of dedicated time to make

00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,279
happen and so my co-founder Sam Bhagwan

00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:48,970
and I we a couple years ago we started

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:51,999
found that our started a startup founded

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,249
to startup to to help grow Gatsby and we

00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:55,779
raise money in order to do that so so

00:16:54,249 --> 00:16:58,209
far we've raised eighteen point seven

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:01,029
million from a few different VC firms

00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:03,100
and there's now 40 full-time got some

00:17:01,029 --> 00:17:07,149
employees with 15 of those working

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:08,529
full-time on OSS and we're seeking to

00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:10,269
model ourselves after there's been a

00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:11,799
number of great OSS companies emerged

00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:13,419
over the last few years like elastic

00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,019
confluent hashey Corp and a bunch of

00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:20,289
others and what they've done is you know

00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:23,980
married building an amazing inclusive

00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:26,500
OSS ecosystem and providing also like

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:30,220
cloud services with lots of customers to

00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,200
kind of like fund the whole thing and

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,570
our goal is that you know with the

00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,970
community that everyone feels like they

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:40,240
belong that you know it's a you know we

00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:41,980
we go to great lengths to provide great

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,210
documentation so like anybody can get

00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:50,139
started with gatsby and we also you know

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:53,590
try to you know enforce code of conducts

00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:56,139
we have come into accessibility and do a

00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:58,510
lot of things so that people can get

00:17:56,139 --> 00:18:03,370
started with gatsby can contribute and

00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:05,049
feel safe and you have been really

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:06,639
gratified to see all the people that you

00:18:05,049 --> 00:18:12,070
have gotten involved and made great

00:18:06,639 --> 00:18:14,700
contributions yeah and so I kind of

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,489
recover that so we're investing

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,049
a lot of money to grow Gatsby and we

00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:21,359
think that like the this marriage

00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:23,519
between OSS and commercial can create

00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,700
kind of like a virtuous cycle that you

00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,129
know the the revenue from the business

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,559
can fund development and then kind of

00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:34,049
the things that we learn through through

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,029
you know participation OSS community I

00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:41,970
can feed a lot of what we're doing with

00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:44,369
the company and that these can really

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,409
complement a few each other so a common

00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:48,090
question I get asked is like well ok so

00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,649
your business like how does that

00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:51,869
actually work like how do you make money

00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:53,249
what's your business model and the

00:18:51,869 --> 00:18:54,840
answer is basically you know cloud

00:18:53,249 --> 00:18:57,090
infrastructure and collaboration tools

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,009
so this is very similar in a lot of ways

00:18:57,090 --> 00:19:01,799
what we're doing to like site or notify

00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:06,570
Heroku AWS you've kind of other like

00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:10,830
cloud technology providers but

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:13,909
specifically for gatsby and you know

00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:16,200
we're in process of launching stuff but

00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:18,389
we'll have like a generous free tier for

00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,919
everyone to use and you know for

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:22,679
experimentation small sites and then

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,210
charge commercial users as they kind of

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,059
scale up their usage of the cloud tools

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,549
and so our first product has been out in

00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,359
open beta for a few months

00:19:29,549 --> 00:19:35,009
it's called CMS preview and this is

00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,590
basically content hot reloading for

00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:39,239
content authors and marketers so if you

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,119
know how useful it is like while you're

00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:45,809
developing code to see hot reloading the

00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,950
same thing is true of you know for

00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,230
content authors because like if you're

00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,700
editing like a con a complex data model

00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,950
it's nice to see how it's gonna affect

00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:56,600
the site so let me give a quick demo of

00:19:52,950 --> 00:20:00,419
that so this is our dashboard here and

00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:04,109
so you can open up hopefully this is

00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:06,200
working okay so I need to do this real

00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:06,200
quick

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:19,040
too many tubes there's okay so if you

00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:24,410
like you edit the title for example is

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,880
this going okay it's working and prog so

00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:29,270
yeah so imagine you're a content editor

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,920
and you're just going around the site

00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:35,530
and you're like okay I want to edit a

00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:37,810
project not at the London gets me Meetup

00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:46,910
[Music]

00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:53,060
it's reactive dude calm and then you can

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:58,850
say upload a different images just

00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:59,360
screenshots you know say so it's like

00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:04,060
huh

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,060
kind of like live reloading as you go

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:09,830
yeah and so we have like 60 of customers

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:12,590
now so people using gatsby sites and

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:15,680
they want to give their you know kind of

00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:25,790
CMS authors a great experience I guess

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:30,370
includes that and then we're also

00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:32,510
working to solve kind of build time

00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,460
built time for sites or building sites

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,820
and particularly around how to make

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:39,890
gatsby scale to very large sites and if

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:41,810
you've used Gatsby particularly for you

00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:43,720
know thousand sites with thousands of

00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,950
pages like built times can get slow and

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,600
what this means is that it can both be

00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,880
like annoying to use if your site's

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,500
larger but also maybe just like

00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,000
straight-up impossible like you know if

00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,160
you have a site that has say a hundred

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,290
thousand pages it's just not possible to

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,570
kind of like pre-render that entire site

00:21:57,290 --> 00:22:02,900
in any reasonable amount of time but

00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,820
we're working to solve that and this is

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,020
super hard problem it's kind of a lot of

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,030
people say it's like the holy grail of

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,640
static sites but we're feeling pretty

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:14,600
confident we've cracked it the basic

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:16,160
idea is you know gatsby like all built

00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,190
processes you have like a bunch of work

00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:20,480
and you do it sequentially and the idea

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,370
of what we're doing what we're building

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,900
in our and our cloud product is

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,520
we take that build process and kind of

00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:28,220
like split it apart and run it across

00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,450
hundreds of servers so you know this

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,980
sort of illustration of the difference

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,780
between like a normal build and a cloud

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,400
build is your normal build

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:37,310
it's like sequential step by step by

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,290
step and then a cloud build we paralyze

00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,450
stuff immediately and then in subsequent

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:42,830
builds we can like eliminate doing a lot

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,420
of kind of like repetitive work because

00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,700
like we'll have a really fine green

00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,040
caching so that we only have to do the

00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,340
build steps that are necessary which is

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,990
like leads to a dramatic speed-up and

00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,850
this will be part of will be like a

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:57,950
hosted service you know running on our

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:00,940
cloud infrastructure and we'll be

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:03,050
launching this in the coming months and

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:07,580
it's gonna be pretty amazing we think

00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:13,400
that yeah well you even very large sites

00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:14,870
will rebuild very quickly yeah in

00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,060
summary it's like what we're trying to

00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,710
do in general got to begin is you know

00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,750
help you build you know help you take

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,120
react like kind of the paradigm of react

00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,070
and use it to build any sort of you know

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,330
web property with confidence you know

00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,430
whether that's like kind of traditional

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,890
CMS type websites or like you know

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:34,850
really sophisticated apps you know

00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:36,530
gatsby has all the reacts kind of you

00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,710
know everything you need around react to

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:42,350
make that happen and particularly you

00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:44,300
know we're bringing react to the CMS

00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,470
world because you know see most people

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,810
are still using like WordPress and

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:49,040
Drupal and and and hundreds of other

00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:52,580
different you know different types of

00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:56,420
CMS's and gatsby lets you use react with

00:23:52,580 --> 00:24:01,490
those CMS bolt them into the modern app

00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:04,400
world and yeah so invite you to come

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,740
build your site's with got to be thanks

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,559
for having me

00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:13,230
[Applause]

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,110
don't go anywhere because a one tile

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,700
that you guys are not gonna ask them any

00:24:16,110 --> 00:24:19,260
questions since he's the first speaker

00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,700
and you probably are a little tired so

00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:23,789
but that's not true there's so many of

00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,559
them so could Getz be include typescript

00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:28,260
support by default that's the first

00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,870
question yeah so that's something that's

00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:33,029
requested a lot so right now gatsby has

00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:35,330
a plug-in for typescript but a lot of

00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:38,669
people want it built out of the box and

00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:40,409
yeah one of our you know one of the core

00:24:38,669 --> 00:24:41,519
maintainers is working on an issue to

00:24:40,409 --> 00:24:45,059
kind of gather the requirements for that

00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:47,309
and it's something yeah we could ship

00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:49,289
pretty soon actually how gates be

00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:52,760
decides how to split code and when lazy

00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:55,799
load bundles yeah so we ship by default

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,620
page are kind of routes based code

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,389
splitting so every like type of page you

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,700
know like you know a single page or like

00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:06,510
or like a template page gets its own

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,799
bundle and and so those those so that

00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:09,539
that generally takes care of a lot of

00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:10,880
performance problems it kind of like ice

00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:13,889
so if you have like a really big

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,450
JavaScript template and like one of your

00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:17,130
sub pages you know that code that you

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:21,360
need there is only loaded if you visit

00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:22,799
that page and you can also do code

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,659
splitting like within your page

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,549
component if if you want to like lazy

00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,350
load like a big widget or something that

00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:30,269
most people don't need does the

00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:33,809
prefetching automatically turn off for

00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:37,049
mobile or IA it always on data is not

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:40,260
always cheap yes this is a great point

00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:41,610
so we try to be as conservative as

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,370
possible we'll still drive any great

00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:46,590
experience our main solution for this is

00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:48,840
that most browsers support like was like

00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:51,630
a data saver mode and so we respect that

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:53,940
so if somebody doesn't want to use extra

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,919
data then we don't we turn down

00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:59,309
prefetching a lot but as you saw in the

00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,710
performance demo - we only prefetch when

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,480
we're pretty confident that somebody is

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,090
going to click on the link so generally

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,840
speaking we're not loading a lot of data

00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:12,750
how about gets being micro-services we

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,860
support it so got to be you know fits

00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,799
very well and kind of like the

00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,039
serverless micro-services paradigm where

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,620
you have you know a client app that's

00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,300
talking into different back-end API

00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,550
so a lot of people use it very

00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,500
successfully I mean are you know on

00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:29,450
Gatsby Jess calm like this is how we're

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,150
building everything with micro-services

00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:33,770
we go to two last questions can you use

00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,100
gets filled with rest for dynamic pages

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:41,000
with all the advantages like prefetching

00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:42,830
yep absolutely so you know Gatsby's data

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,970
layer it's it's pretty straightforward

00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:50,420
to hook it up to any sorts of API and

00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:52,820
you can trigger building your pages with

00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,890
that and what are your plans for the new

00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:59,770
features and feature development of

00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:03,770
Gatsby we have tons of plans

00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:05,480
so yeah I mean we have we have a big

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,970
team working on stuff so a lot of our

00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,620
focus is just in general like improving

00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,500
the developer experience you know

00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,240
helping scale up Gatsby builds making

00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,630
your site's faster and faster so we have

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,010
a lot of optimizations coming and what's

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,240
cool about what we're doing is that you

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:23,510
know all of this is like we're shipping

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,770
within you know we've been on like d2

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:27,290
for the last year and we just keep

00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:29,570
shipping new improvements so kind of the

00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:31,160
overall goal is that you know you start

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,679
building your site with Gatsby and then

00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,559
we'll just make it faster and better as

00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,990
time goes on well that's all the time we

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,750
had for the questions right now but I

00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:44,030
will be today at 5 p.m. at the discover

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:46,160
stage as a part of our chat zone so you

00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,380
can ask some questions there directly

00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,490
thank you so much so this was Kyle

00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,960
Matthews again
