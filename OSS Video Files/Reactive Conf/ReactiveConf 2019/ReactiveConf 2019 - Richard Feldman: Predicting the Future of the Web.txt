The Web has changed a lot since its beginning as a platform for static articles. At first, Web applications did not exist. Then they began to appear in the form of servers generating HTML on the fly. PHP was huge, then fell by the wayside as JS rose. Flash came and went. Today, the Web has become the biggest application delivery platform in history and based on its past, the one thing we can be certain of is that more changes are yet to come.

What, specifically, might those changes be? What differences might the Web of 2020 have to the the Web of 2019? What about the Web of 2025? What would the impact be on Web developers? In this talk, Richard draws on his 12 years of professional Web development experience, and history of being an early adopter of technologies like React in 2013 and Elm in 2014, to make and justify some concrete predictions about the future of the Web in both 2020 and 2025.
