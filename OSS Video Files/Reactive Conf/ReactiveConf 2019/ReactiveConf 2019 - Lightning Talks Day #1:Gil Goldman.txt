00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,130
so first off thank you very much but

00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:22,660
Leena for that wonderful introduction

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,250
give it up again to probably enough

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:29,680
she's doing amazing work here on this

00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:31,950
stage wonderful work and thank you very

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,950
much

00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,850
basically I'm here to pitch to you an

00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:44,020
idea but let's start with a story it's

00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:46,390
hot it's humid you are in an undisclosed

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,660
location in one of the most top-secret

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:52,329
facilities in the world you're inside a

00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:55,120
simulation and you're learning how to

00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:57,670
operate the tank you can feel the sand

00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,129
you can smell the grease and you turn a

00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:08,520
corner in your simulated tank and

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,520
something's not exactly right

00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:17,189
something feels a bit off something

00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:20,530
doesn't really sit together in your

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,119
perfect simulation super accurate world

00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:26,200
in which you are supposed to learn how

00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:29,049
to drive a tank something's weird so

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,570
when we looked at this we consider

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:33,729
enormous scales as a terrible failure I

00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,560
mean look at it it's enormous huge this

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:40,719
is not a cow this is not to scale what's

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:42,490
up here so we were embarrassed this is a

00:01:40,719 --> 00:01:47,350
failure for us of developers but the

00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:49,210
soldiers loved it to them this was

00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:51,280
wonderful they laughed at this so much

00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,869
they remembered it for weeks later they

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,740
remember the simple calm straining

00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:59,170
they've done because of the giant cows

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,740
this ridiculous they loved it we saw it

00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:05,079
as a failure they loved it

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,820
basically my name is Gil Goldman now I'm

00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,340
working with companies and making work

00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,740
more engaging in a bit more fun that

00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:16,840
recently worked at bohemia interactive

00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:19,840
simulations and now socialbakers so I'm

00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,480
here to pitch to you an idea by pouring

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,790
some of yourselves a bit of you into the

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,630
code and into the work you're doing we

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,160
can guarantee

00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:31,750
the product a better working environment

00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,540
and definitely a lot more laughs example

00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,600
number two has to do with this lovely

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:41,170
picture inside one of the world's best

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,930
simulations this came to us from a

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:44,440
customer who shall be anonymous for this

00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,780
chat

00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,910
they've given us an enormous mission

00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:51,640
with thousands of simulated soldiers and

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:54,040
tanks in airplane and naval forces an

00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:56,890
enormous two hour long exercises that

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,590
kept on crashing at the exact same point

00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,100
and we had no idea we've been debugging

00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,690
this for weeks until we finally figured

00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,690
out what happened one of their

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,250
developers wanted to have some fun let's

00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:13,840
make this realistic this is a simulation

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:15,070
after all so they've added rabbits and

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,290
they have little rabbit scampering

00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,090
around running around and one of them

00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,560
was britain had a trajectory plan for it

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,680
to go left and then to go right and then

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,620
climb up a hill and it climbed up a hill

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,380
and it kept climbing and it kept on

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,850
climbing forever and it started flying

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:32,980
it flew all the way to the end of the

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:34,480
simulation reached the top of it the

00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,890
engine looked at it and said well this

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,300
is at the top of simulation this is

00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,860
obviously a soldier dropping from an

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,770
airplane let's open a parachute wait

00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:45,580
this wrap this a parachute everything

00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:48,160
crashed we would have never tested for

00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,050
that nobody in the office and we're all

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:53,230
crazy no one thought about dropping

00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:57,820
bunnies from airplanes but the customers

00:03:53,230 --> 00:04:00,160
did by putting a bit of themselves into

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,220
their code they've made our product

00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,480
better and this is not new everybody has

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,040
been doing this for you some of the best

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,470
and the brightest nASA has been doing

00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:12,720
this this is actual code snippets from

00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:14,740
the Apollo 11 navigation computer

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,910
temporary I hope temporary hope this is

00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:21,660
the final code the temporary I hope it

00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:21,660
off to see the Wizard

00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:29,970
nasa code this made it to the moon and

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:31,590
back and this is not just a long time

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,270
ago this is still being done by some of

00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:36,810
the best and the brightest this is the

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,699
mewing duck of amazon amazon has this in

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,860
their source code you can go there you

00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,940
can find it it's lovely and it's not

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,699
just me saying this

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,580
it's basically science doing things a

00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,930
bit differently and a bit of yourself

00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:50,910
pouring that silliness that is inherent

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,039
to all of us as developers into our code

00:04:50,910 --> 00:05:00,900
makes our work better and some of you

00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:03,770
might still not believe me so all of us

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,770
know this don't we

00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,590
and we all know this because someone at

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,880
Oracle wrote something and left and

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,930
nobody knew what he wrote

00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,610
but everyone remembers him so pour some

00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,550
of yourself into your work to make a

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,090
better product you to make the working

00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,870
environment better and we laugh a bit

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:32,190
thank you

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:36,399
[Applause]

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:36,399
