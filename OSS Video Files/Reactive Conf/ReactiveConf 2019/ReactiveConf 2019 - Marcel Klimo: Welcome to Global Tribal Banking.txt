00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:22,000
hello everyone my name is Marcel wow

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,380
this is loud and I would like to give

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,410
you a sneak peek of what we're building

00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:30,939
at vacuum labs right now and recalling a

00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,890
tribal so but first before I explain why

00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:35,530
it's called tribal let me go back in

00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,380
time if you go back a couple of thousand

00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,530
years we as humans were fundamentally

00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:44,289
tribal the way we communicated was in

00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:47,020
small groups who lived in a small

00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:49,390
location or the same location close to

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,789
each other and we shared our meals

00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,730
shared our days at the end of the day

00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:57,910
around the campfire it was a way to

00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,789
connect to exchange and in a way it was

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:05,110
the beginning of sharing in the terms of

00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:08,050
banking and commerce today the mobile

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,880
phone is the campfire it is a way for us

00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:13,440
to connect with people that share the

00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:17,439
same passions the same jobs the same

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:20,500
interests I can easily find fans of Star

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:23,170
Wars or fans of the same def framework

00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,820
or CSS framework very easily through a

00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:28,899
cell phone which I couldn't do back in

00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,290
the day so we started looking at what's

00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:34,090
the future of banking how do we help

00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,700
groups that are joined through passions

00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:39,520
and joined through interests how do we

00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:42,100
help them live better lives more

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,020
financially responsible lives and get

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,670
the services that they're frankly not

00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,399
getting from the banks insurance

00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:50,920
companies and financial institutions of

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,659
today you see the financial institutions

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:54,969
of today they're built to support

00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:57,909
everybody they're building a mainstream

00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:59,710
product for everyone and doesn't cater

00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,439
to the specific needs of a specific

00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,509
group let me give you an example just a

00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,719
couple of days ago in fact in Las Vegas

00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:10,240
uber announced uber money uber money is

00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:13,390
a way for uber drivers to get a debit

00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:16,360
card which has specific benefits for

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,400
them as drivers meaning they can get an

00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,410
overdraft to pay for the gas that

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,800
they're gonna drive on the whole day

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:25,990
they get specific cash back on that guy

00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,520
and think of specific services that they

00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:31,150
otherwise wouldn't get through your

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,800
normal bank account in a regular bank so

00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:36,160
this is how we see the future of banking

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,140
we see that companies that traditionally

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,870
wouldn't be banks start providing

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,800
financial services and banking products

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,660
to their tribes to their people to the

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,520
people that share the same job or the

00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:55,720
same passion or support the same

00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:58,270
football team whatever so how do how do

00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,890
we actually build this because you can't

00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,050
actually just provide banking and

00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,820
financial services to anyone without the

00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:06,550
license without the proper backing

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,780
without all the risk management so the

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,000
way I look at it is sort of like

00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:13,210
building scaling a mountain you need a

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,170
very strong base that is stable and

00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:15,580
doesn't fall apart

00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,500
and this is exactly the approach that

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,590
uber chose they partnered with an

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,390
existing bank at the base which provides

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,490
the banking account and the core

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,100
services that are needed to be compliant

00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,830
and to work in the end in the market

00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,410
that they're operating in what we want

00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:35,500
to do and where we want to operate is we

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,660
want to be at the core of this so at the

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,690
bottom we're partnering with the network

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:43,900
of banks insurance companies and

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,570
financial services providers so that we

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:50,110
can build a unified core that can then

00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:53,190
build apps and services for specific

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:56,620
niche and tribe tribes of the world

00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,950
recall we're making this as a white

00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,010
label product so the base can look like

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,190
anything it can have the branding of

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,959
Manchester United BMW or it can be eber

00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:11,650
or whatever company that wants to work

00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,420
with us and the name is just tribal so

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,120
if you're interested in working on this

00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,580
technology knowing more about it I will

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,220
be at the vacuum lab stand to talk more

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,489
about it and thank you very much for

00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,489
coming

00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,040
