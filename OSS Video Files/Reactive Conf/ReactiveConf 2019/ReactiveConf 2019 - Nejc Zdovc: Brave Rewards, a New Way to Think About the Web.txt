We all love our privacy as we should. Web and web monetization, today, however, works differently and is reliant on tracking our activities exposing us to the web. Almost all publishers and content creators rely on advertising to monetize their content which inherently relies on tracking to allow them to continue to survive. To allow the web to deliver monetization for Publishers and content creators while keeping users private, we created Brave Rewards. In this talk, Nejc will provide a vision for what a new, private web looks like and how everyone can join in and contribute to the future of the private web together.
