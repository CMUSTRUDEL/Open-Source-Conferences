[Music]

00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,490
it's really great to be here with you

00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,060
guys today I'm going to be talking about

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:27,920
resiliency and progressive web apps now

00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:30,080
resiliency isn't necessarily a new term

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,780
in the world of web development I think

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,790
a lot of us have heard it in the world

00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,000
of DevOps when we talk about how to

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:40,850
prevent downtime or creating robust

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,510
distributed systems but if we want to

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,210
consider how to create consistently

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,329
available fluid web experience for our

00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:51,770
users we really need to think about

00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:54,920
resiliency as it applies to the entire

00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,380
development process even down to the

00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,680
obstacles that users might encounter

00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,960
when they're trying to access the web

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,000
but before I get into that I just want

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,119
to cover a few bases with progressive

00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,920
Web Apps and define what it is we have a

00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,240
few talks in this conference about

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,880
progressive Web Apps which is very

00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,070
exciting so you'll have a chance to dig

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,210
into the details a little bit more but

00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,680
essentially it's just a checklist of

00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:22,820
benchmarks that a web app will have an

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,820
order for it to be considered a

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,979
progressive web app so the first one is

00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,750
whether or not it's reliable meaning

00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:32,840
that it's available regardless of

00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:36,260
network environment so if it's available

00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,510
offline will your users still be able to

00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,420
consume content and engage with your app

00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:44,180
the other one is whether or not it's

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,970
fast this is made possible through

00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,189
service workers just like the offline

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,830
functionality is made possible through

00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:55,369
service workers where we cache certain

00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,960
assets that allow for us to serve up

00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:59,420
assets regardless of whether or not the

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,900
the connection is slow so we don't have

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,990
to load assets more than that first time

00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:08,810
to get that that initial voting going at

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,780
a blazing speed and lastly it should be

00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:13,820
engaging so progressive Web Apps make

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:16,549
available certain features that were

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,459
previously reserved for or only

00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:21,919
available in native apps things like

00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:22,730
making it available to add to your home

00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,610
page

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,280
or push notifications things that remind

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,019
users that your app is still there and

00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:34,040
that they should be frequenting it

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:36,230
regularly and like I mentioned a lot of

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,530
this is available made available through

00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:43,970
service workers which a quick and dirty

00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:46,910
definition is that there are web workers

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,700
that sit between the client and the

00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,250
network that cash assets and distribute

00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,580
they act as an intermediary essentially

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:57,650
to cash assets and offer them up to the

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,230
client when the network is down or the

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,450
network is slow allowing for users to

00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,329
have a very fluid experience regarding

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:09,440
regardless of what is happening with the

00:03:05,329 --> 00:03:13,220
network so going back to the concept of

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,459
resiliency that's the web is growing and

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:18,560
it is our job to connect our users to

00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:21,140
the web in all corners of the globe a

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,200
lot of these users are accessing the web

00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,620
in environments that are unfamiliar to

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:31,370
our own so it's our job to expand our

00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:33,380
horizons on how we can understand what

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,180
context they are accessing the web

00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:37,400
through and what kind of obstacles they

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:42,139
might encounter as they're trying to

00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,120
access our sites or use our products and

00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,350
so some of these are relatable to us and

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:48,980
others are not

00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:50,989
the some are could be austere context

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,060
and what I mean by this is like users

00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:53,959
that live in a more rugged environment

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,519
than our own

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:59,170
they have different accesses to

00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,600
resources they have different external

00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:03,950
influences on their lives that affect

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,200
the way that they interact with the

00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:08,359
Internet and if it's interact affecting

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,220
the way they interact with our products

00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,560
then it's our business to understand

00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,720
what those things are even if we

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,229
wouldn't imagine them in our day-to-day

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,090
lives the other one is variable

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:22,880
environments this is something that I

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:25,190
think we get and I think we we bring up

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,440
as examples a lot with progressive web

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,090
apps where like we might be traveling

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,060
across country and go through a dead

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,190
zone or we want to work on the train but

00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,180
the Wi-Fi is really bad so we can't

00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,729
actually be productive

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,620
and so or we want to work in Thailand

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:42,360
for a month and the Internet's very slow

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:44,580
and we we feel the pain of these

00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,889
changing environments as we move around

00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,270
the world but we won't ever really know

00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:53,550
what it's like to live in a remote

00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:55,650
village in Nigeria for example so it's

00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,009
becoming apparent that the global mobile

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:02,039
industry is more interested in providing

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:05,189
mobile data to more people in more

00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,259
places than they are in increasing speed

00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:09,990
for people that already have access to

00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:13,289
like the 4G network so what this means

00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,840
for us is that the majority of our user

00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:17,849
base is going to be accessing the web on

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,860
vastly different internet speeds than

00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:22,590
the ones that we develop on so the

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,599
average user that's accessing the web

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:27,300
for the first time is going to be doing

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:32,190
that over a 2g connection so this should

00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:36,240
be part of our idea of what an average

00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,949
user looks like as the as mobile users

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,949
continue to grow over time

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,860
the other one is remote environments

00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:48,949
this could be an agricultural scientist

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,539
who's going to the farm lands to collect

00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:53,819
information data from the soil and wants

00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:57,300
to be able to use his tools on the go or

00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:59,639
a Kenyan pastoralist who wants to keep

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,770
up-to-date with the news while he is

00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:03,810
watching his goats miles away from the

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,819
nearest settlement I was important to

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:09,270
note about this is that both of these

00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:12,629
types of users expect to be able to find

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,669
resources available to them in their day

00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,830
to day lives regardless of whether or

00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:20,279
not access to Internet is still

00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:23,009
available so users in Kenya for example

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:26,159
will they might come into contact with

00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:28,229
the mobile data maybe once a day but

00:06:26,159 --> 00:06:30,419
that doesn't mean that their activity

00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:31,949
stops when they leave the environment

00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:34,009
where they have access to data

00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,029
so they'll proactively seek out

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,639
applications where in their mind they

00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:40,529
can download information that they can

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,839
then access later so sometimes it is

00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:45,029
downloading articles and other times

00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,529
it's accessing web apps that are

00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,529
available offline for them

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,610
the other part is financial resources

00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:58,379
being limited so for when I was in Kenya

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:00,960
I spent like three months last year in

00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:02,969
Kenya for my job and I spent what I

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,240
thought was an exorbitant amount of

00:07:02,969 --> 00:07:10,289
money on mobile data and that was within

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,569
like my own living expenses like normal

00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:15,659
budget that I thought was exorbitant the

00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:19,469
number the amount of money that people

00:07:15,659 --> 00:07:22,139
have to spend on data is going down over

00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:24,149
time but it is still very expensive for

00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:25,949
people but they'll will that will make

00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,499
it a priority so these numbers were

00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:31,499
taken from the International Labour

00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:32,849
Organization in 2016 so it could be a

00:07:31,499 --> 00:07:38,240
little bit different but just to give

00:07:32,849 --> 00:07:40,550
you a bit of context Brazilian sorry

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,830
someone in Brazil making minimum wage

00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,529
might have to work up to 30 hours in

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:49,439
order to fight afford 500 megabytes of

00:07:46,529 --> 00:07:52,289
data so this means that their purchase

00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,509
of and usage of data is incredibly

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:57,149
budgeted so they're going to be very

00:07:54,509 --> 00:07:58,949
conscientious of how much money is going

00:07:57,149 --> 00:08:01,680
into their data and then what they're

00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:03,389
going to be using that data on so this

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,789
doesn't necessarily mean that their user

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:10,080
behaviors of what they check and what

00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:11,729
they access change like people users

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,560
tend to be they tend to gravitate

00:08:11,729 --> 00:08:15,240
towards the apps that they want

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,599
regardless of how much access to

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,029
megabytes that they have but they will

00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:22,620
be very careful as to what it is that

00:08:21,029 --> 00:08:26,610
they're going to be spending that money

00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,870
on on the other part of it is that

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:30,389
they're not going to be able to buy the

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,510
same phones that we use so they'll be

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:35,969
buying low-end or old smartphones and

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:40,050
these are known for having low RAM and

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:42,269
low memory in India 30% of smartphone

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,449
users run out of storage by the end of

00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,420
every day so what that means is that if

00:08:45,449 --> 00:08:50,430
they have to access five apps in a day

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,740
and they only have room for four they're

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,899
going to delete one app to make room for

00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,459
the other which is really bad news if

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,769
our app is the one that's getting

00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,490
deleted for them to be able to I don't

00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,589
know check their bank account and

00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:05,370
moment and then we just hope that they

00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:08,320
think of us again when they have

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:10,600
available space for us we don't want to

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,120
force users to have to make these types

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:20,890
of concessions which they do on a

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:22,240
regular basis the third one is a a topic

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,839
that's pretty near and dear to my heart

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,670
which is active obstructions so I think

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,680
we have all heard in the news about

00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:32,470
governments shutting down the internet

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:35,050
or blocking certain sites and I wanted

00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:38,830
to understand at a deeper level what

00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:40,750
this actually meant for the builders of

00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:43,300
the web if there's any way that our

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,520
understanding of these circumstances

00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,920
could affect that the way that we think

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:49,089
about progressive web apps or the way we

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,000
interact with our own development

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:53,740
process so it turns out that there's

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,990
three different types of shutdowns

00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:58,000
the first one there's very little that

00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:59,770
we can do about it these are countries

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,310
where the government has basically

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:06,010
entire control of the providers or

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:08,320
there's only like a handful of ISPs that

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:10,740
they can bully into literally unplugging

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,300
the Internet this doesn't happen very

00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,459
regularly because it's incredibly

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,350
expensive once the country goes dark it

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:19,600
goes dark for everybody and it kind of

00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:23,020
slows down the economy so if you have a

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,490
country that has a economy that depends

00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:26,430
on the internet this won't happen for

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,540
very long or won't happen very often

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:30,190
there are countries that do this

00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:32,290
regularly but they are countries that

00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:33,370
are very happy to live in the dark and

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,010
they just live in a completely different

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,800
era and we wouldn't be really talking

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:41,709
about users that are used to working

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,180
with the web on a regular basis anyway

00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:46,959
so there's not a lot of data points to

00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:49,420
collect on these places anyway the next

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,550
one is something that I think makes the

00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,700
news the most it's I think the most

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,070
volatile way to address controlling

00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,890
users access to the web which is when

00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,930
you block a site now research has shown

00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:04,540
that this isn't very effective it's not

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:06,730
useful and really deterring users from

00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,010
accessing the web because what happens

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:11,610
is after you block it for the first time

00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,800
people will just download a VPN

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:17,310
access whatever app they want from a

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,870
neighboring country so this happens

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:24,269
regularly but it's it's not there's not

00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,029
much that we as well developers can do

00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:29,120
about it that isn't already underway I

00:11:27,029 --> 00:11:31,380
think a lot of times it's really like a

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,269
factor for the government to show that

00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:37,649
they have control over these types of

00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:39,660
things and the third type is something

00:11:37,649 --> 00:11:42,779
that is well within our area of interest

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:46,380
which is bandwidth throttling this is

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:49,440
when governments will slow down either a

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:53,070
site or internet for certain

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,800
geographical regions in order to control

00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:00,570
their usage of it or their perception of

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:03,600
a site so for example in Sudan there was

00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:05,730
a huge it was a peaceful protest there

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,649
was an election and the youth were

00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:09,899
trying to advocate for a peaceful

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:11,670
transition of power and they were

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:14,990
conducting a sit-in and they're being

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:19,079
incredibly strategic about how to use

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:20,970
mobile platforms to alert the global

00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,410
community as to what was happening and

00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:26,100
what they're trying out to see if it

00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:28,440
could be productive for them and to

00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,269
communicate and coordinate amongst each

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,370
other what they're going to do now

00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:34,709
leading up to this the government was

00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:36,420
actively throttling the internet so that

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,850
it would be much harder for them to

00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:41,010
coordinate activities and then they

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,769
ended up blocking a bunch of sites and

00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:45,720
that the country went dark for a bit and

00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:48,720
that's when they had their crackdown so

00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,420
a few weeks later we woke up a few went

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,920
to the news of the atrocities that the

00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,860
government conducted in order to

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,860
actually deter these protesters from

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:03,779
making any more momentum than they

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:05,250
already had Kazakhstan has on and off

00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:07,320
for I think every time they have

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,860
elections they actively throttle sites

00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,459
of news outlets that cover any political

00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,769
opponents and they'll also anytime a

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:20,040
political opponent will get on line to

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:21,540
speak bill throttle different sites

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:25,100
where people are having conversations

00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,660
about it now throttling is superstud

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,580
four people a lot of people don't know

00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,050
that it's a thing so they can't keep an

00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,600
eye out for whether or not this is a

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:34,610
deterrent that's being placed on them so

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,260
people might not be aware of this

00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,630
candidate they might not be aware that

00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,370
there's actually new sites because they

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:42,470
might go to a side lose patience that

00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:45,860
it's so slow and then just go to the

00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:47,960
government site where the you know the

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:52,180
preferred candidate has all the coverage

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:56,000
and is very easy to interact with them

00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:59,900
it's also a way for governments to try

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:03,140
to direct users into using specific

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,640
platforms so they might have like you

00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,010
know Facebook might be incredibly slow

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,320
in their country but the government

00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:10,940
version of it is not and so users don't

00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,740
think that the government's pushing them

00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:15,380
in the direction of a site that's

00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:20,240
heavily surveilled but in fact that they

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,820
are what's interesting is that the

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,830
combination of blocking and throttling

00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,870
is the most potent so if you throttle

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:28,870
the site and then you block it people

00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:32,330
will be a lesson raged and try to find a

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:34,880
VPN or try to like jump the firewall so

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:37,880
to speak they'll just have been so

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,370
frustrated and trying to access their

00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,380
that site that they'll say okay now it's

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:46,130
blocked like whatever already has my

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:48,650
alternative so finding some good stats

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:50,750
on this is really difficult because it's

00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:53,210
very difficult for people to tact and to

00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:56,330
report on but while I was doing my

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:59,060
research the the countries that you

00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:03,920
would expect came up most frequently in

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,900
examples of proactive rattling and it

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:12,320
turns out that highly correlates with

00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:15,380
their Internet freedom scores so the

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,430
question is what is it that we can do to

00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,960
affect the way that people what kind of

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,800
freedom people have with the internet

00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:26,660
now we have our native apps but

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,650
progressive web apps allow users to

00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:33,410
access a site on any device and with any

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:36,200
browsers in any type of condition so

00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,620
like native it will allow for offline

00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,660
functionality

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,000
it'll allow for fast load times which is

00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,090
crucial and the perception of being

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,290
connected a lot of this is about people

00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,150
feeling like they're connected

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:51,480
regardless of what kind of network

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:54,420
conditions are in existence at that time

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,010
and we can have more user engagements

00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:58,770
they don't have to have as many hurdles

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,140
to access the web if they're or this

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:04,380
your particular site if it's already on

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,510
their home screen but in addition to all

00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:10,350
of that there's a low barrier to entry

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:13,080
on both for developers and for users as

00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,800
well because you don't have to go to the

00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,090
App Store

00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:17,130
even though app stores have a lot of

00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:19,980
benefit in their own right

00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:21,420
you there's no reason not to add a

00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,580
progressive web app to your phone or

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:27,390
your your tablet whatever your data

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:29,340
device is and for developers as a web

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:31,410
developer myself I find it incredibly

00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:34,170
encouraging that I can just augment the

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:36,300
projects I'm working on by mastering

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,460
serviceworkers and adding some design

00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:41,130
features to create a native like

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,900
experience and so if you're managing a

00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:45,030
project and you're trying to decide

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,550
where to put your resources do you make

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:49,260
a web app and a native app with

00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:51,810
progressive web apps you don't have to

00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,850
choose you can just extend your web app

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,980
into the progressive web app world and

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,610
you get a lot of benefits from that

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,640
um it's fresh in the sense that you

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:05,120
don't have to wait for the next update

00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:07,350
all you have to do is push too broad and

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,060
given that your service workers are

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:11,579
refreshing as they should

00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,860
users can get the next version of your

00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,820
app so iterating quickly is really great

00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,160
especially if you're trying to

00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:19,110
understand user needs and you're trying

00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,079
to cater to a new user group this is

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:25,770
really useful and making very quick

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:30,060
iterations on your product it's very

00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:34,350
light it's lighter than a progressive a

00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,180
native app in many instances so you'll

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:38,220
see some companies will have both a

00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:40,650
native app and a progressive web app

00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:42,180
like Twitter for example I think a lot

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:43,650
of us have the native app for Twitter

00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,050
because it works just fine we don't

00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:49,740
really think about it but Twitter light

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:50,250
is uses 70% less data and it loads 30%

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,679
quicker

00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:54,480
so if you're the user that needs to make

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,090
these considerations on how much data

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,309
you're going to use then you're going to

00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,169
weigh this out and there's there's

00:17:59,309 --> 00:18:05,130
incentive for companies to have both

00:18:01,169 --> 00:18:07,590
native and progressive web apps so this

00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:09,809
will this will really cater to a

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:12,690
specific user group for that reason and

00:18:09,809 --> 00:18:15,090
lastly it's discoverable like we have

00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,130
SEO options that native doesn't have

00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,780
which is really nice for getting this

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,950
into that more people's hands people

00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,950
know how to find it

00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:27,480
so not all mobile apps should be

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,690
progressive web apps I think there is

00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,559
definitely space for both but all apps

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:37,140
should meet progressive benchmarks this

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,850
is beyond a discussion of mobile

00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,640
environments this is a lot to do with

00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:46,049
what I use or an ideal user experience

00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:47,730
should look like in our world so if

00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:50,669
you're interested in getting started you

00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:53,850
haven't there's a lot of tools available

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:56,070
if you use react create react app starts

00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:59,190
starts you out with service workers it's

00:18:56,070 --> 00:19:00,659
not you know it's not fully offline

00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:02,820
because you still have to build your app

00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,289
on it but it shows you how to get

00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,850
started with service workers and from

00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:08,340
there you can build out your strategies

00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:11,820
that suit the needs of the project that

00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:13,320
you're working on gatsby also has a lot

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:15,780
of resources around offline

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:17,100
functionality really helps you get on

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:20,610
your way without too much cognitive

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,650
overhead and as I was making this list I

00:19:20,610 --> 00:19:24,330
didn't realize how much of this is

00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,730
already represented in the conference so

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:28,890
there's a there's a Gatsby talk and then

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,250
there's another talk I think right after

00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:35,429
this that talks about work box which is

00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:39,750
a great tool to just kind of like make

00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:42,570
the the the overhead of working with

00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,429
service workers a little bit easier and

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,830
service workers are really like the crux

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,260
of it like they're not the easiest API

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,440
to work with but they are essential and

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:55,289
so Dave Geddes has this game called

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,999
service work ease and you get a like

00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:59,099
become like a superhero and

00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:01,319
and about how service workers work and

00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,989
like how to get this started so really

00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:06,329
there's only there's all the reasons to

00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:07,979
get into service workers and progressive

00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:10,469
Web Apps if you only just want to end

00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:14,969
this conference and go play game like

00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:16,709
that's available to you as well and if

00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:20,039
you do want to start integrating these

00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:22,079
these features into your app I would

00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:24,179
recommend just starting with initial

00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:26,789
cast caching of assets getting that time

00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:28,679
to interactive up and improving your

00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:30,449
responsive design I imagine most of you

00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,169
already have bed as part of your

00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:36,389
workflow and considering more nuanced

00:20:34,169 --> 00:20:37,999
breakdowns to create a more

00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:40,469
pixel-perfect

00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:42,599
responsive experience for your users so

00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:45,449
they'll feel like on your app it's

00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,939
actually a app that was designed for

00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:50,819
their device rather than retrofitted to

00:20:47,939 --> 00:20:52,649
the device offline functionality get

00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:55,049
started with registering service workers

00:20:52,649 --> 00:20:57,629
and build incrementally from there and

00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,729
then add the engagements that you think

00:20:57,629 --> 00:21:02,849
will be most beneficial like getting the

00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:06,449
home screen functionality working or

00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:08,729
opiate access using certain API is to

00:21:06,449 --> 00:21:10,649
work with camera or push notifications

00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:12,569
whatever it is that you find to be most

00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:15,239
exciting as it pertains to your project

00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:17,339
start working with that and then start

00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:21,929
working into more of the progressive web

00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:25,049
app design now from my past experience I

00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:26,759
found that if you work if you just jump

00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:29,459
into service workers and you get your

00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,259
web app working offline

00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:34,229
you're not going to and you don't

00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:37,079
communicate that with your with your

00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:39,839
users they might not know to go to your

00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:42,569
app when the network is down so having

00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,189
some sort of design that lets them know

00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:45,659
that they're offline that this is still

00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:47,789
working that they still can interact

00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:49,319
with your app is really crucial for them

00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:52,949
to bridge the gap and how they think

00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:56,159
about your app next make sure you test

00:21:52,949 --> 00:21:58,079
as you go it's not fun testing service

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,509
workers I would recommend starting with

00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:03,359
browser unit testing integration tests

00:22:00,509 --> 00:22:04,799
and unit tests are really helpful it's

00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,909
really easy when you're creating the

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,350
unit tests to create the ideal

00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:11,750
environment for service workers and then

00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:14,030
think that everything's fine don't get

00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:16,250
stuck in chrome I only say this as a

00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:19,460
complement to Chrome they have amazing

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:21,860
resources it's a it's a dream to work in

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,380
chrome with progressive Web Apps but you

00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:26,270
can't there's no guarantee that your

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:28,760
users are only going to access your app

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:32,390
through Chrome so make sure you're aware

00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,730
of the benefits and like the things that

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:36,289
are different and different different

00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:37,820
browsers so when you're choosing which

00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:40,460
features are going to work with you know

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:42,320
what the drawbacks are for users

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,740
accessing it through Safari or Firefox

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:49,280
for example address

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,720
pheww a features frequently and early if

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,610
it's something that you tack on at the

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,860
end of a project it's not likely to get

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:56,720
included I think that's just true for

00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:59,150
any cool thing that you want to work on

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:04,549
and it doesn't seem as daunting when you

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:08,150
think of your timeline with PWA I'm not

00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:10,490
integrated into it and then make it a

00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:13,130
hobby to expand your horizons on what

00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,350
user needs to look like in a world where

00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:18,250
we have emerging markets and expanding

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,940
users throughout the world because

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:25,510
ultimately your work makes an impact and

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:28,039
you have to make sure that it has the

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,659
the reach that your users require so

00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:31,770
they can benefit from what you're doing

00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:35,630
thank you

00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:38,280
[Applause]

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:41,669
Thank You Nicolina hopefully we have

00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:45,450
questions for you too so let's start how

00:23:41,669 --> 00:23:49,890
is it with elastic MySQL databases do

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:52,350
they work with PWA I'm not sure yeah

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:56,190
all right that's totally fine is PW a

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:57,840
well supported on iOS yes yes there are

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,870
drawbacks to it but there's a lot of

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,940
support available for it what are the

00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,880
major challenges in writing and Service

00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,530
Worker I think the one thing that most

00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:09,690
people run into is that they get a

00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,090
service worker working and then they

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:14,309
don't get it refreshing in the right way

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:16,350
so you'll have all of these changes that

00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:18,390
you're pushing to your app but the

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:20,580
service worker is not acknowledging

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,610
those changes so making sure that you

00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:26,340
have exit strategies involved like from

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:28,650
the onset that will really prevent you

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,590
from getting stuck in the serviceworker

00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:33,360
hell where you don't know why your your

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,980
app isn't reflecting the changes that

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,650
you've made

00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:40,470
what about user awareness about the PW

00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:43,289
A's for example on the iOS you cannot

00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,600
even promote it to them if I'm not

00:24:43,289 --> 00:24:48,809
mistaken so I've heard this in

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,000
conversation about like whether or not

00:24:48,809 --> 00:24:52,409
it's in the App Store's and that's

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,020
something that's actively being worked

00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:57,440
on the perception of or the

00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:00,690
understanding that they exist is

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:03,419
something that we are building towards

00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:05,159
right it's relative relatively new that

00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:08,760
we're incorporating this into our

00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:11,429
workflow and so making sure that it's

00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,409
prominent on your on your site that they

00:25:11,429 --> 00:25:15,240
can install it and then once it's

00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:16,559
installed on their home screen they

00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,870
don't really think about whether or not

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,780
it's a progressive web app versus a

00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:24,150
native app I think the initial adoption

00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:26,940
is probably like the big conversation to

00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:30,780
have and so letting people know through

00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:32,000
like your own UX is helpful I think that

00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,190
would be a place to start

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:40,650
great which big sites or companies have

00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:42,539
PA uber has it twitter has it trivago

00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,420
has been a like a really big success

00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,580
story with that

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:48,050
I have like a lot of resources at the

00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,600
end of the slide so I'll be publishing

00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:52,190
that and there's this whole site with

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,140
PWA stats of what kind of success people

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,350
have had with progressive web apps so I

00:25:54,140 --> 00:26:00,050
recommend you check that out we'll PWA

00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:04,760
work well with server-side reknit

00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:08,600
rendering will it work well a

00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:14,000
server-side rendering yes yeah sure

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:15,950
how about bwa and micro-services i don't

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,190
really think there's any sort of barrier

00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:21,680
there yeah and then last question how

00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:25,460
service workers work with highly dynamic

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:30,920
web apps highly dynamic in the sense

00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:33,470
that I guess multiple like you're

00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,970
getting different user interactions or

00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:37,760
highly dynamic in the sense that you're

00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:40,280
getting page loads at different times I

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,450
think it depends but you really just

00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:43,490
have to pair your serviceworker

00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,410
strategies with the way that your web

00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,390
app is designed and maybe start with

00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:50,330
like the most crucial components of your

00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,370
app and then build out from there great

00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:52,960
thank you so much this is Nicola and I

00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:56,130
hope not

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,130
