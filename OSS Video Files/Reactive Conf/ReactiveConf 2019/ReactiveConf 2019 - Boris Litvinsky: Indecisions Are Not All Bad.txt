All our software is a bundle of decisions. But despite the fact that some decisions can have a long-lasting, crippling effect on our app, we make most of them based on guesses.
But what if the best decision is indecision? What if you could postpone most of your decision until you gather enough facts in order to make the optimal one?
In this talk, we will learn why deferring decisions can result in a much better, simpler code base. Weâ€™ll see examples of decisions we think we have to take on day 1 of the project, yet, can (and should) be postponed and see how practices like Spikes and the right design of your application will allow that to happen.
