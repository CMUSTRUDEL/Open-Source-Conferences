00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,419
well the energy levels in the room are

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,640
amazing hello everybody

00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:29,179
good those of you who are in the back

00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,970
move come close plenty of seats and also

00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:36,859
those of you are in conversation just

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:38,840
finish it and listen this is all about a

00:00:36,859 --> 00:00:41,329
universe in this conference right you

00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,850
see all the space stuff so I would like

00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:45,199
you to focus your lens away from the

00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,690
technology conversations you've had

00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:49,850
earlier but actually think about a very

00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:53,300
different part of this universe which is

00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:55,359
all around financial technology a bit

00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:00,440
show of hands who in the room here is

00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:03,100
aware of FinTech show of hands not

00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,780
everybody or not everybody's listening

00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,620
okay who in the room here is involved in

00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:11,690
FinTech good so hopefully this is going

00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,130
to be relevant when the organizers

00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,810
approached me to have a session about

00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,360
FinTech they wanted to talk about trends

00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,380
and I said guys we can talk about trends

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,640
for five minutes and then the

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,520
conversation is done we can talk about

00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,200
AI VR blah blah blockchain but that

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,550
means absolutely nothing because you

00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,460
need to understand what do you actually

00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:31,250
do with the technology that is built on

00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:34,850
these trends and that's where the

00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:36,980
problems come so I suggested that we

00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:38,930
talk about the difficulty that the

00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,240
players in the fin tech ecosystem have

00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,620
to engage with each other and those of

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,020
you are intrinsic you will probably know

00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,480
what that means it's difficult so we

00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:49,370
have a panel that represents the

00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,440
different aspects of the ecosystem with

00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,120
somebody representing a bank somebody

00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,680
representing a fin tech company somebody

00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:58,280
representing a tech shop who builds for

00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,230
banks and fintechs but just so I give

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,370
some background that I also know a

00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,450
little bit what I'm talking about I've

00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,460
been around in the financial industry

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:05,750
for 20 years spent the last nine years

00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:07,730
of my life in financial services

00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,959
innovation and a co-founded something

00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,069
called startup bootcamp in tech which

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,140
was the first global fainting

00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:14,540
accelerator so we've seen a lot of

00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,870
startups trying to enter this space and

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,580
at the same time

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:19,620
we used to work with the banks and help

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,599
them with innovation needs so we've also

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,049
seen why the industry is struggling to

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,420
actually do something meaningful more

00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:30,840
importantly and just to see if histor

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:34,140
listening the very first person I hired

00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:38,450
in my business for start-up would come

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:42,480
FinTech at the end of 2013 6 years ago

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:46,620
thought FinTech means technology from

00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,069
Finland and I'm saying this just to show

00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,920
that the whole hyper on FinTech it's

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:55,680
just six years old the whole wave only

00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,030
started in 2014-2015 and our four or

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,079
five years down the line we're in a

00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:01,500
situation where everybody knows

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:04,200
something about it but actually not a

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,269
lot has happened or has it and that's

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,750
what we're trying to figure out so I'm

00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:11,190
super excited to welcome my panel who is

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,340
going to talk about this and is

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,450
Mahalakshmi de it's true Graham and his

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,670
multi-touch Nick

00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:21,770
so please welcome a panel

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,360
[Applause]

00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:29,220
got the order right you got the order I

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,960
made it so I was a little bit cheeky and

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,760
suggesting we call this y is the

00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:39,590
industry struggling to embrace FinTech

00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:42,330
you may disagree but before we do that

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:44,820
maybe just do a little round and you

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,980
guys just introduce yourselves by

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,360
explaining a little bit why you think

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,750
you've been invited to come here and

00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,490
talk me how to understand yeah sure

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,060
so probably because we have an office

00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:58,380
very close by I mean throws 100 reasons

00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,480
no I think so when you look at the

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,370
region Center in Eastern Europe we're

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
probably building the biggest Bank

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:07,320
Challenger so obviously all of you heard

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,330
of revolute number 26 and munzo so we're

00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:12,780
trying to build something like that but

00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,670
into region and on a local level we also

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:16,680
work with vacuum labs so they're helping

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,549
us put together our attack so yeah

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,390
that's fine

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:23,880
very good true why are you here why am I

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,710
here why did I get invited because I've

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,020
been on both sides of this I've just

00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,820
spent the last 10 years living in Asia

00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,070
I built a couple of banks built a lot of

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,740
FinTech companies over there and then

00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:36,870
have rented my soul for the last couple

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,110
of years and I've done a couple of years

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:42,090
working inside a big bank so I've seen

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,900
both sides of it and so I can maybe give

00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,490
a nuanced and reasonably direct view I'm

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,020
very disappointed that we have a banker

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,080
on stage who doesn't want to be a banker

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,240
doesn't look like a banker it's shocking

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,640
a closest thing to a banker look-alike

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,340
is actually mighty why are you here and

00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,980
this is my casual look hello a good

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,720
afternoon one of the reasons why I

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:08,400
probably am here is also that we're Co

00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,440
organizing this conference is that we we

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,790
do a lot in FinTech we we are

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,740
engineering and partnering with a lot of

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,870
banks and challenges of fintechs over

00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,460
the world so we we have a knowledge or

00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:20,790
we hopefully have knowledge or I go to

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,950
us have knowledge on and how to belt the

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,470
internet part of off of a challenger

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:29,400
bank or or if in sec so like that

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,990
thank you so do I have a point with a

00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,600
question or did you actually disagree

00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,639
with the original premise is the

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,830
financial services

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,560
this is struggling to embrace FinTech

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:41,090
all our things actually good and it's

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:46,389
just me being a bit naive and a bit

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:48,860
cynical should I start it off right good

00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:52,129
no so I think look you said it yourself

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,229
intake is a very new thing banks have

00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:55,969
been here for hundreds of years and then

00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,669
there's this kinda new emergent player

00:05:55,969 --> 00:06:00,770
who is trying to use technology to make

00:05:58,669 --> 00:06:03,710
finance easier simpler and more fun for

00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:05,150
the user so to me as I don't think we

00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:07,009
have the answer yet

00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:08,449
I think there's a big difference between

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:10,430
East and the West

00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:12,409
actually the other way around and if you

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,150
look at for example London I think there

00:06:12,409 --> 00:06:15,080
are huge fintax with you know millions

00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,909
of customers

00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,139
I think the banks are realizing you know

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:20,360
the shift is happening and they're

00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:22,550
trying to kind of get on the wave but if

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,139
you look at East so where we are today I

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,479
think many of the banks are still very

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,460
skeptical of in tax you have fintechs

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,449
who haven't really got a certain stage

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:34,520
or size for them to really matter and I

00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:34,849
think in terms of kind of the working

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,650
model

00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:38,360
it's about FinTech working with banks

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,680
and that's not really happening on the

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,360
level that we would like to see

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,849
especially in our further part of the

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,960
world which means central Eastern Europe

00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:46,699
okay thank you

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,370
well dig deeper onto the why but I would

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:50,569
like to hear from drew how you think you

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,279
haven't been with two different banks

00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:54,620
now I mean the banks are actually

00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:56,509
working with FinTech whatever that means

00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,430
whatever that means I think that's the

00:06:56,509 --> 00:07:01,639
key bit let's try not go down the rabbit

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,629
hole of of what is FinTech but it kind

00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:07,639
of does depend what type of FinTech

00:07:05,629 --> 00:07:08,930
we're talking about and I kind of bucket

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,240
them into three buckets there's the

00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,039
fintechs that want to sell to banks

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,409
there's the fintechs that want to sell

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,969
through banks and there's the fintechs

00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:19,039
that will just want to go under the

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,479
banks or disintermediate the banks and

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,339
we kind of had a first wave at the

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,870
beginning of it with these fin tech

00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,089
companies that thought that what had

00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:30,919
happened with advertising and online

00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:32,779
travel and transport could just happen

00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,099
with financial services as well this

00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:37,189
idea that you just had to do something

00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,509
ten times cheaper ten times better put

00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:41,240
it in front of a user and we were done

00:07:38,509 --> 00:07:43,909
and that didn't work the banks are still

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,069
here and they are largely the same as

00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:47,860
they were six years ago and then we had

00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,580
this second wave of

00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,409
organizations that decided they were

00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,330
going to be FinTech and try and sell to

00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:55,460
the banks and that was a bit more

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:57,289
successful but that then led to the

00:07:55,460 --> 00:08:00,289
realization that banks are incapable of

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:02,509
working with these small agile young

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,279
startups because they are the opposite

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:05,659
of all of those things they're not small

00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:09,139
they're big they're young they're old

00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:13,129
they're not agile they're very calcified

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:15,490
in how they approach tough and so we've

00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:18,459
kind of gone through these two stages

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:24,080
now the question is what happens next

00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:25,699
Manzo evolute different localizations of

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,959
the same business model is starting to

00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:28,399
get some traction with that but they're

00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,169
not actually making any money they don't

00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,729
actually have businesses what they have

00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,430
is you could use of acquisition channels

00:08:31,729 --> 00:08:35,839
which is great but it's not the end of

00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,789
itself so I think the premise of your

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,380
question is true but you probably have

00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:41,269
to compartmentalize it about what we

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,360
mean when we say that cool thanks for

00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:47,029
that my team I would rather look at it

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:50,149
in geographies right in different places

00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:52,579
around the world it's different yes

00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,290
because it's you know like Western

00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,850
Eastern Europe have different it's cute

00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:56,959
and they're different mentalities how do

00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:58,670
you want to partner if they want to

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:01,819
partner and what they do there but also

00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,949
we should look in the States right it's

00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:05,449
compared to us is pretty backwards in

00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:06,889
terms of how they want to cooperate how

00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:09,079
they want to work with with with with

00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:11,600
fintechs and with with newer technology

00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,060
they're still pretty legacy but then you

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,829
look at Asia and Asia is some in some

00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,790
some terms pretty advanced in what

00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:18,889
they're trying to do and what are

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,110
building but you wouldn't say it's a

00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:22,399
financial services sector because all

00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:25,759
the although innovation is happening

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,980
there came from you know big tech giants

00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,069
that just happen to launch a financial

00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:33,620
offering so so it's it's interesting how

00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:35,060
different geographies look at providing

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,569
financial services differently in

00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,759
different models so I'm glad you sort of

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:42,819
agree with the premise so that allows us

00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:46,430
to have a conversation that's relevant

00:09:42,819 --> 00:09:47,899
so in my time at start a boot camp the

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,430
thing we've realized is that we're

00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:51,819
actually working in an industry that

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:55,069
should look at early-stage startups as

00:09:51,819 --> 00:09:57,290
R&D later stage startups as potential

00:09:55,069 --> 00:09:59,689
proofs of concept partners and the more

00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,470
mature companies as potential working

00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:02,120
partners if you like

00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,180
especially the startups who want to work

00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,139
with the banks but bizarrely it's an

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,690
industry that actually doesn't

00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:11,149
understand the concept of R&D which is

00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,170
really kind of weird when you try and

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,660
figure out how do you actually build

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,579
product like the ever other industry has

00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,800
research teams development teams nothing

00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,029
none of this right but when you try to

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,439
have the conversation with a large

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:24,019
institutions that were really struggling

00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:25,850
to even conceptualize that there is a

00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:28,399
needs to play around with the new new

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,050
stuff and then at the second stage

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,569
figuring out how is is relevant for the

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:34,189
company does it interface and then okay

00:10:32,569 --> 00:10:35,959
they have traction then maybe we should

00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:37,129
work with them but also maybe for the

00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,079
context of the audience a lot of the

00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:41,509
conversation we are having revolves

00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,180
around retail banking is a individual

00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:46,069
experience as consumers and this is

00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,920
where we see the revolutes and the

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:50,660
Manzo's of this world been successful

00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,819
because as the whole other aspect of the

00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:54,769
industry which is investment banking and

00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,149
the plumbing underneath and and we sort

00:10:54,769 --> 00:10:58,129
of sometimes mix in the conversation

00:10:56,149 --> 00:10:59,389
because there's one brand with 25

00:10:58,129 --> 00:11:01,040
different businesses underneath who are

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,689
very very different at the different

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,639
stages of their their readiness for

00:11:02,689 --> 00:11:09,230
innovation right I'm kind of to your

00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,490
point - I'm quite curious to dig a

00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,560
little bit deeper into the three

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:14,089
categories of companies because you put

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,829
it really nicely with the ones who work

00:11:14,089 --> 00:11:17,959
with the banks through the banks or

00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:19,819
under the banks right because memorize

00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:24,139
that if anything to take away it's that

00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:27,220
different categories so which one is the

00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:30,639
one that you as somebody who works in

00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:35,329
strategy within a bank is the most

00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:43,509
interesting of the categories and which

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:46,550
one is the scariest interesting

00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:48,470
interesting is very attractive appealing

00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,360
appealing to me or appealing to Barclays

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:52,040
appealing to the bank appealing to the

00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,130
bank well it's got to be the people that

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,620
don't to end up solving our problems and

00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:01,759
we as an organization of god´s

00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,920
a large amount of problems many of which

00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,809
related to technology many of which

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,370
aren't and being able to find a company

00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,529
that's going to be able to help us serve

00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:11,600
those problems would be the category

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,800
that's most interesting to us I think

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,220
that

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:18,980
when the default interpretation of

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,810
FinTech when the topic comes up in a

00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,950
meeting inside a large Bank is actually

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:24,019
the kind of companies that want to

00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:29,810
disintermediate us and go underneath us

00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:32,589
and there is a general recognition that

00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:36,500
that they've had some success but that

00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:39,760
the success has not been as big as was

00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:43,160
hyped that it was going to be and

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,450
because of that we when we as an

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,010
industry now I'm not talking about

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,980
Berkeley specifically but we as an

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,360
industry of an incumbent banks tend to

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,490
kind of dismiss the fact that it might

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:57,940
happen and I think that we've been a

00:12:52,490 --> 00:13:01,579
victim slightly of our own media and

00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:04,519
conference circus where there has been

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,560
this obvious progression about how the

00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,170
financial services industry is going to

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,430
go and it's been obvious because we've

00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,019
seen it happen in various other

00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:15,290
industries and so we're just saying that

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:17,149
finances and special it's just next and

00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:19,250
so we've talked all about these things

00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:20,839
that are going to happen that how the

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:23,420
platforms of Asia are going to end up

00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,160
completely redefining what banking looks

00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:27,589
like and how that the banks are going to

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,570
get unbundled and disintermediated and

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,829
we talked about it and then we will come

00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:32,149
back for the next conference the next

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:34,730
year and not really much has happened

00:13:32,149 --> 00:13:35,720
and so the next topic is well the thing

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,640
that we said that was going to happen

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,540
hasn't happened and then we kind of

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,860
dismiss it so that when it does happen

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:44,959
we don't give it as much attention

00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:46,459
because we'd already dismissed it as a

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,320
thing that wasn't going to happen and

00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:49,790
the two examples here a ubers

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,399
announcement earlier this week around

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:55,190
the fact that they are now doing a range

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:59,060
of financial services around effectively

00:13:55,190 --> 00:14:01,910
payments and loans and then the idea

00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:03,380
that Google ended up did end up getting

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,360
into financial services with tears in

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,760
India and both of these things happen so

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,930
far after we've been talking about it

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,260
that we didn't need Perry much attention

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:14,240
so the interest from the bank is in the

00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:17,750
companies that are willing to help us

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,160
solve our problems the strategic

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,779
interests and so my bid of the bank

00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,790
which is not necessarily thinking about

00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:24,200
today's problem but trying to figure out

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,720
what tomorrow's problem might be

00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,610
is very much focused on the companies

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,959
that want to disintermediate us and sell

00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:36,019
underneath us and try and get everybody

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,579
inside the bank to actually focus on a

00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,130
more realistic timeline of their

00:14:37,579 --> 00:14:41,990
expectations and try and get the message

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,790
across that there is an inevitability

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,980
that this is going to have a material

00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:48,350
impact on the industry and just because

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:51,589
it didn't happen in the kind of timeline

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,940
we expect when we all have to go to six

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:54,350
conferences a year every couple of

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,600
months it doesn't mean that it's not

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,250
going to happen in a timeline that's

00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,550
going to be significant for the people

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:05,029
who still need to work five or ten years

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,440
before they can retire so maybe approach

00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:08,630
it from a different perspective because

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,070
when we started we said we want to

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,260
challenge banks we want to be better

00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:14,990
than banks and then we ended up selling

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,360
20% of the company to a bank so we work

00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:19,490
at a job we did well but we actually

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,649
sold it to a bank and also a venture arm

00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,630
of a bank so we can endure both of them

00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,720
wretched irrational for us was kind of

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:28,399
twofold so one we require a lot of

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,190
capital not because we take huge

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,380
salaries and drive nice cars but because

00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:36,260
the FinTech business is very capital

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,329
intensive number one number two it

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:40,010
actually takes much longer to build out

00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:41,600
the technological stacks so we thought

00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:44,120
you know we actually launched the

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,589
product in three months and then we you

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,029
know realize that she takes more than

00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:48,560
three months to launch new features

00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:52,310
because the system really gets very

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,350
complex so it's a thing on a long run it

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,269
requires a lot of capital venture

00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,940
capital investors they do have about

00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:00,410
five years of patients and banks I shall

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,360
have a patience for the next 100 years

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:04,610
so for us a bank was a very good

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,760
investor because it's a patient capital

00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,740
they can also provide distribution if

00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:11,600
your chair agree with them they're

00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,519
horrible to work with on a technical

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,829
side so if you traded a solution

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,660
together with a bank in Poland and it

00:16:15,829 --> 00:16:20,029
was really a big thing for us because

00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,100
they said look we have api's we are

00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:23,569
ready to integrate but then we realized

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,930
actually none of that is really you know

00:16:23,569 --> 00:16:28,819
in place so it was a struggle on the

00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:30,260
technical side to put a product together

00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:32,569
with them we thought I'll take you know

00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,580
two three months eh it took a year and a

00:16:32,569 --> 00:16:38,279
half so banks do take a bit longer

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,870
it has is you know pros and cons but it

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,290
from a perspective of a start-up of a

00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,480
fin tech startup working with the bank

00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:48,660
great for getting along a lot of cash

00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,820
for long term but if you want to do a

00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:53,579
product with them it's pretty tough it

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,589
takes a lot of patience so yeah so are

00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:58,500
you are you sort of halfway under the

00:16:55,589 --> 00:17:00,720
bank or so we're doing both so we're

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,880
kind of going under with some other

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,679
products and that's nice to see you know

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,270
the retail guys and a bank saying look

00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,890
your she's stealing our customers and

00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,150
then we are actually on the other side

00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,319
what you're building a product together

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,480
with them and acquiring customers

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,630
together that's a very twisted or pro

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,760
like it is twister right yeah yeah it's

00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:19,559
very twisted yeah and it's interesting

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
to see the levels of discussion across

00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:23,309
the bank from the CEO to people top down

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,870
or the headquarters some people like

00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:26,760
really hate us they say you are like

00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:28,260
sucking money out you're stealing our

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,520
customers and the other guys are saying

00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:33,000
great we're building a business together

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,740
yeah it's it's you know fun times when

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,860
we're talking about the opportunity

00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,140
rights in this space I'm gonna look at

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:42,990
all the engineers and developers in this

00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,179
room and just say that there's you know

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,370
since there's so much like a sea and

00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:49,320
there's so much old-school stuff in the

00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:52,679
engineering world and in the journeying

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:55,410
departments of the bank's any even small

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,450
incremental help and innovation and

00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,070
thing that you do there as an engineer

00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:01,620
has tremendous impact

00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:04,110
so trying to build something in the

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:06,960
world of financial services is actually

00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,450
really interesting and I'm a true

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,260
believer that you know money makes the

00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,380
world go round

00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:15,960
and that through the change in the way

00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,059
how people pay help people invest and

00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,000
how people save you can change their

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:24,690
behaviors like like Marc and clay like

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,809
really really well and I'm gonna just

00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:29,520
say that as engineers in this room there

00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:31,169
is a lot of potential to build some

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,270
really interesting stuff that can be

00:18:31,169 --> 00:18:37,440
really influential and changed a lot of

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:40,050
people's minds and lives I've seen that

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:43,530
you know when we've played and build

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:46,020
stuff and different verticals it's

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:47,910
interesting in its lifestyle and it's

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:49,590
something you know entertainment media

00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,300
but when you go to fine

00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,760
it really matters what you built right

00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,410
it should work you should not lose the

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:58,570
money the transaction should be

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:00,940
immutable you should really have it safe

00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:02,920
and and a lot of the stuff and for

00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,680
proper engineers and developers in this

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:07,030
room those are you know easy things to

00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:09,880
do and you understand that that's

00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,190
necessary but a lot of the people to

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,660
understand it so even the fact that

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,940
you're here today and you're listening

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,490
to all the talks on on this conference

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,640
you have a very good head start in and

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,230
being being a pretty pretty interesting

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,020
player in the in the financial sector

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:30,040
and building in FinTech are you

00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:31,300
recruiting possibly yeah we are hiring

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,790
as well by the way

00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:38,440
yes we're all hiring yes they're like no

00:19:33,790 --> 00:19:39,700
you're not hiring we probably are but I

00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,860
mean since you brought in the tech

00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:44,650
perspective I sort of linking back to

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,750
the beginning how important is actually

00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,120
the tech element in this conversation

00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:52,090
oh is this more about the business model

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,150
elements that is making the big changes

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:56,590
I have a very strong view on this maybe

00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:59,170
I can go first and then everyone else

00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:00,790
can disagree with me bearing in mind I

00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,850
know that I'm a technology conference

00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:07,120
here my view is that the technology

00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:09,130
matters but it matters at the end it

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,110
doesn't matter at the beginning all of

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,140
the stuff that banks are either

00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:16,510
incapable of doing at the moment or all

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,240
of the stuff that is disrupting banks if

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:21,280
you kind of go through the five wise or

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,180
seven wise or kind of get down to a root

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:28,150
cause it comes down to a combination of

00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:30,460
risk frameworks organizational structure

00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:34,060
and the design of the incentives and

00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,650
actually the technology sits on the

00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,270
ability to build the technology and the

00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:39,520
ability to do stuff that is going to be

00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:41,020
innovative in a technical sense without

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,760
getting those three foundations right

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,490
actually ends up having no impact

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,020
because at the end of the day anything

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,020
that you want to do in a regulated

00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:51,640
environment ends up being somebody

00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:53,500
decision that at best is a committee

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:56,050
based decision or the consensus based

00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,030
decision and at worst is something that

00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:59,680
isn't actually in your hands but if you

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,240
can get the three things underneath that

00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,980
there

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,020
you to make these particular types of

00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:05,550
decisions the ability to decide what to

00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,990
build how to build it

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:09,900
how to ship the product and what the

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:12,809
product could do is actually possible to

00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,309
do but the banks are constrained at the

00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:16,950
moment with the ability to do lots of

00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:18,660
the innovation that the consumers are

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,330
demanding of them and the industry is

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,740
expecting of them because of the rest

00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,040
frameworks the design of the

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,390
organization and the the structure of

00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,940
the organization in the design of the

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,500
incentives so we have a slightly

00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,960
different experience because when de

00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:36,270
Bank was assessing visto as an

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,100
investment opportunity that she started

00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,040
with the technology so they didn't like

00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,690
me much but they liked the technology

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,700
and I should the decision-making process

00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,290
under investment side walls the

00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,540
technology that twister has built over

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:50,190
the past you know four or five years how

00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,679
long is it gonna take us to build that

00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:54,530
to same technology are we able to build

00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,120
it and how much is it gonna cost us and

00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:59,100
for example the you know the people we

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,280
work with they have a budget of like 300

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,660
million euros to spend on technology so

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:05,580
they said let's actually invest you know

00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,740
five 10 million euros into twist oh and

00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,360
actually work with them as opposed to

00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,400
building the technology in house because

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,960
it is actually more expensive server

00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,600
Jake more excited about the technology

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,490
and the way we apply it to payments and

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,080
to credit and then they were thinking

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,610
about how can we actually create new

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:22,490
products in the future but should

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,870
technology was the number one driver and

00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:26,700
decision are we gonna build it in-house

00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:31,050
are we gonna buy a company who has a

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,270
technology today I'm gonna I'm gonna say

00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:35,550
that you know execution is is always as

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:37,710
necessary and an importance and so I've

00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,330
seen so many interesting ideas and

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:41,780
thoughts that ended up in slide

00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:44,490
slideshows and slide decks and and not

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:46,740
note not built in reality because the

00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:48,780
execution was lacking so I would say

00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:52,860
that of course you need to have a decent

00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:54,270
enough idea or product definition but

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,940
then you need to build it properly in

00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,429
order to to succeed and that's that's

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,140
for me always important that without the

00:22:59,429 --> 00:23:02,640
execution even the best business people

00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,400
in the world don't have anything to sell

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,530
right well if if I can bring in my

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,720
perspective in my nine years in

00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:12,030
innovation in financial services I've

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,490
probably seen about six seven thousand

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,059
pitch

00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:18,450
stakes competition participants and I

00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:21,160
generally don't care what the tech is oh

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:24,520
not at the beginning I want to know what

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,800
is the problem solving and do I have any

00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:28,120
faith in you've been able to execute and

00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:30,160
if it's not a problem solving are you

00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,620
creating your value but there needs to

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,970
be an essence and then to you me how I'm

00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,050
sure that tech was important in the

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:36,670
general business process of the

00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:38,440
investment but you guys are bringing

00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:40,120
something to the bank that the bank and

00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:41,830
it did it was Ultima love about a

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,660
problem which a technological solving

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,520
but yeah you're right I mean they don't

00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,350
look at it what kind of api's you have

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,820
actually we're interested but it was

00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:51,250
about a problem you're right and then

00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:53,440
the technology but to your point

00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:55,240
Nektarios if i can be the devil's

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,120
advocate for a second and I can speak

00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,160
not necessarily about Barclays but about

00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,320
the financial services industry as a

00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,120
whole I would argue that three things

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,510
that they have renowned for not being

00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:10,000
able to do is a understand what problem

00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:12,610
it is that they're solving be the

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,260
ability to execute and see the ability

00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:15,790
to actually figure out what value

00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,160
they're delivering so we're kind of

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:20,700
talking of slightly cross purposes when

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:22,120
banks are looking to invest in or buy a

00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,730
technology company

00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,230
they do look technology first I'm not

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,070
saying that they don't they do and if

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,929
you want the money from the bank

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,280
absolutely go and lead with the

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:32,470
technology I'm just saying that they're

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,690
wrong and that's why none of this works

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,030
and we both have lots of mutual friends

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,820
who have sold their banks near banks

00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:42,730
challenge' banks two large financial

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,830
organizations and I think every single

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:50,220
one of them we with the door closed

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:52,270
would say yes on it I think it's it's

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,970
it's kind of funny that out of all the

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:56,920
people advocating the non banking

00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:02,410
perspective is is the person who works

00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:04,300
for a bank on the planet - your call -

00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:06,940
the engineers in the room look at

00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,070
FinTech it's exciting if you're looking

00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,200
at FinTech find a frustrated banker

00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:12,970
wants to leave because he has an idea or

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,650
she has an idea because usually it's the

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:17,140
bankers who have the ideas but they

00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,480
don't have the technology skill to

00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:23,070
execute and usually looking for CTO so

00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,070
just leaving you with a thought there

00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:27,920
let's look a little bit into the future

00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,450
okay give people a perspective on our

00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:35,210
universe we are in a situation now where

00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:38,120
everybody has some understanding over 20

00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:40,010
keys in our worlds and people have had

00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,660
touch points with startups with large

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,630
corporates with technology plays in the

00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:48,650
middle if you were to think just like

00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:50,900
two three years ahead what would make a

00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:55,760
big difference to your own organization

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:58,550
where you are right now so a lot of I'll

00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,860
maybe start yeah I mean a lot of what we

00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:03,050
do in payments is driven by the existing

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:05,480
in a fraud infrastructure and what I

00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:07,490
mean by that for example in offline

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,200
payment so when you go to a store you're

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,720
expected to have a terminal on a chip a

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,640
with your contactless card Apple pay

00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,350
Google pay and actually the

00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,090
infrastructure determines the level of

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,250
innovation you can bring to the market

00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:21,200
so for example in China you don't have

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:22,550
that infrastructure but you have cameras

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,250
and you're gonna chip pay with just

00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:27,830
smiling at a camera so I think in a way

00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,570
us in the next two three years how much

00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:31,190
we can innovate the payment space is

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,530
driven by the infrastructure and

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:35,870
infrastructure in our part of the world

00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:38,270
we'll take maybe 10 15 or 20 years to

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,070
change so to be honest nothing is gonna

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,560
fundamentally change in the payment

00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:44,780
space unless the whole industry changes

00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:46,250
or the infrastructure changes but if

00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,650
you're asking what is the future of

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:50,360
Finance or how we look at it ultimately

00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,160
today we're in the age of moving to

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:53,990
cashless and having a mobile in your

00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:56,030
hand and kind of really digitalizing the

00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,950
payments experience but for us the

00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,270
future is in the biometrics so really

00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,340
paying with the smile paying with a

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,800
finger or actually not having your

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:05,390
mobile phone or wallet at all but that's

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,220
really kind of a long journey ahead of

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,200
us and we'll determine it will be

00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:11,600
determined by the infrastructure we are

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,770
operating in the market thank you all so

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,180
thank you for adding the second

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:17,330
dimension to the question so both

00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:20,330
dimensions please drew what's the second

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:23,000
dimension that you are the industry okay

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:24,080
so the first question was what would

00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,270
make the biggest difference to the

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:30,110
organisation and I think the answer is

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,760
not going to be particularly applicable

00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:33,770
because actually it's an internal thing

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,010
to the organization the ability for us

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:40,900
to be able to understand how to engage

00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:40,900
with young technology

00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,660
young and innovative technology

00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,220
companies is something that we need to

00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,260
come and meet them on their terms rather

00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:50,870
than then coming to meet us on on our

00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:52,190
terms so I think actually the ability

00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:54,500
for us to understand what those

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,690
companies how they operate the cadence

00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,070
and the rhythm in which they operate and

00:27:56,690 --> 00:28:02,120
how they actually do stuff will be the

00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:03,620
biggest thing and then kind of the the

00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,820
future of your own technology and if I

00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,200
can take it back to something I was

00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,180
saying earlier on I think that the next

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,350
wave of successful fin tech companies

00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:15,410
are going to be companies that are

00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:18,740
solving problems for banks I think that

00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,660
banks have learnt a lot about how to

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:24,020
partner in order to deliver something to

00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:27,770
a customer and those lessons that

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:29,240
they've learnt around how they can do

00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,770
that are now going to end up being

00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:32,960
applied to how they can solve the

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,000
problems that they have internally which

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,790
may be not customer facing but impact

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,550
customers as a second-order wonderful

00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:42,980
thank you yeah where is it there's a

00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:44,630
couple of things right one is when I was

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,880
figuring out scaling because we're

00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,880
getting into size status that is

00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,560
in order to retain the culture of the

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:56,380
organization it's getting more and more

00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,500
harder to embed it organically it needs

00:28:56,380 --> 00:29:02,170
to be more structuring that and and

00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:05,200
that's just a matter of a type of an

00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:06,850
organization which is growing but what

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,650
we feel is that we're probably going to

00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:13,750
move more and more into more added

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:16,030
services or added added value so for

00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,970
example you know we have sparring here

00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:20,350
as we're providing legal services for

00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:22,540
tech entrepreneurs that's something that

00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,820
two years ago we didn't do now we see a

00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,550
lot of demands that that it's we go

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:29,080
beyond engineering and more into what's

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:31,120
around it now we're doing a little bit

00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,650
of consultancy of how to build the

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,190
product how to do the visuals how to do

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:39,940
that so it's expanding that and maybe

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,070
one of the things is more focused on on

00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,790
inclusion it's for us what would we're

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:48,610
being driven about with is is building

00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:50,980
products that can bring people and give

00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:53,260
them services that they historically

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,210
didn't really have rights give credit to

00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:57,970
people they didn't have access to

00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,890
credits or or give a mortgage to people

00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,170
that didn't really have an ability to

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,240
get it and then for us maybe getting

00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:06,790
more meaning into what we're what we're

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:12,070
doing is is something that drives us

00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:14,760
forwards and as an industry but let me

00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:17,950
let me maybe stay within Central Europe

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,680
we see that there is gonna be a big need

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:23,020
for for for faster payments and instance

00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,660
payments and in the clearing of the

00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:28,000
transactions and payments in a faster

00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,800
manner and and that's maybe the number

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,710
one thing that I would say that that

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:35,020
that people should work on and do

00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:38,140
properly and figure out if there is

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:40,180
actually any value of on building on top

00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:42,610
of PSD to rights if there's anything

00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,740
that couldn't couldn't not mention we

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,150
had six more seconds and I needed to put

00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,580
it in you know it's regulation for this

00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,750
or you know

00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,270
guys we're running out of time we could

00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,920
easily just take every subject and dig a

00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:56,200
lot deeper and the people on the stage

00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,730
actually have the ability to dig deeper

00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,320
which is wonderful so thank you very

00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,890
much for making the time I hope this was

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,450
insightful

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:02,230
I hope this managed to give you an

00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,970
insight

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,770
on the world who operates in and the

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,540
challenges we're facing but also give

00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,950
you a little glimmers of hope that is

00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,750
actually working when it works

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,250
beautifully so thank you very much

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:13,290
everybody thanks to a panel thank you

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:16,450
for listening thank you

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,450
