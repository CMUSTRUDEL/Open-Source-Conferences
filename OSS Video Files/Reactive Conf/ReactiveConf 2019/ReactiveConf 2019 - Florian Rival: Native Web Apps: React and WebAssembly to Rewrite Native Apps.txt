Can React and web technologies compete with native toolkits when it comes to making super complex, rich desktop apps? Can we go further and create better-than-native applications?? Sounds like a good challenge

This talk introduces how React, JavaScript and WebAssembly can be used to write new ambitious apps, or port existing ones – with the real-world example of my open-source game development software. I’ll show how to leverage the React ecosystem to create performant applications: architecture, patterns, typing, useful open-source modules… and how to go one step further and provide a better user experience as well as a better developer experience.

These apps are not web apps, they are not native apps, they are hybrid “Native Web Apps” and can provide the best of both worlds.
