When you’re building a component library or a design system, you’d want to visualize how the growing number of components look in their different states and variations. One way to achieve this would be writing every possible variation of the component by hand. This is a manual process, harder to maintain and means a lot of lines of code. What do we all have in common as developers? We hate all those 3 things.
In this talk, you’ll find out how you can automate your component variation rendering process and improve your workflow by applying the Cartesian Component concept. The code will be presented in React but the concept is applicable to the components written in other frameworks as well
