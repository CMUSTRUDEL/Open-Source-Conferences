Title: ReactiveConf 2019 - Amr Abdelwahab: Privilege as a Technical Debt

Discovery stage
-------------------------------------------------------------------
elonging to an underrepresented group in the European tech scene myself, I most of the times struggle with colleagues who undervalue the principles of diversity and empathy.

I realised that these topics are rarely debated within the tech scene logically and pragmatically without pointing fingers.

Do you believe political correctness and empathy are buzzwords that limit the society rather than contribute to its advancement? Do you think talking about topics like diversity quotas, privilege doesn’t make much sense and you would rather spend this time talking about the latest in technology?

In this talk I would like to take the chance to try and add the missing contexts to such terms and arguments, moreover, I will try to go through various examples on how it can impact your product from a very pragmatic prospective.

You can find below a rough outline of the presentation:

[Music]

00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:18,390
yeah so you need to wake up I know that

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:20,640
this day is starting and I'm also sleepy

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:24,330
by the way so if you feel sleepy feel

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,400
free to sleep like don't worry I always

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:28,169
like to start like my presentations with

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,790
like weird things like I tell you a

00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:31,890
story I did this like public speaking

00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,780
course I think that was in university

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,730
times and there they speak about like

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,780
different stages of every presentation

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,940
where you have to have like this

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,860
introduction body clean sure whatever

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,850
and there is this section that's cool

00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,580
like attention-grabber

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,050
and this is basically about this like

00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,790
how the speaker gets on the stage and

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,110
tries to like grabs everyone attention

00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,700
in the room right so you would find

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,410
people like asking a question that's

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,320
like kind of the traditional way or

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:57,120
popping like a story and I was talking

00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,890
to Jessica actually I was telling her

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,630
like yeah I used to do this thing where

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,010
I would bring like this big prop on the

00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,420
stage and just put it there and people

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:07,470
are like what is he gonna do with it and

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,630
just do nothing so but then like on a

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,150
darker note I moved to Europe in 2013

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,280
and something weird started to happen

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,170
because being a person of color having

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,899
this sort of hair having my body sighs

00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:20,219
you have enough attention in the streets

00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:26,039
and stage that you don't need that

00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:28,469
anymore yeah so as mentioned my name is

00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:31,229
Hamid Rahab super-hard name don't worry

00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:33,270
about that I am basically a software

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:36,299
engineer like most of the people in the

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,340
room here right I mostly come from the

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,799
Ruby community I do mostly back-end so I

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,100
am not so much on the reactive side of

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,630
things and like before starting my talk

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,889
or before starting any talk I gave in

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:49,319
the past I usually try to say this

00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:50,639
sentence over the years over my 12 years

00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,490
in this industry I learned one thing

00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:55,679
people and community matter the most so

00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,299
regardless of how technical excellence

00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:59,429
is important which is really important

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,619
right but we are still building things

00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:02,789
with people for people so communities

00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,689
and people matter the most

00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:09,690
I was born and raised in Cairo in North

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,790
Africa and then in 2015 I moved to your

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,240
neighboring country hungry lived in

00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:17,130
Budapest for a bit and then lately in

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,810
2017 I moved to your other neighboring

00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:23,610
country Germany and I live in Berlin so

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,140
before I start I mean I was even asking

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,860
myself this question like why do I need

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,500
to give this tour

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,850
and why me right it's important to

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,680
mention that this is not going to be an

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,830
expert talk so I'm not here to give you

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,090
like an expert opinion about the topic

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:37,680
that's not the case it's more of a talk

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,450
of my heart right like it was more like

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,750
afferent from your fellow developer to

00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,910
some fellow developers and as much as

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,320
many people always consider these kind

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,660
of talks to be irrelevant on these

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,240
stages right it's very relevant because

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,740
it impacts the life of myself probably

00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,600
hundreds of thousands of your colleagues

00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,130
and as I will try to show you later it

00:02:54,600 --> 00:03:00,120
also impacts your product it impacts

00:02:56,130 --> 00:03:02,820
your output as well the second thing is

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,380
why specifically me is giving this talk

00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,300
at the moment I think I have this

00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,370
interesting thing where I have this two

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,230
sides of the of the coin let's as they

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,790
say so I come from this kind of

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:13,290
privileged background my parents are

00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,590
kind of middle to high class Egyptian

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,060
family and they they are Muslim so I

00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,100
belong to the Muslim community which is

00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,910
in Egypt as is a privilege on its own

00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:26,280
and said sadly to say that I have the

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,870
lighter shade of black which is in North

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,670
Africa still considered the privileged

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,450
compared to the darker ones like my

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,310
brother for example I don't know I'm

00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:36,930
straight cisgender male so I was

00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,540
checking all these boxes basically I was

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,720
checking all the boxes and I remember in

00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,220
the past like before moving to Europe I

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,050
was confronted by people sometimes right

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,209
like people from the Christian community

00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:50,160
in Egypt or the LGBT friends or women

00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:53,280
they would start to complain about

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,350
things and I felt sympathy simply feel

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,970
like I was really feeling sad but deep

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,680
deep inside I had always this question

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:01,440
why are those people so sensitive about

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,850
this topic right like why are they

00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,470
making a big fuss why do we have to

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:08,220
bring this question in every single

00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:09,780
conversation we have to talk and I have

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,820
to admit I fell a lot for these

00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,470
fallacies like repeating things without

00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,360
really understanding them and thinking

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,830
that oh I am so smart I cracked it and

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,709
those people are just not smart enough

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,510
to understand what I understand now and

00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,520
then I move Europe in 2015 as I

00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,380
mentioned and there is this moment where

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,900
you start to feel like everyday people

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,400
are just looking down to you without you

00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,660
changing nothing right so it you were

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,510
like somewhere and now you're somewhere

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,460
else and you don't understand I mean

00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,080
this statement here you need to do ten

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:38,820
times more effort to achieve the same

00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,540
result it's a statement that was told to

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,010
me by my

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:43,080
manager at some point he was like you're

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,630
a brown person you need to do this ten

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,280
ten times more to the people accepts it

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:51,210
and he was not saying this as an advice

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,190
I was facing things that today I am

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,110
calling racist behaviors everywhere all

00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:57,390
the time at the beginning I did not call

00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,070
him like that right I was questioning

00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:01,140
myself maybe I am the one now that's

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,480
becoming this oversensitive person right

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:05,910
or maybe I'm doing something wrong maybe

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:07,560
I still cannot at the apt or whatsoever

00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,350
you start to question yourself actually

00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,730
before you actually question the others

00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,350
so I was like okay this is not a new

00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,330
topic right I'm not reinventing the

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,400
wheel like there is hundreds of years of

00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:19,290
literature and universities and

00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,060
faculties and people doing stuff about

00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,040
that read about it try to do some

00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,600
research and then that was the moment

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,280
you realize that your whole life you are

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,020
just missing the context you're just

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,930
looking at the problem as if it's a

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:33,720
mathematical problem while it's not so I

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,490
decided that I need to come to

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,710
conferences like this or meetups and try

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,020
to target individuals who like myself in

00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:42,030
the past today are unintentionally

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,110
damaging their peers and in-system is

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,820
unintentionally because if you

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,020
intentionally damage someone you're not

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,730
welcomed in this room you're not

00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:52,290
welcomed in this community so please

00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:54,180
leave and I will try as much as I can in

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:58,140
the next few minutes to add as much

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,760
context to this topic right so the

00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,170
presentation will go through different

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,960
steps at the beginning I will try to

00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,620
speak from like what is privileged try

00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,520
to give you like some arguments and

00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,200
fallacious arguments and how to answer

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:11,790
them then I will try to focus on the

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,530
pragmatic aspect and how does it impact

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,530
your product and then I will try to give

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,540
you some tips so the question of

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,980
privilege people like to do this weird

00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:21,720
thing in presentations where they put

00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,060
like this Wikipedia definition then they

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,820
start to read it loudly and slowly and

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,010
like this never works and especially

00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,050
when it's about social sciences never

00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:33,210
ever check dictionary definitions

00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,730
because it's wrong because they just

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,410
simply ignores the context so I was

00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,930
trying to come up okay how can I explain

00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,820
to people in a simpler way very overly

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,470
simplified way what is a privilege right

00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:45,150
so I was like I came up with this game

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,990
so try in your brain now to calculate

00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:50,700
your privilege score so if you can at

00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:52,650
any moment just take up take out your

00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,460
phone now and like write on Twitter or

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,740
Facebook any

00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,610
post whatsoever you want without ending

00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,710
up being in jail murdered in exile

00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:03,240
that's a plus one for yourself let me

00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,210
tell you a quick story I come from Egypt

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,280
and just in the past one month there are

00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,970
more than 3,000 people arrested for

00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,020
Facebook posts 3,000 people that's

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:15,150
triple the amount of people in this

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,500
conference just being in jail right now

00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:21,210
because they wrote something on Facebook

00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,069
if you can go to someone at any moment

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:25,650
and say I love you right I am a straight

00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,900
person so I get a plus one here but

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,900
imagine imagine being an LGBT community

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,509
member in Russia or in Egypt or in many

00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,039
other countries you still today get

00:07:33,509 --> 00:07:36,750
murdered right you still today get

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,699
prosecuted for that that's a privilege

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:43,320
you're not aware because you just go to

00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:45,240
sell people I love you very commonly in

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,509
software conferences there is this talk

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,699
about remote work and digital nomadic

00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,560
and what so ever and then in my brain is

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:55,620
almost computing to like give me a visa

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,599
and I will do that right so this is a

00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,310
privilege like just your ability to work

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,690
wherever you want and live wherever you

00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:02,610
want and all this kind of thing is a

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:04,320
privilege right people are not as

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,169
welcomed as you are everywhere and

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,030
you're not aware of that another example

00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,520
is if you have Muhammad as your second

00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:13,590
name as I do you are always for some

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,240
reason selected randomly in the random

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:19,199
selections of the security of the

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:21,030
airport I don't know I can keep going on

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,639
with this list I don't know it until

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:25,500
tomorrow but in a nutshell what I'm

00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,090
trying to say here is that privilege is

00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,190
not something that's set in stone I

00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:30,840
privilege changes based on the context

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:32,760
it's very coupled to its context so as I

00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,740
said being part of the Muslim community

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,880
in Egypt is a privilege but here it's

00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:41,039
not privilege is very intersectional so

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,479
you checking one of the boxes or under

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,279
checking one of the boxes is not enough

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,230
because you bring for example a white

00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:48,420
woman you are still more privileged than

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,610
a black woman of course much less

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,560
privileged than a white man and you

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,180
cannot just ignore one aspect of

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,649
privilege at a time we cannot say I am

00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,270
only defending women or I'm only

00:08:55,649 --> 00:08:59,310
defending black people it's all

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:02,430
intersecting you cannot ignore one

00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,990
aspect over the other but the most

00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,010
important thing of this talk is that

00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,680
when I'm calling you privileged and not

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:12,880
you evil so privilege is not something

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:15,040
that is evil privilege is simply the

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,960
statement that you need to do extra

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,940
efforts or you have some extra duties

00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,210
that you need to do and then the

00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:24,250
question always pops up here wait I did

00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:27,160
nothing wrong I was just born into this

00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,510
why do I need to do more efforts and let

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,220
me ask you a question who here is

00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:35,020
maintaining a legacy code base or used

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:37,660
to do it in the past I mean I think

00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,820
majority of us at some point inherited

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,020
some project from someone and you need

00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,030
to think that when you inherit this

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,710
project you know for sure that the

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,330
previous developers did their best like

00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:48,160
you know that they tried to do the best

00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,500
for this project and they try to build I

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,540
don't know cool stuff but in some

00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:54,760
situations someone from the business

00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,350
came to them and said we need this as

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,000
fast as possible I don't know hack it

00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,500
somehow so they had to build this in

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,290
complete solutions because the business

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,840
asks for it or I don't know they cannot

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:06,340
anticipate the future so they built they

00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:09,370
took some uninformed decision and they

00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:11,200
built something that is not good or they

00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,410
just came to reactive conf and some

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,840
person was speaking about I don't know

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,730
microservices or server list or MongoDB

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,960
or whatsoever there and then they just

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,940
wanted to follow a high product

00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,850
understanding which I'm pretty sure all

00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,680
of you are familiar with the situation

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:28,420
this here introduces what all of us in

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,430
this room agree to call technical debt

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,630
right it's not something that you did

00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,340
it's something the people in the past

00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,810
did everyone in this room agrees with

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,090
this and when you are dealing with

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,040
technical debt you cannot simply ignore

00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:40,150
it right you cannot say oh nothing

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,220
happened in the past I will just keep

00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,300
shipping I don't care and then you end

00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:45,880
up with a code base that's not

00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,350
maintainable in like two weeks you also

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:48,730
cannot rewrite everything from the

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:51,490
beginning because then you will end up

00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,890
rewriting everything every week the way

00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,480
to deal with technical depth is simple

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,700
you keep shipping you keep moving

00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:01,390
forward but you have to be mindful of

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:05,460
what happened in the past so try to

00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:07,600
imagine there is a 200,000 years project

00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:08,230
billions of developers have worked on

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,610
this project

00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:14,740
and unlike your software projects they

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:17,440
had Hitler not everyone was like having

00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:19,690
the best intentions right so everything

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,250
is super coupled everything is complex

00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:23,590
everything is badly documented

00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,460
everything is not secure and there are

00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:29,140
no automated tests I mean obviously this

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,640
project exists and we are all

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:32,320
maintaining this right like we are all

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,940
maintaining this humanity well we all

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,830
inherited this project we need to keep

00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:39,430
shipping but we need to keep being

00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,020
mindful of what happened in the past one

00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:43,360
last thing about the definition is this

00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,250
industry this industry really tends to

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,260
remove the context I understand this in

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:49,780
code I understand that you want to have

00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,240
single responsibilities like objects

00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:54,850
that make sense in code you want to have

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,250
isolated the coupled decoupled services

00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,750
that make sense in your coding word you

00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,730
want to have technology agnostic

00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,440
platform agnostic whatever I put before

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:05,020
agnostic I don't know developers really

00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,530
love it but this does not apply to

00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:10,570
social sciences you cannot go and say ah

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,950
one plus one equal two it doesn't work

00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,360
like that there is context and you need

00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,610
to understand it in order to be able to

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,080
analyze anything so in the next section

00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,530
I will try to focus on some of these

00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:25,360
arguments that very very very often I

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,620
mean people who use it use it on daily

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,140
basis and they think that they are so

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,180
smart and that they crack the code the

00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,590
other thing is that sadly sometimes it

00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,750
can happen from even under privileged

00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,810
people that can be a talk on its own why

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,790
does that happen but let's start with

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,890
the first one intention versus impact I

00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:44,050
think it's very common when someone

00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:46,270
complains about racist sexist

00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:48,430
transphobic behavior in any situation

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,770
the answer is always he did not mean it

00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:55,180
I don't know why he always did not mean

00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,740
it and he here is intentional intention

00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:59,860
is not really relevant when you're

00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,480
damaging someone let me tell you this I

00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,580
don't really care about you being racist

00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,740
or not racist I care that what you just

00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,350
did is an act of racism I don't really

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,240
care about you as a person let's think

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,920
about this example you are in a park and

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,870
you're throwing a frisbee if it hits my

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,760
face and got me concussion you still

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,560
need to apologize and you still need to

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,220
take me to the hospital regardless of

00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,830
you meant it or not on the other hand

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,230
many people I'm sure many people in the

00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,460
software industry do good things but

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,460
they don't understand why for example

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,830
let's go to women who code and try to

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,300
support their and try to coach their

00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:35,440
if you don't understand if you think

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,330
that you're doing this because you are

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,220
nice then you are missing the point you

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,780
are doing this because it's important

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,570
you're doing this because you are a big

00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:45,100
part of this problem right so it's very

00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:47,560
important to understand why are you

00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,150
doing good things as well not just doing

00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,500
them because everyone else is saying

00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:55,390
it's cool the second thing is I don't

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,820
know if anyone here heard about this

00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,860
black lives matter campaign that was in

00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,810
the US couple of years ago so it was

00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,790
basically a response to the American

00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,080
police killing much more black people

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,780
that's statistical fact

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,370
right there was this other campaign an

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,260
opposing campaign that said all lives

00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,820
matter it's not just black lives people

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,280
that matter and all this kind of stuff

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:17,410
black lives matter was not about the

00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:19,000
fact that like black people are more

00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:21,400
important that was never the intention

00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,320
they're right the intention there was

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,500
trying to point out that the thing that

00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,870
black lives people are not like

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,640
relatively undervalued in the u.s. they

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,350
are trying to point out the statistical

00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,360
issue and they are trying to push the

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:37,330
country to recognize this inequity and

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,860
perhaps bring it to an end maybe a good

00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:43,480
way to think of it is this black lives

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:47,040
matter to I think this maybe would sum

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,040
up what I'm trying to say in this

00:14:51,509 --> 00:14:56,410
why am I saying this I mean this is

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,240
obviously like a very political very non

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,699
related thing you have no idea how

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,589
relevant this is to our reality every

00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:04,240
single day because every single woman I

00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:07,000
have seen in my life complaining to a

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,410
male colleague about an issue from the

00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,209
manager he's always complaining with

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,899
things like how we are all under the

00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:17,110
same oppression no you are not you just

00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,730
simply don't know no you're not you

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,769
might think that you are under the same

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,300
but you are not the same goes for a

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:26,949
white person when you tell him something

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,660
no you are not sadly I don't have time

00:15:26,949 --> 00:15:30,220
to show this video but I will share the

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,660
slides so you can check this video later

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,639
it's amazing about the concept of

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:35,199
microaggressions so we will have to go

00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,029
through this the last argument I want to

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,220
mention is this argument of this is

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,410
being racist against white people or

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,970
this being sexist against men this

00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,889
person here is saying like being a

00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:47,379
straight heterosexual male on Twitter in

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:50,370
2018 is harder than it was being openly

00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:52,600
homosexual in the u.s. in 1960s a

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,459
perfect example of how you remove

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,250
context from a privilege to her argument

00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,569
right because I have never and please

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,910
tell me if you have ever heard about

00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,889
this heard about a straight male being

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,379
murdered or arrested for the safe or the

00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:07,540
case of being a straight male never

00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:12,250
happened but this is still happening

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:13,750
today in our world I think maybe it

00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,339
always reminds me of like a British

00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,300
person coming to me and saying it's not

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:18,790
fair that they don't have an

00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:19,769
Independence Day it doesn't work like

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,930
this

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:25,059
so no it's not racism against white

00:16:22,930 --> 00:16:26,410
people or sexism against men because it

00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:28,240
doesn't have an attached historical

00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:30,309
baggage there is no history there to

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,079
support this claim there is no power

00:16:30,309 --> 00:16:33,670
imbalance there is all that always has

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,879
to be this power imbalance to be cool

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,199
oppression and to sum it up what I'm

00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,180
trying to say is that we are not trying

00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,319
to seek giving everyone equal attention

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,660
this is not what you're trying to say

00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:45,579
what we are trying to seek is giving

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,709
everyone equity and liberation maybe

00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:50,860
this is a good way to also explain this

00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:52,209
and eventually we should be able to

00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:56,019
knock out this wall and all feel

00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:57,879
liberated and move on so that was it

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:00,339
about the ethical part let's say but is

00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:01,839
it only a question of ethics there is a

00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:04,030
question of pragmatism here there is a

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,780
question of a value added to your

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,680
product

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,540
I started to in the next few slides to

00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:12,339
show you like some examples of how much

00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:14,650
impact does this thing have on your

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,260
products the famous last name issue

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:19,720
which is so not famous so if I ask

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,640
anyone who's a back-end engineer in the

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,650
world including myself at some points

00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,600
how would you model a user in the

00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,189
database the answer always includes the

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,860
fields first name last name email

00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:31,780
password whatsoever there is a very

00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,520
clear implicit assumption there that

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,080
every single person that will use your

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,110
application has a first and the last

00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,000
name and this assumption is a perfect

00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:42,580
example for what's called the false

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,220
consensus effect false consensus effect

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,990
is a cognitive bias where we as people

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,790
tend to think that everyone else has the

00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:50,620
same habits have the same thoughts have

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,910
the same we always think the same we

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:54,220
always think that our we are just like

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:57,400
everyone else I will start with a

00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:00,220
surprise I don't have a last name so as

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,810
one hundred million Egyptians we have a

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,100
totally different naming conventions and

00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,660
I'm pretty sure there are other nations

00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,240
in the world that have the same problem

00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:09,550
and this might seem like very trivial to

00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:12,070
you but you have no idea how much issues

00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:13,420
I ran into the past because of the fact

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,010
that I don't have a last name and I have

00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:17,590
to make up some last name from my

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,270
passport and go through this hell that

00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,610
the bank doesn't accept this as the last

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:25,360
name and whatsoever just because you

00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:27,340
wanted to split the name in the database

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,630
I don't know why but you wouldn't have

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,900
even thought of that because you don't

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,640
have someone diverse to tell you that

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,980
there is this amazing github repo called

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,320
the awesome falsehood of programming I

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,360
somehow I can't really watch it so much

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,340
because it makes me so sad because like

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,800
we all do these things on daily basis

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:49,000
excluding so many people over super

00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:51,430
trivial unnecessary things the second

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,560
thing is the racist camera phenomenon

00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:55,060
and I don't know if you have ever came

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:57,430
across any of those but there are a lot

00:18:55,060 --> 00:19:00,040
of these like videos that tries to show

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:02,140
how cameras deal with races or how face

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,480
recognition algorithms deal with races

00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:06,790
for example this this photo here where

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,850
Nick on camera looks at Adrian people

00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,620
and says that did someone blink or this

00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:13,480
video here that sadly I also have to

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,730
skip that but this video is about HP

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,560
face recognition with a black person so

00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,870
it cannot it can only recognize why

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,950
people but how I mean how did that

00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,870
happen I don't really believe that

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,720
technology's racist technology does not

00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:28,480
have feelings right the story is like

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,100
this this lady here this beautiful lady

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,410
is called Shirley she used to be the

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,690
model of Kodak in the 50s and this here

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:37,000
is called the Shirley card which used to

00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:39,450
be the standard color reference card for

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,370
the photography industry in the 50s

00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:44,560
important thing to note here this was an

00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:46,840
intentional thing this did not happen by

00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,000
a mistake in the 50s they had this

00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,350
meeting and they asked themselves do we

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,910
really want to invest time into

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:53,440
including black people and the answer

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:56,070
was well black people can't afford to

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,440
buy cameras why try to involve them

00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:01,750
today we are screening in 2019 we don't

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,190
even use films anymore we have digital

00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,920
cameras but we still have the

00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,170
implications of that from that time and

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,060
even though so many efforts are done by

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:11,610
companies to fix this this is still not

00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:14,440
fixed

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:17,290
one last example is the mysterious case

00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,660
of sexist airbags who here knows that

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:22,000
when airbags were first released they

00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,730
were less safe for children and women in

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,920
comparison to men and this happened the

00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:28,960
game before exactly the same reason the

00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,210
old male engineers team thought about

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,970
the idea of taking the average height

00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:35,680
and weight to make test dummies ignoring

00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,780
completely that there are other sizes of

00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:40,750
people outside this room which ended up

00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:42,340
into this tragic outcome which actually

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,220
is a void product as a product that does

00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,570
not even do its job what I'm trying to

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:48,730
say here is you need to think about

00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,440
these things in every stage right I

00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,420
mentioned an example of development I

00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:54,370
mentioned an example of testing a mentor

00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,190
she mentioned an example of business and

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,690
Jessica earlier was speaking about

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,010
things that light relates to design and

00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:04,660
including people with a been like

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:05,950
ableism with able disability sorry so

00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,470
you need to think about that at every

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,690
stage and sadly you cannot achieve that

00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:13,360
unless you have enough diversity in your

00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:15,130
team because false consensus people if

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,550
people are all the same they will not

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:22,990
see beyond the things that they are all

00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:25,420
accustomed to so yeah what to do now as

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,610
a company what you need to do is

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,830
recognize this issue this issue exists

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:31,090
this issue can damage your product this

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,980
issue can

00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:36,100
have a bad impact on your return of

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,419
investment higher diversity professional

00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,059
because actually those people exist

00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:42,730
right this is not like I think that

00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:45,009
doesn't exist this exists and stop this

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,120
behavior of it's called pinkwashing I

00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:47,980
don't know if someone heard this term

00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,259
before but where you would put like an

00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,899
LGBT logo but your product is still

00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:54,850
excluding LGBT people right stop trying

00:21:52,899 --> 00:21:56,950
to capitalize over helping minorities

00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,899
while you are as a company is the main

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,059
them in like one of the main factors

00:21:58,899 --> 00:22:03,429
damaging them try to actually do

00:22:01,059 --> 00:22:04,659
something for them try to listen when

00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:06,850
you have an employee that's under

00:22:04,659 --> 00:22:08,320
privileged and complaining because when

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,789
they speak they speak out of something

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,249
it's not they are not just trying to

00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:15,039
 they really have something that

00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,419
they can tell you make sure to guarantee

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,549
this open and transparent communication

00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:20,499
framework for such issues specifically

00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:22,409
have code of conduct try to have this

00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:25,210
talk with your employees all the time

00:22:22,409 --> 00:22:26,830
and most importantly stop shutting down

00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:29,649
the conversation this conversation is

00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,119
very important to have I have seen so

00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:32,559
many companies so scared of this

00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,539
conversation that once it comes up

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,460
they're just like let's let's hide it

00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:38,110
let's try to like put it under the rug

00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,779
and not talk about it talk about these

00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:43,450
things it's very important as us as

00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:45,580
people who work for companies you need

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,049
to recognize the fact that you being a

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,409
software engineer is on its own a

00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:52,929
privilege right recognize this privilege

00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:55,869
and and understand that we you work in a

00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:57,490
candidate driven market most of us can

00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:00,460
easily find jobs compared to other

00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:03,700
professions right most of us are highly

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,129
paid so try to use this and also be very

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,929
humble stop this attitude of thinking

00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:10,389
that you're so smart because you're not

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:13,419
be humble and try to listen to people

00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:15,669
when they tell you stuff important you

00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:17,619
are not as smart as you think I am not

00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:20,860
as smart as I think none of us in this

00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:22,929
room is smart as you think so do your

00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,059
homework try to study try to research

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:26,559
try to read more before you just give

00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:28,779
judgment and when you understand

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,450
something speak up for yourself for

00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,009
others around you for people in the

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:36,820
warehouse in your company that are being

00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:39,039
exploited not just for yourself as that

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,600
community member support all these

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,250
diversity related initiatives right I

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,320
mentioned already woman who called rails

00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,120
girls Django girls

00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:47,760
there are plenty that also targets I

00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,380
don't know people of color refugees try

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,150
to support these initiatives but as I

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,830
mentioned before make sure to understand

00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:55,440
why are you supporting these initiatives

00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,880
not because you are cool but because you

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,790
are solving a problem that you are part

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,010
of make sure to write about the topic

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:04,460
make sure to speak in conferences and

00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,870
meetups push this conversation forward

00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:10,020
most importantly if you're a white male

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:12,540
learn your role you are an ally you are

00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:14,370
not the plac you are not a victim you

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,870
are an ally and understand what does it

00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:25,140
mean and what does it entail to be an

00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:27,680
ally okay cool so two things I would

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:30,540
like to like talk about before leaving

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,370
there is this statement that really gets

00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,680
on my nerves when people say things like

00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:36,090
but why don't we all just be nice to

00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,700
each others and move on from this

00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:41,090
conversation why do we have to make a

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,500
fuss about it as I was saying before I

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:45,450
hope that you understand that your

00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,250
ability to be sick of politics your

00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:51,000
ability to live this politics free life

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:52,950
is just a privilege in action right your

00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,950
privileges is the thing that allows you

00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,810
to live this politics free life because

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,690
you're less likely to be a target of

00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:04,620
bigotry attacks deportation exile murder

00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:06,720
much much much danger like very very

00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:08,790
dangerous things you're less likely to

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,680
be a target of and that's why you don't

00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:12,180
see that your safety is not at stake so

00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:16,140
you think that we can just move on and

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:19,230
be nice the second thing is this I think

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:22,770
that you are playing the victim card why

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:24,420
to get the diversity ticket so I don't

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,340
know I hope you also understand that

00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,770
it's really hard and exhausting to bring

00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:30,750
up the topics of oppression before

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:32,160
giving this talk I had to think so much

00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:33,510
because I was always giving like

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,120
technical talks and people were like

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:38,010
yeah this is this guy's cool but I had

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,720
to think so much before should I really

00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:42,090
face people and tell them what I feel

00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,710
because it's hard it's exhausting for me

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:45,270
and for other people that are

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,280
underrepresented much more than it is

00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,690
for you

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:51,630
we know that the styrene we know that's

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,370
annoying but at the end we are fighting

00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:56,070
for life and safety we are not fighting

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:58,259
for stuff as you think

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,659
so if you don't see that this is about

00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:03,389
our lives and safety it simply is

00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:05,000
because of your privileges again thank

00:26:03,389 --> 00:26:08,020
you

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,869
[Applause]

00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,869
