Open-source modules on the NPM ecosystem are undoubtedly awesome. However, they also represent an undeniable and massive risk. You’re introducing someone else’s code into your system, often with little or no scrutiny. The wrong package can introduce severe vulnerabilities into your application, exposing your application and your user’s data. This talk will use a sample application, Goof, which uses various vulnerable dependencies, which we will exploit as an attacker would. For each issue, we’ll explain why it happened, show its impact, and – most importantly – see how to avoid or fix it.

I believe the Stranger Danger talk would fit really well on the Security track, and I can add more of my own input and flavor to it from my workaround open source security with the work I’m doing in the Node.js Security WG too.

With all, that’s been happening in the security field and that has been affecting javascript developers, whether they are on the frontend or backend, I believe the security talk would be awesome as it includes a lot of live hacking too.
