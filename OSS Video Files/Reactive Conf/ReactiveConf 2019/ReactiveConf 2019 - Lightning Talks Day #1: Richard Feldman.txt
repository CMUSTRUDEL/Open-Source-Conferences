all right welcome everyone this is

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,570
distributed markdown apps I'm Richard

00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:24,640
Feldman so like many people I have a

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,070
blog which I don't write for very often

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,539
and also like many people I know what

00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,769
you're supposed to do right now if you

00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:31,960
have a blog which is to say you're

00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,820
supposed to self hosts get off of medium

00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,350
and off these platforms that take all

00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,120
your monetization opportunities away

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,680
from you and you know what I'm gonna get

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,720
on board that train I I know it's time

00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,129
I'm gonna self host I'm gonna build my

00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,870
own stack and I'm gonna put Artie

00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:46,420
Feldman calm on there are my own stuff

00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:47,739
that I coded which immediately leads to

00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,180
the next question that will I will do

00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,769
instead of writing blog post which is

00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,470
figure out what is my tech stack going

00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:54,640
to be now I'm thinking like okay I know

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,750
there's all this stuff out there that's

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,040
like really really cool but you know

00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,510
what I don't want over engineers I want

00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,830
to keep it super simple so I'm just

00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,019
gonna start with just markdown like

00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,010
plain ol markdown like markdowns great

00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:05,110
you know you write stuff really

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,490
concisely really nice-looking code and

00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:08,440
spits out stuff that looks really nice

00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,850
it's it's really great for static

00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,590
content and this is a blog that's all

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,870
I'm doing static content here cool

00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,150
markdown it is so I'm thinking about

00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:17,620
text accent like how my stuff renders

00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,150
and I realized you know so I use this

00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,580
thing called instant paper anybody here

00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,050
use instant paper yeah okay so it's a

00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,240
couple people it's basically something

00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,980
where you get to look at articles in the

00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,080
style that I want like it's all about it

00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,940
looking at somebody else's content using

00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:33,340
my style as the reader so it's about

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,570
taking somebody's content putting the

00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,400
readers style on it rather than the

00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:37,600
author's style and now what I'm thinking

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,030
about this from the perspective of an

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,190
author I'm like that's like kind of like

00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:43,750
that but also kind of don't cuz like I

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,520
mean I put all this thought into how my

00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,409
blog post is gonna look and the style

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,330
the look and feel of it it's kind of an

00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:50,890
expression of my personality like you

00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,210
know I like to have the title be green

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,440
because I like the color green it like

00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,270
goes with my hair you know and stuff

00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,680
like that it's it's like I want that to

00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,670
kind of come through for the reader and

00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,960
I don't really don't want them to

00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,760
override all that like what if they

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,140
don't care about the title what if like

00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,820
instant paper could have like a default

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,590
style and say like okay though the

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:06,670
author gets to say this is the default

00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,319
and then the reader can override

00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,179
whatever they don't care about so maybe

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,190
my personality can come through just in

00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:13,180
the title but not in everything I think

00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,130
that'd be kind of nice maybe that's a

00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:17,200
nice feature suggestion for Instapaper

00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,209
anyway enough of that distraction let's

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,739
let's think about this this blogging

00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:22,090
engine so I'm thinking about this one

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,440
like you know I'm gonna want to spice

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,510
this up though I'm not just gonna want

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,040
to have plain ol blog post someone add a

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,200
little bit of spice to the end each one

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,519
I want to add a random Douglas Adams's

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,319
quote to the end of each blog post

00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:33,970
something like this but its end at the

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,069
end each blog post is just a nice

00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:38,260
Douglas Adams's well it'll be randomly

00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,790
selected and I'm like I'm a programmer I

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,590
don't want to do this by hand copy paste

00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,760
like find a quote each time no I don't

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,650
want to have just like a repository of

00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,480
quotes and have my system I just

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,430
automatically inject one at the end of

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,290
each post that's only okay well what

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:51,970
what technology should I used then I'm

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,230
like again don't over engineer it don't

00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,269
want to get too of a complicated scribe

00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,010
a script for it you know bash is great

00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,079
for small scripts and that's all I need

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,579
and then I'm like okay but now now I'm

00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,959
thinking about how am I gonna monetize

00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,730
this thing is when I'm writing all these

00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,560
blog posts they're gonna get millions

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,299
and millions of views I know this and so

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,250
I'm gonna want to monetize all those all

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:10,720
those views so I'm thinking okay I'm

00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,060
gonna sell t-shirts that's like the best

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,040
way to monetize a blog obviously RT

00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,010
filmon.com t-shirts you know come into a

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,480
store near you but by store I mean like

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,250
I'm just gonna put on some online thing

00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,079
as I'm looking around at these like

00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,269
online stores I'm like me and all these

00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:27,280
checkout systems like they want to take

00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:28,510
a cut of my money it's just like media

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,100
man they just they just want to take

00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,079
some of my monetization away from me

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,700
forget that I'm gonna roll my own I'm

00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:36,430
gonna build my own checkout system for

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:38,290
my t-shirts for my blog because that's

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:39,579
that's the whole point of all of this so

00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,989
am i cool I'm gonna I'm gonna like make

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,100
a shopping cart and then of course the

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,720
next question is like well if I'm

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,220
building my own shopping cart what's the

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,810
tech stack gonna be for my shopping cart

00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,160
and it's not like alright alright

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,389
alright well look I don't I don't want

00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,650
to go and like get some really fancy

00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:52,000
thing I already got this good thing

00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,040
going you know I already got marked down

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,389
for my static content check out some

00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,280
mostly static content like what are the

00:03:55,389 --> 00:03:59,739
prices what are the images and then I'm

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,209
like well and then also you know I got

00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,739
bashed for my little small scripts I

00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:04,630
could use that to make things dynamic

00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,400
and I'm like oh and actually I can make

00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,900
things dynamic on the fly that's like

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,000
how we used to do on the web back in the

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,639
day right like if I combine March down

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,010
for the static content and bash like as

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,539
I get the HTTP requests dynamically

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,280
decide which markdown to render into

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:19,750
HTML to send to the client boom I got

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,789
dynamic content I don't even need to

00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,220
change stacks so then I'm like cool

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:25,780
except oh wait a minute wait a minute I

00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,890
forgot I forgot one piece which is like

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,090
as my shopping cart gets more

00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,820
complicated the Styles get more

00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:32,460
complicated and I'm like

00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,600
okay so like how am I gonna deal with

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,680
all these different styles that are

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,210
going on this is like a lot more

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
complicated than what markdown can do

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,270
but then I remember my instant paper

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,190
idea with the like default sires and

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,230
reader sounds like cool all these ideas

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,390
it's all coming together this is great

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,800
if I put markdown and instant pay for

00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,410
and bash together I can fill the whole

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,450
app this is a great stack and then this

00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,420
is when I get the like galaxy brain

00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:57,240
amazing idea I'm like this is not only a

00:04:54,420 --> 00:05:00,330
good idea for me this is a good idea for

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,460
everyone this is gonna be the future

00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:05,610
this is it needs a name this is gonna be

00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,470
distributed markdown apps and it's gonna

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,270
take over the world this is gonna be

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,890
like the way that people build

00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,090
applications in the future I can see it

00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,200
just all over the planet people are

00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,730
gonna be building these things and

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,650
shipping them to everyone it's gonna be

00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:19,110
amazing it's gonna revolutionize the way

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,400
software is built I know what you're

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,500
thinking you're thinking like whoa whoa

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,700
dude do you you've gone like way off the

00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,890
rails here like what what are you even

00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,690
talking about like all of these

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,100
technologies are being used for like the

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:31,410
opposite of what they were designed for

00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,300
like markdown is for a static content

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,430
not dynamic content and not user

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,170
interfaces like instant paper the whole

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,820
point is that it's the readers style not

00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,130
the authors style and now you're using

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,110
it to style an application and like bash

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:45,200
is for small scripts it's not for

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,580
building entire applications like

00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,500
there's no chance that this is gonna

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,500
become the thing that takes over the

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,860
world and I'm like really that could

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,500
never happen like that's that's

00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:00,390
impossible that would no I don't know I

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,620
don't know I I think there's reason to

00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:04,140
believe that could happen I could

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,670
actually take over the world okay okay

00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,780
now I know what you're thinking I know

00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:09,660
what you're thinking you're thinking

00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:11,010
like okay yeah yeah fine but let's be

00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,930
real nobody's gonna want to maintain

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:16,230
like a hundred thousand line of code

00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:18,330
bash like no that's just that's just a

00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,650
disaster like nobody's gonna sit through

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,750
that in real life it's okay it's okay

00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:27,020
I thought of the solution yeah thanks

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,020
very much

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,199
