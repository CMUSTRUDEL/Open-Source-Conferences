The future is now. Or then. Or it will be soon be now, but now is then.

JavaScript and its ecosystem is ever evolving and JS fatigue can be real. It’s a lot to keep up with. Staying up to date on the ever moving system feels like a fool’s errand and to some degree it can be.

But in this talk we’re going to chat about a few things:

– what’s new and important now with ES2018, ES2019 and beyond
– what’s new and important in the JavaScript ecosystem and tooling
– how to sanely integrate new features, tools, and such into your existing codebase today.
– how to get the most of using VSCode with futurist code

Come chat about the future and how to touch it today.
