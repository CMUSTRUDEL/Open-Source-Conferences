Remember loving to read comics on a Sunday afternoon when you were a kid? Maybe you don’t. In the past, traditional print comics have made it impossible for blind and visually-impaired readers to experience their heroes’ adventures first-hand. Today an increasing number of initiatives like comic book stores for the blind aim to overcome this challenge.

What if I told you that the web platform empowers us to even create comics for literally everyone?

Alongside a demo application, you see how accessibility best practices enable you to craft an immersive webcomic experience that is not only engaging for the sighted but accessible for everyone.

[Music]

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,890
yeah hi and welcome to my talk

00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:24,260
crafting comic so literally everyone in

00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,720
the next half an hour I want to talk

00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,180
with you about how we can create cool

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,650
immersive experience on the web that are

00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:33,170
literally accessible for everyone and we

00:00:30,650 --> 00:00:34,790
look at into JavaScript applications

00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,949
singer pitch applications which kind of

00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:38,809
like constraints we actually have if you

00:00:36,949 --> 00:00:40,340
want to make these applications

00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:42,620
accessible as part of our art

00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,960
experiences and also what kind of tools

00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,329
and API is we can use nowadays to

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,910
actually make this a good experience as

00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,980
we actually move on my name is Jessica

00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,960
Jordan you can find me on twitter as JJ

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,059
or underscore death and I'm also senior

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,559
front engineer at simple apps via

00:00:56,059 --> 00:00:59,420
consultancy that specializes in

00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:00,710
JavaScript Ruby rates and Phoenix Alexia

00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,870
if you would like to learn more about

00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:04,759
what you have to feel free to talk to me

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,960
after this talk but let's actually get

00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:10,009
into the topic the topic of comics is

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,800
actually really close to my heart

00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:14,600
because as maybe many of you in the

00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,700
audience as well like since I was a

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,280
little kid I was like super in love with

00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,080
comics I really like to follow the

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,290
stories of my favorite heroes and

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:26,420
favorite villains as well in these comic

00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,770
book stories and back then it was

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,420
actually like this very straightforward

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,909
approach maybe you also remember you

00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:33,290
just went to your corner store or your

00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:34,760
book store and you would actually get

00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,470
like one of these magazines and

00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:39,290
sometimes even share them with your

00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:41,750
friends and back then when print comics

00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,450
were just like the thing that you had to

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,909
use when you wanted to read like comics

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,650
stories and there were actually a couple

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:51,350
of constraints that came into your mind

00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:54,080
like as a ten-year-old when you actually

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:55,640
wanted to follow up and some of them

00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,400
included that you actually had to face

00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,990
the SS so you would have to kind of like

00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,689
buy a book somewhere maybe several books

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,009
carry them around and yeah I don't know

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,259
like as a ten year old it's like usually

00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:08,299
fine to do this right but it wasn't

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,700
actually that this accessible in this

00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:12,709
regard then also the portability

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,480
concerns is like something that comes

00:02:12,709 --> 00:02:16,340
into mind like with actually carrying

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,739
around the books but last but not least

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,660
like something that when I was younger

00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:23,630
never really thought about but that

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:25,490
actually is a very big barrier when you

00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,730
look at like traditional

00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:30,260
insert comic books is the fact that you

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,690
as a ten-year-old you actually have to

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,040
be cited to read them and I think back

00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,380
then I never thought about it but

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:39,050
thinking about the topic more and about

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,730
Dyke comics that I actually wanted to

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:43,370
create I thought about it a little bit

00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,470
more in depth and was like so amazed by

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:48,080
this idea that up until this point I

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:51,110
never thought about like all the kids

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,450
that couldn't actually read the books

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,000
themselves because of a blind or maybe

00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,800
had low vision and only could experience

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,140
all of these stories about that the

00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,450
favorite heroes by narratives of their

00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,830
sighted friends maybe when they were

00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:05,510
lucky there would be a movie adaptation

00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,690
like ten years later and they could

00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,190
actually listen to this one or maybe not

00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:14,060
an audio book adaptation that came out

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:16,100
later but as with traditional comic book

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,680
format it was never really possible for

00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:21,260
a blanket for example to actually read

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,290
these stories and I looked into it a

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,180
little bit more I was like this seems

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:28,130
actually pretty obvious once you think

00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,050
about this so probably someone already

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,790
out there also thought about it and try

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,320
to overcome this hurdle and in fact

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,300
there were already a lot of different

00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,920
people who try to make comic books

00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,930
accessible for literally everyone

00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,090
there's for example this really cool art

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,520
project by Flip Maya which is called

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,860
life and this is a very interesting

00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:48,440
haptic experience for both sighted and

00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,620
blind users they can actually read each

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,450
panel by using the hands and this kind

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,610
of punch of texture that is applied to

00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,770
the paper makes it possible to figure

00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,410
out the images and the figures that are

00:03:57,770 --> 00:04:03,530
depicted in each panel by just using

00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:05,390
your pants by your haptic senses on the

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,010
other hand comics of power is also a

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:09,620
great initiative I want to mention at

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:12,260
this point it's a comic book store for

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,770
the blind and it allows readers to

00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,489
actually immerse himself in the comic

00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:22,220
book worlds of their favorite heroes by

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:24,740
using the audio format and in contrast

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,900
to the traditional audio book this one

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,150
actually tries to emphasize the comic

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,590
book experience from the first page when

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,930
you actually open the book it even

00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:34,460
describe to you how closely the cover is

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,560
when you actually hold it into your hand

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,020
sense how it actually feels like to see

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,340
this first page for yourself and

00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,560
all of the comics that are published by

00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,720
comics and power are also narrated by a

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,879
single voice actor making it a little

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,979
more personal experience making you feel

00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,629
like it is kind of like inner voice

00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:52,789
actually talking back to you while you

00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,259
read the comic as if you were a sighted

00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:55,430
reader and I think this is really

00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:56,949
amazing you should definitely check it

00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,240
out if you want to know more about it

00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:02,000
and last but not least I also want to

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:05,240
highlight another example of accessible

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,490
web comics this is like interesting

00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,560
comic series by Crystal be right called

00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,240
it is arathi and he actually makes a

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,099
point that each time when he actually

00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,330
uploads an image for a comic strip that

00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:16,580
is new on this website

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,310
to also upload a transcript that

00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:22,039
actually describes each single scenario

00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:24,259
in every panel and also what the

00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,060
characters are actually talking about so

00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:27,770
this makes an image format that is

00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,659
usually not accessible directly

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,940
accessible by providing the related

00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:34,180
transcript so screen reader users can

00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,349
actually make sense of it as well and

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:39,319
all of these examples are pretty great

00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:41,319
and I was thinking to myself well if I

00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,030
wanted to make like a commit myself like

00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:45,500
they're already like a really cool ideas

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:47,479
how I could actually get started and

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,030
also realized by looking at these

00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:53,060
examples there's this one format like

00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:55,490
this one dimension of our census that we

00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,469
can really make much more use of when we

00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,240
actually want to make comic book

00:05:57,469 --> 00:06:01,940
experience more accessible and this is

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,190
like the audio spectrum of our

00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:06,529
experience of the world and by using the

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,419
audio format I actually have also on the

00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:10,310
web a very good leverage to make use of

00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,770
it as we will see later and this is

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:15,680
something I also wanted to take a

00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,060
further look into him also just like

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,259
thinking about where I want to get

00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,969
started I was thinking it would be

00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:22,190
really cool if I actually had like a

00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:24,919
cool web app that I could create to

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,029
publish my own comic book and I was

00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:27,259
thinking would be really cool to have

00:06:26,029 --> 00:06:29,240
like a singer page Travis good

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:31,580
application because I feel it would be

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:34,219
really nice to have a very snippy user

00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:36,770
interface for sighted users and that it

00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:37,969
feels like very fluid I was thinking it

00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,219
would be nice to build it with ember

00:06:37,969 --> 00:06:42,349
chess not only because I already have

00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:43,940
like a full tool set to get started with

00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:45,800
my application including routing a data

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,360
solution a state management solution but

00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,360
also this is something that I already

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,070
have a lot of experiments with and I

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,910
also wanted to have a way using a

00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:56,000
JavaScript application

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,980
you have animations and interactivity

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,110
tied to each other and make this more

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,630
immersive and interesting experience for

00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:05,330
sighted users looking at accessibility

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,070
though I realized well like they might

00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,200
actually but is some couple kind of

00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:11,300
constraints which we look into in just a

00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,300
bit and some of them for example

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,840
included the idea that how do I actually

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,430
narrate the story to blind users for

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,460
example how do I actually make the story

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,190
that is usually only captured in images

00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,540
accessible to those and I was thinking

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:28,220
would be really cool if I also had a

00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:30,590
transcript similar to the esperar

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:33,740
example we saw early on but it should be

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:36,290
embedded into my story and by navigating

00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,030
from panel to panel like screen reader

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,580
user for example could still follow the

00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:43,130
story but a sighted user would still get

00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,230
the very same experience as a blind user

00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,870
and therefore I didn't would have to

00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:50,390
duplicate like all of the content and by

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:53,240
actually making use of screen readers to

00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:56,600
actually let the screen reader actually

00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:59,270
do the work for assistive technology

00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:03,260
users while reading the comic also can

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:05,270
kind of recreate this idea that an inner

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,920
voice actually reading back to the

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,990
reader as they're going through the page

00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:11,450
and this sounds really interesting to me

00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:13,850
so I was thinking okay so now I have

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:16,190
this image and actually this image is

00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:18,230
not visible now so to speak

00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,720
metaphorically to the screen reader user

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,400
instead like they don't actually get

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,250
anything out of the page if I just like

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,930
uploading image and of course if I'd use

00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:29,840
like image text I can use the alt

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:31,700
attribute to append any contract

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,039
transcript that is related to this image

00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:36,140
and also using the area label I have

00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:38,390
another way to if I'm for example not

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:40,849
able to use an image tag to declare

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:43,490
anything that might be relevant for

00:08:40,849 --> 00:08:47,030
screen reader user in the scope of this

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:49,130
certain image and using semantic HTML I

00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:51,290
also realize there's a lot of cool ways

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:53,090
that I can actually embed text for

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:56,600
example speech this is my characters in

00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:58,040
my comic stories without having to do

00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,720
like extra work I can just see the

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,130
semantic HTML that works on a box we

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:05,210
will see later on how this actually

00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,499
plays out in my case for example I use a

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,749
layered approach

00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:11,269
my comic panels so each single panel may

00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:14,269
consist of several layers of imagery

00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:16,369
that can be animated independent of each

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,139
other and thinking about this I thought

00:09:16,369 --> 00:09:20,539
it would actually really nice to still

00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:22,609
keep all of these imageries together in

00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:25,039
one single element and one single

00:09:22,609 --> 00:09:27,109
component for example but still have a

00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:31,969
way to narrate what is happening this

00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:34,309
singular unit of content and using for

00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:35,899
example an article track and then also

00:09:34,309 --> 00:09:37,909
appending a background image I don't

00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:41,209
have the ability just without attribute

00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:43,969
but using the roll tag for declaring

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:45,979
images and also the area label I again

00:09:43,969 --> 00:09:48,469
have the ability to directly say well

00:09:45,979 --> 00:09:50,149
this stack of images that you have right

00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:52,189
now here and this single component

00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,439
should be narrated with the text for

00:09:52,189 --> 00:09:57,109
example a person currently struggles to

00:09:54,439 --> 00:09:59,509
sail in a boat and this way I can

00:09:57,109 --> 00:10:01,309
actually make use of a lot of like cool

00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:03,859
techniques for sighted users to have

00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:05,689
interesting animations in a single panel

00:10:03,859 --> 00:10:08,359
but still have the possibility to make

00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:12,499
it accessible for users who might visit

00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:14,689
my web site with a screen reader of

00:10:12,499 --> 00:10:16,879
course if you ask the possibility to use

00:10:14,689 --> 00:10:18,439
an image tag feel free to do so this is

00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,179
something that HTML just gives the out

00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:21,679
of box without having to do any extra

00:10:20,179 --> 00:10:27,259
work and this is something to keep in

00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:29,929
mind also thinking about semantic hTML I

00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:33,229
realized if I actually try to make the

00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:35,179
HTML play in my favor I also don't have

00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:37,819
to do any extra work either by for

00:10:35,179 --> 00:10:40,489
example using ptex paragraph tags for

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:43,129
any kind of speech that my character use

00:10:40,489 --> 00:10:45,769
I can also make sure that this is read

00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:47,989
by screen readers as it should and also

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:49,459
spooning a user can already estimate how

00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:51,679
they should actually navigate the page

00:10:49,459 --> 00:10:53,720
and what they should actually make out

00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:55,939
of this certain content but making sure

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,949
that I not only put a div on everything

00:10:55,939 --> 00:10:59,809
this is something that I get just like

00:10:57,949 --> 00:11:04,009
for free out of the box by using

00:10:59,809 --> 00:11:06,769
semantic hTML and let's actually have a

00:11:04,009 --> 00:11:08,179
look how this plays out right so later

00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:10,309
on I will also talk a little bit about

00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:12,859
yeah why I think it's actually important

00:11:10,309 --> 00:11:13,249
to use screen readers on what you're

00:11:12,859 --> 00:11:16,129
building

00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:18,680
I just want to briefly highlight how

00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:19,939
this would actually sound like

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,779
and let's actually have a look at this

00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:25,670
so I'm for example like on a Mac and

00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:29,829
therefore I can already make use of this

00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:32,240
free screen reader tool called voiceover

00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:38,179
some of you might have already used it

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:41,449
for testing and accessibility window

00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:43,399
accessibility features selected has

00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:45,709
keyboard focus tells you a lot of things

00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:47,209
first space with grave containing window

00:11:45,709 --> 00:11:49,579
crafting comics for literally everyone

00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:51,589
talk slides by Jessica Jordan rave full

00:11:49,579 --> 00:11:54,470
screen space brick I click here to enter

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,879
main navigation die manias link there is

00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:57,410
a person in a thick jacket sitting on a

00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:59,689
boat on the dark and stormy sea group

00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,459
main and as you can see as I navigate to

00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:03,050
the first panel we can already read the

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:06,679
text we could for example also say

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:08,029
navigation couches articles just like

00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:09,860
navigate through all the articles

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:11,509
because each panel section article and

00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,339
then you get like a better idea how this

00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:15,679
actual play out for a screen reader user

00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,149
and see for example now on the first

00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,529
panel you can now navigate there is a

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:20,809
cursor on a thick jacket sitting on a

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:23,499
boat on the dark and stormy sea the boat

00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:27,410
is rocking wild waves splash against it

00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:30,319
simulation splash you can also click

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,420
like through the several so per year so

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:34,879
like the kind of like word sounds for

00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,519
different things in your actual panel

00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,800
once you declared like a semantic HTML

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,999
the waves continue shaking about the

00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,800
person on the boat sitting in it

00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,220
motionless the waves move further and

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,480
further the person on the boat is

00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,040
turning over the left shoulder

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:50,300
their face still and recognizing the

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,850
dark and half covered with the hood of

00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,379
their jacket which way and also speech

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:56,209
bubbles actually become accessible by

00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:57,559
default once they actually do this the

00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,149
person starts roaming through the see

00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,189
continuing they pass backwards through

00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:03,079
the waves by making sure that each

00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:05,240
panels actually transcribed well we can

00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:07,040
also still embed all of the cool

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,689
narrated experience into each panel and

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,759
so that's something that's a little bit

00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:12,350
more eye candy for like the sighted

00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:18,860
users as well and I think this is really

00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:22,009
nice to keep in mind voice over off and

00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:24,499
as we now saw at this example there's

00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,029
already a lot of stuff that we can do

00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:27,799
for screen readers in general but

00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:30,470
accessibility isn't only concerned about

00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:32,510
screen reader accessibility but also a

00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:35,180
lot of like other things that for

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:37,070
users with low vision or dyslexia might

00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,079
struggle with if you for example think

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:42,139
about this feature that a lot of like

00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:45,470
mobile web apps nowadays have is that

00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:48,019
they try to make it impossible to

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:50,209
actually zoom into your content and what

00:13:48,019 --> 00:13:51,589
I would like to advise you is to really

00:13:50,209 --> 00:13:53,449
not make use of this but instead

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:55,579
actually allow a user to zoom into any

00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:57,620
Content that they have and if you

00:13:55,579 --> 00:14:00,649
actually make sure that you never set

00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:03,079
like the maximum width of your content

00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,389
to a certain way like even like someone

00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:08,120
with low vision can still make use of

00:14:05,389 --> 00:14:11,209
the cool and illustrative ways that you

00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,430
try to illustrate your comic by

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:15,740
themselves without yeah having actually

00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:17,240
to use a screen reader for example and I

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,550
think it's very important to keep in

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,709
mind as well if you think about actually

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:25,130
having your web comic available for

00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:28,820
mobile devices also thinking about font

00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:30,860
sizes is I think quite standard and also

00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,899
quite easy to achieve once they actually

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:34,699
stick to a rule of thumb for example

00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,649
making sure that all the font sizes in

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:39,709
your web comic at least like 16 pixels

00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:41,779
and also the contrast is something that

00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:44,000
comes into mind and can also be rather

00:14:41,779 --> 00:14:46,550
easily catched by a lot of accessibility

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,470
tools that actually keep you in check in

00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:52,399
regards to the contrast that you find in

00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:56,149
your application but let's also think

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:59,449
outside of just contrast select font

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:02,800
sizes and also how screenreader users

00:14:59,449 --> 00:15:04,760
actually access this in other paths what

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,949
kind of measures we actually have to

00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,410
take to make our web comic experience

00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:10,970
really accessible and in this regard I

00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,149
actually want to tell you a short story

00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,560
a story that really made me think about

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,120
what I as a developer actually have to

00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,260
take care of once I create my own web

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,360
comic and this story actually is slated

00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,490
to be named as the Pokemon shock

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,170
incident maybe can I get get like a

00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,819
quick show of hands Mike who maybe

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,680
already has an idea here and like get

00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:33,319
your hands up what this actually refers

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,010
to okay that's like once lonely hand

00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,470
over there

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,430
so okay everyone is in for a little bit

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:42,380
of suspense so this story actually dates

00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,149
back quite a while ago and maybe some of

00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,510
you have therefore also kind of like

00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:47,940
forgotten about it but

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:53,340
has been a really big deal back then and

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:56,670
December 16 1997 there was quite a

00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:58,710
mysterious thing going on actually a lot

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,470
of children suddenly back in this very

00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:03,920
evening a night of December the 16th

00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:06,210
we're admitted to hospitals in Japan and

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,950
in the beginning of us not really clear

00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:10,740
what was going on a lot of the children

00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:12,900
actually suffered from yeah kind of like

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,250
dizziness nausea headaches sometimes

00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,360
they even lost their consciousness and

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:20,370
had seizures and the hospital staff and

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,020
also the people that actually admitted

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,550
the children hospital we were wondering

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:26,280
what this actually was about and all

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:27,990
kind of like boiled down to one singular

00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,940
incident that combined all of the

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,580
children experience which was they were

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,850
actually watching a TV children's show

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,370
just at this very evening before they

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,840
got admitted to the hospital so

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:41,670
obviously everyone was like a little

00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,440
panic and the TV stations were actually

00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,030
broadcasted this that I can Japan back

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,440
then they took the show down and

00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,480
actually did some investigation they

00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,860
were like okay well how can this

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,540
actually be like there must be a

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,340
connection but what actually happened

00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,340
when the children watch this particular

00:16:53,340 --> 00:17:00,090
TV show and they actually found that

00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:03,270
they aired this 38 episode of the first

00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:05,220
season of Pokemon like children TV show

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:07,440
if you don't know it about like people

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,449
catching monsters and trying to let them

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,760
fight against each other and they found

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:14,910
while investigating the footage of this

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,730
particular series one scene that comes

00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:19,650
in maybe like 20 minutes into the

00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:22,740
episode of course I'm not going to show

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,820
the footage it's not safe but I just

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,190
give you an estimation I would actually

00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:28,020
look like so in this particular scene

00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:30,690
and they are sacrified going on it

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,640
should be look super dramatic and they

00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:35,040
decided like the creators of the episode

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,140
to show kids like this one particular

00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,630
frame like with a bright red color in

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,870
the background interchangeably with

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:45,000
another screen with a very bright blue

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:47,190
background and on top of this they

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,900
showed it like in a very high frequency

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,330
they showed that very fast

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,930
interchangeably like with a very low

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,150
kind of like very high hearts rate and

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,750
for about six seconds a lot of like

00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:59,190
children

00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:01,470
already experienced the symptoms

00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,630
of nausea headaches sometimes seizures

00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:06,030
and loss of consciousness and what you

00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:08,220
can see from this is that the creation

00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:12,170
of the strobe light effect this flashy

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:14,580
light effect actually had a very serious

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,080
implication for a lot of children that

00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,150
sometimes were not even aware that they

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,580
either suffered from photosensitive

00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,130
epilepsy or that they are at least

00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,370
successful to these kind of strobe light

00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:29,300
effects and looking at the story there's

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:32,700
something that comes to our mind quiet

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,260
yeah quite promptly that if we think

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,810
about accessibility we also have to

00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,020
think about safety and sometimes the

00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:42,540
users that actually consume our web apps

00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,970
or our art experiences might not even be

00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:46,140
aware until they are in the situation

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,870
that they suffer from the consequences

00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,450
that they're actually sensitive to it so

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:53,250
my advice is general to just like avoid

00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,200
any kind of strobe light effects because

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,520
you can never be sure that you use us

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,560
actually we're and even a Content

00:18:56,520 --> 00:19:01,970
warning will not save them from that if

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,830
they just realize in this very moment

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,930
apart from safety also a lot of other

00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,400
things come into mind when we build web

00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,410
applications that should be accessible

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,870
keyboard accessibility color contrast we

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:15,450
also had a look at a symmetric HTML a

00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:17,610
great way to make it accessible for

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,110
everyone but also if you want to help

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:22,460
screenreader users to actually navigate

00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:25,470
our pages correct heading high regime

00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:27,600
landmarks and also page navigation come

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:30,060
into play and page navigation I think is

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,260
something we might never really think

00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:37,290
about when we build 90s style kind of

00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,550
server-side render pages but once we

00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:40,230
actually get in the area of building

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,180
single page applications it becomes also

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:43,800
really important because at the end of

00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:45,630
the day we actually rely on the

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:47,550
framework or the libraries that we're

00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:49,050
using to actually provide a lot of

00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:51,600
functionality for us to emulate

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:54,420
experiences from server-side render

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,140
pages that might not be available

00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,120
anymore in the single side page

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,180
JavaScript client-side world and things

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,290
for example when we changed a route and

00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,490
change a page in a single page

00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:10,500
application like URL updates very

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,030
informative for a sighted user but for

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,630
someone who uses a screen reader it

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,910
might not be

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:18,240
so apparent that a page navigation

00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:19,920
actually has occurred and in many

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,870
different frameworks that you might work

00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,340
in there already students with it I want

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,710
to highlight one solution that is

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,630
available in the Emma community and

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,060
wants you to talk about how you can

00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:32,550
apply something similar as well like in

00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:34,590
any kind of other JavaScript stack in

00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,930
ember for example we have one atom

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,060
that's called MSCI document title that

00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:41,400
helps you to update the meta title of

00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:42,960
your page so the kind of title that you

00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,660
also will later on see in the tab of

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,750
your page and this in itself is not so

00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:52,230
yea useful for a screen your users

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:55,140
obviously but what it helps is with

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:57,150
actually tracking what kind of title is

00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,560
actually on when like a user and a

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,090
certain route and helps you to kind of

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,040
like manage this as you create certain

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,740
routes or sub pages of your application

00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:07,410
and using this one in addition with the

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:10,140
plug-in accessibility announcer we

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:12,150
actually now have a way to for example

00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,100
insert a component the route announcer

00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,800
component is provided by the plugin into

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,410
our application template which will make

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,870
sure that anytime a page navigation

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:25,560
actually occurred in our application an

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,750
area life attribute on an element that

00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:30,540
is rendered at all times in our

00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,280
application is updated with the title of

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:33,930
the page and therefore this is always

00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,180
announced to every screen reader like

00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:38,160
area life tags can be used in this way

00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,960
to actually announce these kind of

00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,810
dynamic changes to screen reader users

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,240
to make sure that even a blind reader

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:47,100
might be possible to realize oh I

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,100
actually got back to the home page now

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:54,420
so maybe let's get up better get back to

00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:56,400
reading the comic and last but not least

00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:58,740
also want to take a few moments to think

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,650
about accessibility on a more high level

00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:03,090
and why yeah why are you actually all

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:06,000
here and to actually listen to this talk

00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:08,700
because you might think like well we

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,920
already do so many strides and actually

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,020
bring accessibility to the web so why

00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,570
why is this like such a big focus in

00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:18,150
this talk and here I want to focus on

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:20,250
some of yeah maybe the one biggest

00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:22,170
takeaway I actually had from a talk that

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,670
a recent saw by Maile Sumner who ii

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:26,410
excessively advocate and also

00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,310
senior software engineer at LinkedIn who

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:32,500
talked about us trying to not break the

00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:34,870
web and there for example the

00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:37,930
highlighted the several results or the

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:40,210
investigation results of the vessel

00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,640
ability in mind organization which

00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:46,350
actually made an effort to look at the 1

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:50,650
million most popular home pages so

00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:53,050
facebook.com google.com Instagram calm I

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,670
don't know think about all the other 1

00:22:53,050 --> 00:22:56,110
million most popular pages that are

00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:59,560
probably out there right now on the web

00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,420
and try to find out how many of the home

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,670
pages so the very first page that he's

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:06,220
actually enters I actually accessible

00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:10,300
how many of them actually are bug free

00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,680
and regards to accessibility and the

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:15,010
results were actually quite striking

00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:18,810
because what they found is that of the 1

00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:21,760
million pages investigated 2.2 percent

00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:24,400
actually didn't have any accessibility

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,400
errors regarding to the back content

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,070
accessibility guidelines which give you

00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,870
an idea about color contrasts and font

00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:34,720
sizes and what you should actually do in

00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:37,540
your page to make it accessible and the

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,000
astounding rest of almost 98% of

00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:46,330
websites was in regards to accessibility

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,130
broke and this is something that at

00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,160
least for me as a sighted developer is

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:52,720
kind of surprising I kind of go like

00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,630
well like these pages don't seem that

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,640
broken to me but once I actually try to

00:23:55,630 --> 00:24:00,370
navigate the web with a screen reader

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,890
alone with my screen unplugged I realize

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:06,940
yeah maybe there are suck another story

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:08,470
to it and in this context I would like

00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:10,780
to encourage you to make use of

00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:13,780
automated tools that actually help you

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:15,460
to find out if the pages that you build

00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:17,140
and the applications your bird are still

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,840
on top of everything and gots

00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,970
accessibility and XCore for example is a

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,130
great library that you can install into

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,050
your application or maybe you also have

00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:27,540
an add-on similar in your open-source

00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,060
community that provides you with this

00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:34,390
that helps you to actually audit any

00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:36,430
kind of accessibility concerns in your

00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:38,410
application easily and also keeps track

00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:38,890
of regressions as you keep on building

00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,740
this

00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,820
application and also would like to

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,340
encourage you to practice empathy

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:50,290
because I think this is actually most

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:52,960
important point why we nowadays still

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:54,670
struggle with accessibility concerns

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,890
it's not so much that the tools are not

00:24:54,670 --> 00:24:59,650
there or it's not so much that we don't

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:01,990
know how it works it's more like we at

00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:04,750
some point need to realize it really is

00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:05,500
a priority even if the legislation is

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,160
not there yet

00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:11,140
even if our users don't write us 1000 ml

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,900
every day to say well something is broke

00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:16,150
because yeah a lot of people out saying

00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:17,530
we cannot use the web right now and I

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:20,860
think we had a place right now where we

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:23,020
can change so much about it in this

00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,670
context to actually gain an

00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:26,860
understanding I would encourage you to

00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:28,900
actually do manual accessibility testing

00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:30,970
and even if it's just for having the

00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,230
experience for yourself actually go to a

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,060
website or something that you built

00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:36,040
yourself and get a screen reader like a

00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,920
Mac you can just see voiceover as a song

00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,780
as I show the demo but nvd egg from

00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,610
rocks are also like free solution to

00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,670
just use out of the box for example for

00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,920
Windows and once you actually have the

00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,840
screen in already unplug your screen and

00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,730
actually try to go to your frame

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,370
websites and try to use something try to

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:57,490
navigate try to actually do the things

00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,800
that you do on the daily and maybe have

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,780
an experience where you go like huh like

00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:03,370
this is surprising I wouldn't I wouldn't

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,970
have thought it's actually not that

00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:09,100
straightforward and I believe with this

00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:11,230
understanding we really have a chance to

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,930
learn more about what we need to do in

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,580
regards to accessibility but last but

00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:16,960
not least I also want to highlight if

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,060
you want to learn more about mineral and

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,400
accessibility testing a blog post that I

00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:25,600
rolled like a quick intro into how for

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:27,880
example you slice over and also last but

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,700
not least I want to highlight that you

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,320
can do so many cool things the web

00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,630
regards to art experiences webcomic

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,370
experiences but most importantly if

00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,300
there's anything that you could take

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:42,070
away from this talk is that it's we

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:44,860
actually make a commitment to

00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:47,140
accessibility we can but not only really

00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,420
cool art experiences and really cool

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:52,050
comics for literally everyone we can

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,700
literally build anything on the web

00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,250
for everyone and we have the means and

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,260
the chance to do this today with a set

00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,460
thank you very much and have a great

00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,650
time at directive course

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:06,469
[Applause]
