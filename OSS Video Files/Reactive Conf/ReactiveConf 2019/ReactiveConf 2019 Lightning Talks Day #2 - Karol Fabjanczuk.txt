00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:20,390
[Music]

00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:22,580
thank you for the introduction and thank

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,349
you for the Easter days sciencing tour

00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,130
tours it was awesome

00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:29,990
thank you and I would like to add that

00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:33,230
the Constitution composition API is

00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:36,820
meant for medium-sized and larger

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:40,790
components and like with react hooves

00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:44,030
it's completely additive so you can just

00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,820
use other ways of defining components if

00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:50,809
you like that's all let's start

00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:54,410
when new technology is announced I

00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:57,590
always ask myself few questions why was

00:00:54,410 --> 00:01:00,320
it introduced and how can i benefit from

00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:07,009
it I will try to answer that questions

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:10,250
in the talk and show how to use it for

00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:14,509
me the main benefit of using components

00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:17,810
API composition api is called

00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:21,080
organization let's compare it to in a

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:25,610
way how you organize files inside your

00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:28,189
application you can organize files by

00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:34,729
type where logic is spread across

00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:37,610
different folders and by logic where for

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:40,549
example about page is contained inside

00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:43,970
one folder with all necessary parts

00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:46,729
there let me ask the question which one

00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:49,700
do you use so a please raise a hand if

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:52,369
you use an organ say if you organize

00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:56,000
files by type like on the left side of

00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:59,299
the screen okay thank you

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,090
and do you organize files by logic so

00:01:59,299 --> 00:02:03,920
the right side of the screen

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:07,850
great I can see that most of you is

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,140
using second one this is the same with

00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:15,560
called organization in view components

00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:20,079
as you can see here in current options

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:25,220
API logic is spread across logic is

00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:28,190
shout here by colored boxes logic is

00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,210
spread across component and mixed

00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:32,120
together so

00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:35,360
if you want to work on something like

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,720
for example sorting you have to

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,890
constantly jump through the file in

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,820
search of necessary parts on the other

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:49,400
hand composition API allows us to group

00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:56,270
things together and this is just easier

00:02:49,400 --> 00:03:00,770
easier easier and the next is logic

00:02:56,270 --> 00:03:03,710
wheels if you want to share some logic

00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:06,020
and this logic is you can't easily

00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,870
extract that logic into separate

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:14,090
component you can use mixings or

00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:18,850
higher-order components and these have

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:22,630
some problems mainly with mixings were

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:27,350
refactoring becomes really painful

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:32,360
composition api solves most of its probe

00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:35,930
these problems but how we do it how it's

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,200
possible so we carefully extract all

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:41,750
view core views core capabilities into

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,980
standalone functions these functions can

00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:51,500
be easily imported and then used inside

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:54,560
new setup option in which you return

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:57,320
something if you return something these

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,680
things are accessible inside components

00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:03,320
template and this API is our standalone

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,930
functions not connected with component

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:09,590
so you can easily group them how you

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:12,590
like it move them outside component

00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:17,960
definition or even extract them into

00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:22,670
other file if you want to see a real

00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:25,880
work example of view composition API you

00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:29,480
can check this repository and I would

00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:32,870
like to add one more word I really like

00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:37,630
composition API it's similar to react

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:42,160
hooks but without the traps of for new

00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:46,550
users because for example it does not

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:50,990
revolve ate on every component rerender

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:57,790
it's a evaluate only once so I encourage

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:57,790
you to try it and thank you very much

00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,650
thank you so much that was Carol Fabian

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,400
Chuck we have one question for you at

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:09,530
least so let's see that question is

00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,360
there a situation in which you would

00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:15,020
choose options API instead of

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,520
composition API if so why and when of

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:23,210
course as I said composition IP is meant

00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:26,810
mostly for bigger components if these

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:30,800
components are smaller just use the

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:34,930
options API you don't need to adjust to

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,130
a new way of of defining components

00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,840
that's all the questions we have for

00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,110
right now thank you so much again this

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,279
is Carol Fabian Chuck

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,279
