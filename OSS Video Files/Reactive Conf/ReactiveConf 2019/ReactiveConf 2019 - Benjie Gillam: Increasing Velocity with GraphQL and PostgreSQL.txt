GraphQL has exploded in popularity since its public launch in 2015, and PostgreSQL is still going strong after 20 years of development, gaining market share and impressive features at an ever-increasing rate. These tools can pair beautifully, in particular, because they’re both strongly typed and declarative. In this talk, we’ll learn how combining these two technologies can lead to massively increased software development and delivery speed, faster APIs, fewer bugs, and ultimately enable you to focus on delivering value on the frontend rather than maintaining three different layers of data models and associated logic on the backend (DB, application, API).
