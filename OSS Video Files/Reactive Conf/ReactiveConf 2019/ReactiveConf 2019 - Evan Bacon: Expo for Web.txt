Progressive web apps can be difficult to support, hard to test, and _unfortunate_ to maintain. With Expo for web you can maximize code sharing between your native and web apps. The robust set of Unimodules provides you with unified APIs for things like camera, gestures, image picker, persistent storage, and more. Optimized for performance, Expo’s Babel preset enables you to do advanced tree-shaking which removes all unused platform code. New universal testing libraries make it easy to ensure your app is running as expected on all platforms. Expo web also provides a set of Webpack plugins for adding offline support and automatic generation of PWA assets. I’ll be discussing this, and possibly some future plans for supporting things like universal navigation, SSR, and connected applications with things like apple site association.

[Music]

00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:20,150
what's up guys I'm Evan today I'm gonna

00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,429
be talking to you about building

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,740
universal applications I'm really

00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,960
excited to talk about this when I say

00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,730
universal application what I mean is an

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,919
application that you write once and then

00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,930
you can run anywhere and today we're

00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:38,070
mostly gonna be focusing on mobile apps

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,620
and websites so this presentation just

00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,390
like any great project starts with the

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,960
question of do you build an app or a

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,430
website

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,520
and the reason you need to choose is

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,809
because the stack is totally different

00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,180
for apps you can use a cross-platform

00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,640
tool like react native or xamarin or

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,039
flutter and to build a website there is

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,480
a bunch of options like react angular

00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,949
View wordpress of course but what if you

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,449
could build both like what if you had

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:05,519
the bandwidth what if you could afford

00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,410
to like a lot of big companies and

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,140
Facebook Twitter Instagram YouTube

00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,869
I can name a lot of companies what would

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,270
that look like and the answer is

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:17,790
basically an identical product so this

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,750
is Twitter you we have the web version

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,750
and the native app version and they look

00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:27,600
almost identical across like everything

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,560
and there's a lot of great like reasons

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,229
for this like you don't want to lock

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,399
your user into the platform you just

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,049
kind of want to lock them into your

00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:37,140
service so having it look the same

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,970
everywhere is really great so going back

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,070
to that list of solutions I showed you

00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,350
guys earlier I'm going to discuss how

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,009
one of them can be used to create truly

00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:50,130
Universal apps today and that is react

00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:52,170
native so let's talk about reacting

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,180
that's like a phrase I say almost every

00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,560
day now let's talk about react it's got

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,299
a lot of great features it has an

00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,110
amazing community it's got great

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:02,159
examples

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,930
it's got hooks so wouldn't you make a

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,229
website with react you use something

00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:10,229
called react Dom and react Dom uses an

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:12,480
XML style system called JSX which render

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,300
HTML and it promises will get more

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,360
complicated here in a second so it looks

00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,670
like HTML but it's not

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,410
and then react native came along and it

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:24,180
provided all of those great react

00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,600
features but now you could use them to

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,730
make iOS apps and instead of going for

00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,670
platforms specific names like react Dom

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,160
it used these platform agnostic names

00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:38,070
like view and image and text and because

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,810
of that a guy Christoph Madeira who was

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,270
working at Facebook created react

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,610
Android which didn't need to change any

00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,390
of the API it just used that same view

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:50,160
image and text these primitives so what

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,620
is a primitive well say you want to

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,770
render text to a screen write any text

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,020
any screen and the browser you would use

00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,420
something like a span or PE or an h1 or

00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,850
any kind of element and then on iOS you

00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:05,190
would use a UI label and on Android you

00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:08,430
would use a text view from the Android

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,070
SDK but a primitive would be something

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,900
like text where you write it once and

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,940
then based off where you've run it it

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,670
binds to the correct native element so

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,260
it seems difficult but I mean it is a

00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:23,760
little difficult and this is something

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,340
that Nicholas Gallagher worked on

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,230
solving when he was at Twitter and made

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,220
that react native for web and the reason

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,989
I give this really a long-winded

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,930
explanation is because the name react

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:35,610
needed for web is pretty bad it kind of

00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,150
insinuate city took react which is

00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,920
awesome

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:39,780
it made it work natively which is

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,420
awesome and they made that work back on

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,130
the web which is like kind of redundant

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:45,180
but it's not where it does it all what

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,330
it really does is it takes that

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:53,760
primitive style of using view image and

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:55,380
text and it applies that to web and it's

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,989
really cool a lot of people are really

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,480
into us all of these dope companies here

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,269
like Major League Soccer and the times

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,400
they all use ranter for their pwace

00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:09,120
desktop pwace supplementary web sites

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,980
personal projects lots of things and

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,080
Twitter which at the time of giving this

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,600
presentation which is like the sixth

00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,229
biggest website is written in react

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,630
native web it's the new version is so

00:04:19,229 --> 00:04:26,370
it's awesome and everyone must be using

00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:28,349
it right well not not fully right it's

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,610
used a lot less than react native this

00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:31,139
blue line up here and capsule eights

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,680
Android and iOS

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,360
and then down here this is web and so my

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,620
first inclination was just that like

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,539
maybe people don't actually make

00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,280
websites maybe they just mostly make you

00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:43,740
know native apps and then I had to react

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:49,169
Dom and realized that was very wrong

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:51,090
16 times wrong to be exact so why why is

00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:52,740
this because if you used web with react

00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:54,810
native you would have like that

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,650
identical website and native app it's

00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:00,479
very performant it's a proven technology

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:04,379
so like why isn't everyone using it and

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:06,000
I kind of identified a few major issues

00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,699
with how people were approaching react

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,830
native for web and that we will explore

00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,219
them an order of most interesting to

00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:15,659
least interesting so to first understand

00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:17,250
the issues with react native or web we

00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:20,610
need to understand the issues with react

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:23,250
native and the the biggest core issue

00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,870
with react native is that if we look at

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,479
some of these apps these are all iOS

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,039
that are teen apps right here as you can

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,669
see they're very complicated there's a

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,379
lot going on on the screen and all of

00:05:32,669 --> 00:05:36,599
these apps cannot be built with the

00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:38,759
modules provided by react native that's

00:05:36,599 --> 00:05:41,370
because we're native like react Dom is a

00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:45,150
library and not a framework so it relies

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,490
heavily on community libraries to create

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,139
comprehensive apps but whereas with

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,360
react Dom you can create those community

00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:54,000
libraries with JavaScript react native

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:59,729
you need to know Objective C and Java so

00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,979
it's it's thoroughly harder so if we

00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,560
look at just three of these we were like

00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,560
Maps gestures videos navigation I read

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,750
everything off the screen everybody if

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,490
we look at just these none of these are

00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:13,440
provided and react native and they're

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,150
all pretty critical to making a lot of

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,029
different apps like navigation every

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,310
single app uses that so when people want

00:06:18,029 --> 00:06:22,409
to make production-ready applications

00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:25,259
with react native what a lot of people

00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:28,020
do is they use a framework called expo

00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,080
now I love Expo it's the best I work on

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,370
Expo and with Expo you can use it to

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,340
create production-ready

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,979
applications for iOS Android and pretty

00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:40,860
soon web I mean kind of already with web

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,139
and it's really exciting I work on the

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,000
expo for web which is this new project

00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,560
which kind of takes and solve

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,650
the same problems that Expo solve with

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,410
react native but it does that for web

00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,480
and Expo makes things easy by providing

00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:56,550
kind of three things or at least I could

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,580
fit three things in the talk so the

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:03,780
first one is the universal API arguably

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:06,630
the most fun in the second one is a it's

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,640
a bunch of services built around Expo

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:10,320
which just makes it easier it kind of

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,940
lowers the barrier for getting into

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,130
building native apps and we'll look into

00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:17,250
that in a second and then the last one

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:18,720
web pack are just kind of the config

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,940
there's a lot of dev tools built around

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,400
it because native apps are hard to

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,200
develop and as we'll see here in a

00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,230
second react native can also react

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,010
native web can also be very hard to dig

00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:34,530
into so I find the best way to

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:38,160
demonstrate the universal Expo API is

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:40,590
just to clone an app with it and then to

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,810
walk through how I cloned that app and

00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,669
show you guys how things work I built

00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,160
this natively first with iOS and Android

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:50,370
and then was able to just run it as a

00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:51,990
web app which is really cool I've got

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:54,510
this little demo just in case the Wi-Fi

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,220
didn't work but it is working so I'm

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,680
gonna hop over here this is a website

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,600
it's published now so you can go to it

00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,950
if you want it's called expo gram lfi

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,380
and i'll tweet out all the links

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,050
afterwards but here we can just scroll

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:13,130
through this and oh I see it's not on

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,130
the screen that that is troublesome

00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,450
well luckily I have that video it's

00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:25,320
almost like I planned for things to go

00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:27,690
wrong okay so here's the video of what

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,430
the website looks like again its expo

00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,830
gram that lofaso you can visit it if you

00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:35,099
want and right here this is just a

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,839
standard mobile browser running on an

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:39,150
iphone as you can see it's got a live

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,710
camera feed running it has a blur view

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,390
running on top of that there's nothing

00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,460
special here there's no native modules

00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:46,920
involved it's all just standard browser

00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:49,560
stuff there's no web assembly it's using

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,770
cutting-edge browser features and it's

00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,530
just a recreation of what the Instagram

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:57,490
camera looks like so over here it's also

00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,820
pulling in a bunch of

00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,680
the audio from the iTunes API which can

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,450
stream on top of that there's a lot of

00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,390
very intensive things usually when I

00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,070
show people this demo it's a lot of

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,350
things that maybe they didn't know could

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,550
even be done in a browser before making

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,000
it I didn't actually know they could be

00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:18,130
done in the browser and so we'll kind of

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,580
walk through how it all works so if we

00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:23,680
look at like the profile page it's got a

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,150
lot of these very basic primitive

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,820
elements things like images buttons

00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:30,400
texts all of these are provided by react

00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,680
native so you don't really need anything

00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,440
special to make them but then when you

00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,870
dig into like the camera stream and this

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,570
is my Soylent collection wouldn't you

00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,370
dig into the camera screen it gets a lot

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,520
less forgiving there are so many native

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:49,420
modules in this so we have fonts SVG

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:50,950
audio and you might be thinking like SVG

00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,660
and fonts are very easy to do in the

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,580
browser and you're right

00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,830
they're a lot harder to do natively

00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,830
though and so every single thing that

00:09:56,830 --> 00:10:02,800
you can do needs to have a library which

00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,480
works universally across everything so

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,790
if it's difficult on one platform

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,470
it needs a library so you can make it

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:13,510
work universally and of course there are

00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:16,180
various libraries like AR it's a good

00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:20,470
example that our platform specific a R

00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:23,350
stands for augmented reality and we need

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,240
a way to like get around this platform

00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,340
specific functionality when it's not

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,490
supported so here I've got a pretty

00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:33,310
scientific graph and it shows how AR

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:35,320
probably works in the app I use it for

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,530
like face filters like the dog filter

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,840
and Instagram so here we've got a AR

00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,840
maybe we put it in a file called a rjs

00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,590
and then it renders cool stuff that's

00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,810
computer science so then in web where

00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,390
it's not supported we might have a file

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,550
called the dot web KS and then the

00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:56,740
bundler knows to do some like bundler

00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:57,970
magic and resolve the file with the more

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:01,750
platform-specific

00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:03,940
extension so from a DX perspective it's

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:06,640
pretty straightforward to create and

00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:09,810
then to also circumvent features that

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,579
don't work everywhere and

00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:14,930
a really cool side effect of this is

00:11:11,579 --> 00:11:17,730
that PW azor progressive web apps are

00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:19,259
extremely easy to build with this system

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,459
in fact you don't really need to build

00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:23,249
them at all they just kind of work

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,749
automatically and nowadays a lot of

00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:27,240
people really expect all of this

00:11:24,749 --> 00:11:31,019
functionality in your your website like

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:34,339
offline support and well mostly just

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:37,470
offline support right so if we look at

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:40,050
like this diagram here I think safe area

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,639
view is a really good example of this

00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:43,050
it's something that you don't think

00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,930
about when you actually develop your

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,910
website because you have a URL bar which

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,699
you know prevents you from getting into

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:52,259
the notches but when you make a need of

00:11:50,699 --> 00:11:54,870
that you have to think about the safe

00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:56,910
area all the time and that means that

00:11:54,870 --> 00:12:00,509
all the libraries like navigation they

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:02,730
consider the safe area and lists so if

00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,189
you build a native app and then you run

00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,290
that in the browser when you make a PWA

00:12:05,189 --> 00:12:09,509
it kind of waters down any features

00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:12,059
which aren't available but then you kind

00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,279
of end up with this PWA which looks

00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:16,649
pretty much identical to your native app

00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,059
which is really cool so you get things

00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:19,920
like the splash screen and the app icon

00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:21,899
and offline support all just kind of

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,059
bundled into it by default because it

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:28,379
knows how to do that automatic like you

00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:29,699
already built it in there so let's take

00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,980
a look under the hood really quickly

00:12:29,699 --> 00:12:33,509
that's like a car reference let's take a

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,839
look under the hood and I can explain

00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:39,569
how I got to be easy because it was not

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:45,509
always very easy to use so who here

00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:49,709
knows what a bundler is ok and who here

00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:52,379
knows like how that bundler works nice

00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:54,089
so for the people watching on the stream

00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,610
everyone just raise their hands because

00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:59,240
they can only like see my face but I

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,259
will explain how a bundler works so

00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,149
essentially a bundler is like the build

00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,189
step for your project it's going to take

00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:08,459
all the files and put them in one big

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:10,110
file and then it will remove all of the

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:12,540
code that you're not using or at least

00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:14,879
it will tell you that and then it will

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,429
minify it and break it out into smaller

00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,850
files so there's a lot that can go wrong

00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:23,560
there in that build step and

00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,940
something that I found like maybe the

00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,050
only thing more inconvenient than

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:32,320
working with a bundler is working with

00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:34,270
two bumblers and react native it uses

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,210
this bundler called Metro which is a

00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,980
custom bundler made at Facebook and it

00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,170
exists and then the rest of the react

00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,020
native or the react community uses web

00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,120
pack like Next and Gatsby in story but

00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:49,270
create react app everyone I love what

00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,370
pack it's awesome so for the web

00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,020
projects we use web pack and then for

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,910
the native projects we use a totally

00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:56,800
different Mugler so getting that

00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:59,290
configuration to be right can be tricky

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,570
and as much as I love web pack it does

00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,170
have kind of an issue with it and that

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:07,270
issue is that it's very difficult to use

00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,850
there is a lot of configuration and if

00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:12,430
you want to get started with react

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,320
native or web you need to remove all of

00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,150
the iOS and Android code from your

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,340
project all that happens in the bundler

00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,720
you need to remap react native to react

00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,610
native web so you kind of need to have

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,890
like a pretty thorough understanding of

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,780
how web pack works even just to like get

00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,880
started using it whereas with Next and

00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:29,020
Gatsby you don't really ever touch the

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:31,390
web pack home fail unless you need to

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,550
and then to add on top of that if you

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:35,350
wanted to use reenter for web with any

00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,060
of your favorite tools which why

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:39,130
wouldn't you they're awesome

00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:41,860
you have to now take their proprietary

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,080
config and mix it with your config and

00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:45,460
so that pretty much just requires a very

00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:48,820
thorough understanding of how it all

00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:51,160
works so maybe you can kind of start to

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,530
see why it hasn't really taken off as

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,640
much as it should've or bigger companies

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:57,370
where they've got very talented

00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,530
engineers why they love using it and

00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:02,440
then anyone passively using it for a

00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:04,150
side project is not picking it up but

00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,120
doesn't need to be that way right we can

00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:07,990
make it easier so I actually have a

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,240
thing here

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,910
where I can demonstrate how easy it is

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:19,060
but I don't know if I'll be able to get

00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:21,480
the showing probably go over here near

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,480
the screen

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,570
cool

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,100
all right there is that den I was gonna

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:37,800
show you earlier so right here this is a

00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,590
website called snack Expo if you're

00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:43,080
familiar with code sandbox or code pen

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,330
or jsfiddle it's a code editor and the

00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,090
browser the only difference is this one

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,010
is it lets you write native apps in fact

00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:52,380
this is probably the easiest way to make

00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,230
native apps because you can just hit

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,270
this URL and start coding them but we

00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,830
added the web feature to it and if I

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,530
open up the file browser over here you

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:03,600
see there is no web pack config no Babel

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,700
config you can add them and then start

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,650
extending it but you do not need that by

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,240
default all of that functionality has

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:11,490
very meaningful defaults and you can

00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,250
build on top of it

00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,990
and then you can just start coding it

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,080
live in the browser so I can you know

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,690
add a bunch of random junk and it'll

00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,850
update over here or if I wanted to add a

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,490
camera like I could import the primitive

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:30,510
import camera from Expo camera and then

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:34,260
just export that object like that JSX I

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:37,680
can actually open this one over here and

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:40,410
like another browser window and just

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,300
like that it is now running a universal

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:45,120
camera which runs the same way on iOS

00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,560
Android and web and any other platform

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,640
which Expo chooses to support that's a

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,890
really bad angle of me so it's that

00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,170
simple to just use these primitives just

00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:58,740
roll them into production if I kind of

00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:03,300
add this back maybe I'll like add the

00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,890
camera in here oh dang it

00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:10,020
I forgot I can't code when people are

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:11,940
watching so add the camera and then

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,730
maybe I'll add like the blur view on top

00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,140
of it I say maybe but it's commented out

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:23,730
here so you definitely know I planned

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:25,530
this ahead of time so I'm gonna just add

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,530
a blur view on top of the camera just to

00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:31,410
kind of demonstrate how simple it is to

00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:34,590
do a lot of this stuff open this up in

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,120
another thing over here you don't

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,779
usually need to open up the second

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:47,420
browser window to do this

00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:49,080
this is just unique to streaming it and

00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:52,029
[Music]

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:56,409
let's start cutting out features till we

00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:58,899
get to the working space so here's the

00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:01,679
camera working and then if I add a blur

00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:04,210
view on top of that now it is blurry and

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,369
as you can see you can just kind of

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,279
construct these advanced primitives all

00:18:06,369 --> 00:18:13,059
on top of each other and it's a very

00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,859
simple very easy to use system so I'm

00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:18,159
gonna jump back over to the presentation

00:18:14,859 --> 00:18:19,599
now for a second well actually well I

00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:21,549
have it open I'll just show you some

00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,919
like examples how this works so like

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:26,309
here's a game that I made with Expo Webb

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,469
it's really cool it's called Crossy Road

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:35,649
it's based off another game that already

00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:37,419
exists which yeah so I cloned this using

00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:39,580
it just kind of to demonstrate that you

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,529
don't like it's not limited to UI is you

00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:43,210
could also build games using any of the

00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:44,710
awesome game tools that already exists

00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,099
so like this one's made with three J s

00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:49,570
and I fall into the water and these are

00:18:48,099 --> 00:18:51,219
all react native views that come on top

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,159
of it and it's very bright and colorful

00:18:51,219 --> 00:18:56,200
so you can make really any kind of thing

00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:58,899
that you want with it and this runs the

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,190
same way for iOS Android and web I tried

00:18:58,899 --> 00:19:01,690
to put it in the App Store but as you

00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,450
can imagine they did not approve it

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,589
because it is a copyrighted thing

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:11,489
already so now I'm going to switch back

00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,489
over to the keynote

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:25,260
that's the part where I talk about the

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,539
video games and now I'm gonna talk about

00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,059
what is next so what can we do with this

00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:31,350
where's the road map where where do we

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,620
want to go with this in the future in

00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:36,390
the first place is just stability right

00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:38,520
we want to move it out of beta

00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:40,440
there are still some like open questions

00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,299
about things which don't make a lot of

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,570
sense universally the biggest one is

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,830
just navigation because navigation for

00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:50,549
mobile apps is very different from

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,350
navigation and web apps like here we've

00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:55,470
got stack navigators we've got tab

00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:57,360
navigators these are all way different

00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:58,980
than routing because like a stack

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,710
navigator you kind of load all the pages

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,809
into memory whereas with a web page you

00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:06,690
just switch to whichever page you want

00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:09,270
another cool native navigation thing is

00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:11,159
shared element transitions which is when

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,659
you take one element on the page and you

00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,850
move to another page and that element

00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:16,200
comes with you this is something which

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,130
is a part of Expo it's in this library

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,450
react meter shared element and it's

00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:23,730
already in react native so it would not

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,190
be too difficult to add it to web and it

00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:29,429
is I mean it looks awesome

00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:32,669
and it's got like anime so I would also

00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:36,330
like to have it working in web I'm just

00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:39,630
like going forward from there Expo kind

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,659
of made it very easy - probably the

00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,580
easiest ever to build an iOS and an

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,919
Android app using the same code base as

00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,700
well and now with web you can render to

00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:54,390
all of these new browsers and all these

00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:57,659
new targets can run your app and it's

00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,549
not too difficult to see how you can add

00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:02,909
desktop support from there maybe using

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:04,890
electron or project catalyst which is

00:21:02,909 --> 00:21:08,130
Apple's new way of running iOS code on

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,620
OS X and then just building out from

00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:14,760
there there's a lot of ways that you can

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:17,820
add and extend this but whenever you add

00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,830
a new platform to expo your existing

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,440
expo app it doesn't need to be updated

00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,330
in any way right it just that same

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,789
primitive code will apply to whichever

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,740
platform expo supports i like to think

00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,780
of it like when you write a JavaScript

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:32,970
app you don't think if it like targets

00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:35,700
ya or something you just know that if it

00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:39,600
runs on Chrome then it will run wherever

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,400
chrome runs and it runs like that except

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,630
fully natively with access to all

00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:48,000
browser and Dom features so anyways in

00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,679
summation that is why I think Expo now

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,159
with the addition of web is how people

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,730
can truly write their apps once and run

00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,510
them everywhere and that's all I got for

00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:00,030
you guys today

00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:01,650
thanks so much for listening you guys

00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:03,150
have been great I'm gonna be around

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:04,919
answering questions

00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:08,580
I'll also tweet out the link to the

00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,539
slide and to all the websites and things

00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,510
that I mentioned in this presentation

00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:17,179
and yeah if you guys there any questions

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:17,179
feel free to let me know I'm talking out

00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:23,370
here now there were seven bacon I'm

00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,409
gonna come here I want you to see what

00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:27,750
he is wearing for his shoes oh yeah

00:22:25,409 --> 00:22:29,520
that's the real dedication to our cause

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,409
here so thank you for that's what I was

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,620
doing I know we have two questions for

00:22:31,409 --> 00:22:36,299
you dude it's asking so expo is nice to

00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,299
show confidence but what is about

00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:41,450
routing react router is that possible or

00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:43,710
will its route to a different domain

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:47,789
what's that asked before the navigation

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:49,590
part I think there is so like this kind

00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:52,860
of open question around like how routing

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,750
will work with native navigation but I

00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,179
think that there is something that we

00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:58,860
use called a switch navigator we're also

00:22:57,179 --> 00:23:00,929
investigating more lightweight options

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,789
besides react router but currently the

00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:05,730
way I recommend people do things the way

00:23:02,789 --> 00:23:07,559
that um a lot of websites are using Expo

00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,480
Webber now is they are just using react

00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:11,280
router for web and then they're using a

00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,580
native solution like rack navigation for

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:16,590
their native router and it works for

00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,679
them and then we have a second question

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:22,590
are your implementations of Instagram

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,480
and press routes open source course of

00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:27,030
course it's all open source I'll tweet

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,409
out links to it the people who make

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,539
cross the road have asked me to take it

00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:34,440
down a lot so maybe they will often see

00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:36,240
this but the Instagram one is it's open

00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:38,640
source as well and it's all I might get

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,059
hub and you can just get all that code

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,070
there

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,279
I don't really close source anything or

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:44,090
even have a

00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:48,320
Pro github account

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:48,320
