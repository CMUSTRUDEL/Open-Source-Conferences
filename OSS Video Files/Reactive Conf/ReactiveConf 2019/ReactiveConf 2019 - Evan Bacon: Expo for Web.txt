Progressive web apps can be difficult to support, hard to test, and _unfortunate_ to maintain. With Expo for web you can maximize code sharing between your native and web apps. The robust set of Unimodules provides you with unified APIs for things like camera, gestures, image picker, persistent storage, and more. Optimized for performance, Expo’s Babel preset enables you to do advanced tree-shaking which removes all unused platform code. New universal testing libraries make it easy to ensure your app is running as expected on all platforms. Expo web also provides a set of Webpack plugins for adding offline support and automatic generation of PWA assets. I’ll be discussing this, and possibly some future plans for supporting things like universal navigation, SSR, and connected applications with things like apple site association.
