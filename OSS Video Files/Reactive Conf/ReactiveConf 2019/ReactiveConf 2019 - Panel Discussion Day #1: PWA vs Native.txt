hi I'm Kyle Matthews I've founded Gatsby

00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:24,950
they got to be jeaious react website

00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:29,410
framework and so yeah it's very much on

00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:32,270
the the website I have things I'm Evan

00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:34,970
bacon I work at Expo I work on a project

00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,940
called Expo for web which takes react

00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:40,190
native for web and makes it kind of more

00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:42,020
accessible to people and rounds it out I

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,510
also work on like making that work with

00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,880
Gatsby but before that I spent years as

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:51,230
a native developer so I guess I'm just

00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,460
like conflicted hi I'm Nick Alaina

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,680
Huebner I work at a place called

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,760
development seed prior to that I worked

00:00:54,680 --> 00:01:01,550
heavily with Web Apps and so I'm more on

00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,190
the webapp side and work on client

00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:09,229
projects with people like NASA and World

00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:10,640
Bank currently hi everyone I'm Ryan I'm

00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:13,789
working as a software engineer at Google

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,830
in a team called Android games so you

00:01:13,789 --> 00:01:17,840
will say am on the native side well

00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:20,930
actually depends I'm very interesting

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,869
all that the web can do and I've been

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:26,479
doing this game editor that is a part

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:30,619
C++ pub JavaScript and that is running

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,240
yeah well either web browser cool so

00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,360
maybe we can start off by kind of

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,920
defining terms a little bit so I'm

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,240
curious about say for example

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:44,240
progressive web apps so with Kyle I mean

00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,770
does Gatsby I think espouses itself as a

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,659
progressive web app framework of source

00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:50,270
is that right yeah that's a really good

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:52,280
way to describe it all right so but it's

00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:53,990
also a static site generator so we put

00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,619
in some code we get static HTML on the

00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,360
outs on the other side very similar to

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:03,140
say like Odin old geo cities or like

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,880
Angel Fire web sites yeah all right so

00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,380
what what those also qualify as

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,299
progressive web apps or like how would

00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:11,480
you define a progressive web app yeah

00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:14,060
the idea I mean the term progressive web

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:16,310
app is like it kind of progresses where

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,900
a straight web app it just is purely

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:20,900
client-side we're progressive it's sort

00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,209
of like starts as a you know kind of

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,760
static HTML version of the app and then

00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:29,480
it kind of like hydrates into a full

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,580
we'll a nap so I got to be you create a

00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,530
react app but then for each page in your

00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,590
site at Build time we like pre-render

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,870
that to an HTML page and so when you

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:41,360
know a user loads of gossipy site they

00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,769
first get the HTML so the site you know

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,500
like you know pixels appear on the

00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:47,150
screen as quickly as possible but then

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,709
the JavaScript comes in to hydrate that

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,930
into you know your normal react

00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,489
components you react up so it kind of is

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,290
like the whole idea of progressive web

00:02:52,489 --> 00:02:55,819
app is the best of both worlds of both

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,650
like the website world and the web app

00:02:55,819 --> 00:03:00,530
world that you get you know kind of like

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:02,209
fast lightweight loading but then all

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,640
the sort of like app like stuff you want

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:06,890
to do like servers workers and like kind

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,010
of rich client-side interactions are

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:12,049
straight part as well so I mean I think

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:13,970
my SEO is also kind of a concern there

00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:15,739
right where web apps kind of live and

00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,120
die by their ability for Google to find

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,739
them and index them and send them

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,200
customers

00:03:18,739 --> 00:03:22,670
makiura is kind of on the expo side

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,220
right whenever you're compiling out

00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:27,049
these are expose exclusively for apps

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,879
presumably like that is the primary

00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:31,450
target they're like how do you see expo

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,120
kind of existing inside of the PWA world

00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:37,250
so now with the expo for web you can

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,919
build a website but you also take that

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,329
same existing like native code and you

00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,329
turn that into a website so there's a

00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:46,849
lot of features which make a lot more

00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,980
sense in a PWA than they do in a web app

00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,340
and they kind of get like watered down

00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,389
and create this very optimal PWA so

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:55,040
example I really like is like the safe

00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:57,349
area view where if you take a lot of

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,630
websites and you render them as pedo

00:03:57,349 --> 00:04:01,639
buoys usually if the phone has like a

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,959
notch you see that the UI gets cut off

00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,150
and they're like maybe the splash screen

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,970
doesn't load or the offline doesn't make

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:09,109
sense just right out of the box you

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,599
don't really get any of those problems

00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:13,459
with expo web because you have to create

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,889
a splash screen for a native app and you

00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:18,169
have to account for the safe area view

00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:21,139
in a native app and so these things just

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:22,760
like carry over but it's also all an

00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:24,650
application very similar to like create

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,900
react app and it's less of like a

00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,240
pre-rendered system

00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,430
it's like an entire app like it starts

00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,310
very much on the app side without maybe

00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,260
the progressive parts yeah I mean you

00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,880
don't necessarily need the recursive

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:39,140
parts because it is just like fully

00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,120
native it has access

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:43,370
to all of the native device features and

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,250
then it kind of removes whichever parts

00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,570
aren't available like for instance there

00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,820
is some weirdness where if you have a

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:52,070
native app on iOS and it has access to

00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,930
the camera and you load that in the

00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,610
Safari browser you still have access to

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,250
the camera but if you turn that into a

00:04:55,610 --> 00:05:01,880
PW a now it loses access to the camera

00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,640
for whatever reason so it really just

00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,960
based like each feature works

00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,160
differently based off wherever it's

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,200
being run interesting and then I think

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,410
kind of carries on on your side so you

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,360
are maybe more native than a lot of the

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,680
rest of us right so you you're working

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,900
on a system that works deeply with

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,240
native systems yeah well I started by

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,670
being mostly working on native stuff but

00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,040
on desktop before seeing the web as a

00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:32,540
huge opportunity for which you know to

00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,650
more people and yeah I think that when

00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,510
we are speaking about progressive web

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,010
apps what I like it's the term

00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:39,080
progressive and it's a fact that it's a

00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:43,630
spectrum of progressive web apps you can

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:46,310
have a new news content website that is

00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:49,850
only interested in having something that

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:53,390
it's already fast to load and and you

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:55,220
can also go more on the apps side and

00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:57,710
have something that is maybe a bit

00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:59,240
longer to load but still working very

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:01,430
well and taking advantage of everything

00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,920
that you have on your phone so that's

00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:08,480
what I like the progressive web apps

00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:11,510
approach and in a way I mean they are

00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:14,300
they are people trying to improve things

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:16,520
for apps like we have the Google Instant

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,200
apps on Android that are trying to

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,350
minimize the size of the app so that

00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:25,240
they can load already quickly but I

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:31,160
think that the privacy webs are a great

00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:33,860
great way to make things more - to load

00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,100
seamlessly yeah and to still provide

00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:39,350
something that looks like an app out of

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,510
here I'll say I mean is there a way that

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,190
you approach a project and you decide

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,950
whether you want to go native or

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,120
progressive web app are there certain

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,010
feature sets that you say well this is

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,900
going to have to hit these performance

00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:52,310
marks and so it should be native or has

00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,230
to be accessible to these people so it

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,070
should be

00:06:53,230 --> 00:07:02,630
here's how each of you kind of

00:06:55,070 --> 00:07:05,570
approaches the distinction here so for

00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,730
in my experience it's a variation of the

00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,430
resources the timeline and the users

00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,050
that are going to be accessing it

00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,740
depending on what you have available to

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:17,360
you it it might make a lot of sense to

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,220
make a progressive web app rather than a

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,710
web app and a native app due to the

00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:24,200
amount of resources required to do both

00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:26,780
of them and if you're trying to get your

00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,570
app on the phones of users in remote

00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:31,700
environments for example that the data

00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:33,860
usage that a progressive web app

00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,810
requires versus a native app if the

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,240
functionality is not too heavy you can

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,370
make a lot of sense so is there anything

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,230
to do with maybe I mean the different

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,120
markets difference maybe internet speeds

00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:45,680
and that kind of thing so would you

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,300
choose say for example and they dip app

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:52,100
and market say like India versus a

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,440
progressive web app or would it be vice

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,770
versa um so I've found that progressive

00:07:54,440 --> 00:08:00,770
web apps are very good for likely loaves

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,750
internet speeds and the data usage is a

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,790
big part of it because progressive web

00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,560
apps are lighter than native apps or

00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,630
they can be and I think a lot of

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,210
companies are choosing to create both

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,400
depending on the needs of the user and

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,110
so also if you're working on emerging

00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,870
markets and trying to identify the needs

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,120
of the user it's much easier to iterate

00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,430
with a progressive web app where native

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,800
you have to constantly get those

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,970
refreshes so iteration cycle might be

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,430
another very important consideration

00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:30,950
then yeah exactly how fast you're moving

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:35,570
and why you're making those changes for

00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:39,520
which user groups like yours don't match

00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:41,960
up well with the expo web kind of the

00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,210
target idea is that you don't have to

00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:45,500
decide or choose anymore like if you

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,840
need to build an app or a website you

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,790
just make one and then it runs on a

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,650
false dichotomy we don't have to even

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,410
make this choice yeah right right so

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,960
just you make it as optimally as you can

00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:59,720
and then it's up to the platform that

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,400
you're running it on to like at work as

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,750
well as I can and if you have something

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,250
where there's a complex gesture or

00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,220
interaction and maybe it doesn't work as

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:07,740
well on the web

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,089
it doesn't mean as much as it used to

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:11,670
because you can always just run it

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:14,310
natively and now it works exactly as you

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:16,410
expected it to the same with like data

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:20,819
usage and offline support and things of

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,500
that nature so one of the challenge I

00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:23,730
think with maybe progressive web apps in

00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,899
general right so this is certainly an

00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,790
area where I think most of the audience

00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:28,050
and me included feel much more

00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,569
comfortable right than maybe on the

00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,160
native side but they often do seem like

00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:33,509
they are much more limited in terms of

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,399
the feature set that they have access to

00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:36,629
right so native iOS apps can do some

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,009
really cool things that are maybe not

00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:42,540
exposed inside of saying mobile safari

00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:44,370
how do you see those restrictions kind

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,610
of playing into progressive web apps and

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:49,110
like do you see hope in the future for

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:52,250
more of this functionality being exposed

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,839
to mobile apps or mobile web apps I

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:58,139
would just say that sometimes true for

00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,589
sure but I think it's like like complex

00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:04,680
functionality that nobody uses is not as

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:05,639
interesting because I said the big

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,649
advantage of the web has is just

00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:11,430
distribution it's like it's a lot more

00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:13,350
people it's way way easier to just like

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,329
get somebody to open up a link versus

00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:19,589
and so on and an app on their phone so

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:21,269
you know the like and most functionality

00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:24,180
the most apps need are it's great on the

00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:27,569
web and where I see kind of the

00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:30,329
distinction is that native apps win for

00:10:27,569 --> 00:10:32,579
kind of more complex apps that have like

00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:34,589
deeper ongoing engagement with users

00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:37,380
because then if they're gonna be using

00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:39,810
it a bunch then it's like not as hard to

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:41,939
convince them to install it and so forth

00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,589
and like the kind of the improved

00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:45,779
experience you know pays off over time

00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,209
where if somebody's probably only you

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,089
know you something to three times and

00:10:48,209 --> 00:10:53,160
then go about their lives then the the

00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:55,139
ease of them you know starting to use it

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,610
matters a lot more than whether if it's

00:10:55,139 --> 00:10:57,870
technically something you know 20

00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,959
percent smoother or something in a

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,730
native app does that end up reflecting

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,769
on maybe the types of businesses that

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,949
can succeed and the web versus in the

00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:10,410
native space yeah absolutely I mean you

00:11:07,949 --> 00:11:12,660
know the apps that are popular like

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,480
photo apps and communication apps and

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,850
social networking app stores and that

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,920
sort of stuff and those are things are

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:25,949
you know use daily hourly type thing by

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,649
lots of people but you know ecommerce

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:30,810
apps for example are extremely uncommon

00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:32,160
to get much traction almost everyone

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:33,870
just goes to the web site like Amazon

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,569
keeps bugging me to install their app

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:39,240
and I'm still like yeah whatever you

00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:40,889
know type thing would make basil's very

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,339
happy if you did though I think he'd be

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,310
very happy he's probably happy it's

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,949
probably the PM that's mad so Brian I

00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,050
mean you are working on the extreme

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:53,370
native side here right you're gone all

00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,990
the way back to the basics and you're

00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,860
like windowing systems they're no good

00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,540
I'm OpenGL how do you kind of think

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,160
about whenever you're building this

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:03,600
system framework that's a bit like

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,209
exponent its ability to target both

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,389
native and web how do you kind of think

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:11,069
about least common denominator problems

00:12:09,389 --> 00:12:13,350
and providing a good experience on both

00:12:11,069 --> 00:12:16,050
sides yeah it's a good question sorry I

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,940
was late to the party here but actually

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,850
have experience building Cordova apps

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,889
and electron apps at Microsoft I worked

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,350
on a team that shipped power apps and

00:12:22,889 --> 00:12:28,769
another team that shipped and I've

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,000
called gig jam and I think like the most

00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:32,009
important thing is to use the right tool

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,509
for the job like you need to ship

00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:35,279
something that works for your customers

00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:37,740
and something that they can use and that

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839
makes them happy so I might not go to

00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,790
the lengths that I went for own even for

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,209
like other classes of apps because it's

00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,350
just like the what you get for that

00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:48,480
maybe doesn't make sense for that user

00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:49,470
base so I think you have to pick the

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,220
right tool for the job

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:55,050
and then in designing I think reverie UI

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,420
and well not in itself you've have

00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,269
targeted the ability to hit also the web

00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,250
as well as native is that right yep but

00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,139
we thought about like the web as more of

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,029
like a rapid prototyping experience more

00:13:04,139 --> 00:13:08,790
so than a full-fledged platform that you

00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:11,430
chip on so like you could build a

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:13,170
reverie app in the web and then it would

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,339
translate over to native code but

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,319
there's a lot of things missing to

00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,060
actually make a fully production ready

00:13:16,319 --> 00:13:21,360
app in that environment things like

00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,160
accessibility so we really view that

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,110
more as like a rapid prototyping

00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,079
experience and something that you could

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,990
ship on the web with I mean kind of

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,710
along those lines I'm curious about

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,440
accessibility is like a real interest

00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:35,970
topic I think right where it's partially

00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,790
built into the web there are definitely

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,589
you know attributes you can add to

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,390
individual elements and whatnot but it's

00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:45,089
it's kind of a first class concern in

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:47,550
many ways for maybe native apps I mean

00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:49,020
here's how you address accessibility in

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,080
the progress of web app world or if

00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,279
that's not even a concern on your side

00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:55,740
what I found that at least the

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,399
accessibility is better supported by

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,740
default on native hubs meaning that when

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:04,470
i ported my patient from a desktop app

00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:06,209
to browser hub I had people telling me

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,640
oh it was walking with a screen reader

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,680
before it's not the case anymore that's

00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,779
clearly something that I missed while

00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:15,959
doing the changes this being said with

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:18,690
the new approach of components using the

00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,300
rialto any other 410 framework or react

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,670
native I think that we can there again

00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,649
do better that in native because you can

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,080
build accessibility into your component

00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:30,560
into your design system and then you

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,880
have for free and a consistent

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,850
accessibility experience in the develop

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,860
so we might not be there yet under term

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,250
not an expert on it but I think that we

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,650
can do better I mean part of it seems to

00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,290
come from maybe the chaotic nature of

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:48,360
the web right where Apple has its walled

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,950
garden and it may be walled but it is a

00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,709
beautiful garden right like they provide

00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,760
you with nice tools and and whatnot

00:14:51,709 --> 00:14:56,010
whereas the web has kind of competing

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,880
actors inside of it and so you have to

00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:58,260
get everyone to agree on how

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,440
accessibility is done and what they're

00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:04,080
using reacts or angular or what not how

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,190
do you kind of contend with the chaos

00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:13,620
whenever your shipping these

00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:15,180
applications you don't know one yeah I

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,520
definitely agree the characterization

00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:19,740
that the web is chaotic when it comes to

00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,230
accessibility I mean we did a lot of

00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,790
we've done a lot of research around

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:27,089
Gatsby how gatsby works with different

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,279
screen readers and it just works

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,899
differently like some some work exactly

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,899
as we expect you know you change a route

00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:38,250
and the screen reader announces that and

00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:40,020
then I think Firefox doesn't in like

00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:42,000
Safari I forget exactly what Safari does

00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,670
something goofy where like chrome and

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,340
Windows and works I believe anyway so I

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:48,790
mean this is

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,760
thing that we just made another hire for

00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,350
like OSS team that's working spending a

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,300
lot of her time on you know kind of

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:56,800
digging into this and it might just end

00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,900
up that we have to you know to make

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,060
JavaScript progressive abouts really

00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:03,100
actually work with screen readers we

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:04,660
have to you know start making patches to

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,850
the screeners themselves or something

00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:10,090
like that to get things work another

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:14,380
sign of hope I think to kind of contain

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:15,520
contain the chaos of this is that you

00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:18,190
know more and more kind of react

00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,680
component libraries are baking in good

00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,850
accessibility defaults from the start

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,520
and this is great because you know that

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,420
gives you an even better baseline so

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,820
that you know you have these complex

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,620
widgets but someone's done a really

00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,610
thorough job of making sure that they're

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:40,210
accessible to you know various types of

00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:43,630
disabilities so I think that that's sort

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:46,510
of the future of things is that you know

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:48,700
more and more we use frameworks like

00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,680
Gatsby which you know we do everything

00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,720
we can to mix you know apps accessible

00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,070
and then you know the component

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,080
libraries we use is kind of the base for

00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,610
applications are also doing the right

00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:59,770
thing under the hood and so as long as

00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,180
we don't you know inadvertently screw

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:06,370
something up on top then we're in a

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:08,170
pretty good spot so react native web has

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,850
a really interesting accessibility

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,190
pattern built into it in the sense that

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,870
if you make like a text element right if

00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:17,350
you're using that component it will

00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,630
render by default like a span like HTML

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:22,270
element but if you set the accessibility

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,640
role to header then all of a sudden out

00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:26,920
renders an h1 and then if you set the

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,680
like Aria level to two now it's

00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,390
rendering an h2 so with react native for

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,830
web what it tried to do what it does

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:34,330
like pretty well is it takes

00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,610
accessibility and it makes it less of

00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,600
this like add-on and it makes it more of

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,490
like a building block like a

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,310
foundational building block to accessing

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:44,470
really core important parts of your like

00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,850
semantic HTML which i think is really

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,420
interesting because if you want to go

00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:51,820
about adding these components which you

00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,890
normally do then you kind of do that via

00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,360
the accessibility and then because it's

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,680
react native that accessibility is now

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:02,180
universal and applies to your iOS and

00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,610
Android screen readers so I think like

00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,170
what cow said a lot of interesting

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,770
accessibility patterns are kind of

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,240
coming from the component library level

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,160
to make it accessible once and then it's

00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:20,060
it's accessible everywhere kind of thing

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:21,680
yeah a dream so I mean accessibility is

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,380
maybe one instance here there are also

00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:26,720
other areas where I feel like native app

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:29,060
development is maybe has some advantages

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,610
over the web so you have things like

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,650
interface builder or Swift UI where you

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:35,270
know there's a very well-funded company

00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,560
that is able to hone these tools very

00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:39,080
nicely

00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,240
are there certain areas where you wish

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,710
the web and progressive web apps were

00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:44,780
able they were more capable they had

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:47,720
access to better tooling or better

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,390
capabilities most of just the

00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,910
capabilities like notifications and

00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:55,970
keeping the screen open and things like

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,250
that or would be nice but a lot of that

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,040
is very limiting by the manufacturer

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,450
like if you had access to all native

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,220
functionality there's a very low chance

00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,900
that you would go about building native

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,440
apps for the majority of your

00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,390
applications so I know that a lot of

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,610
reasons why people would go with

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,980
building a native app instead of a PWA

00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:19,820
is that inability to use notifications

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:23,510
on iOS which is very core to a lot of

00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:25,100
apps so if that were available I think a

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:26,960
lot of people just wouldn't they'd skip

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:28,880
right over the native functionality part

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,330
which I would imagine Apple does not

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,000
necessarily want at all I think that we

00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:37,610
would have less this debate if also PWA

00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,510
and web apps in general we're into the

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:41,900
App Store's

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:44,120
meaning that one thing that I don't like

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,640
what I'm making a PWA it's okay it's

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,650
fine but could I get this into the App

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,990
Store or the Play Store because it's

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:55,910
something that people go to it's just

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:57,590
natural and that would make the web apps

00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:59,330
more first-class citizen if they're well

00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:00,560
next to native apps I think that that

00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,840
support it would be almost an

00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,090
implementation detail like have you made

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,870
a policy web app or a native app or I

00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:07,610
don't care

00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,870
as a user I don't care because it's in

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:13,870
the store still it's not the case but

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:16,929
evolving with the trusted web activities

00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:20,200
by Google for the Playstore but it's

00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:22,749
still an ongoing process all the things

00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,490
like access to kind of easy payments so

00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:25,990
there are you know as much as as a user

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,820
I may not like in-app purchases I think

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:29,440
a lot of app developers like in-app

00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,970
purchases and this is the thing that's

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,509
maybe very difficult to build into a

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:35,350
progressive web app are there like other

00:20:33,509 --> 00:20:37,240
capabilities that you you don't even

00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,309
think of normally we're like oh if only

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:42,519
we could do these like where does the

00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:44,049
web have to catch up bluetooth support I

00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:47,309
don't know any apps that use bluetooth

00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:49,480
but people keep asking me for daily

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,970
payments is actually pretty

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,519
straightforward I think in a lot of ways

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:59,289
Apple is like pretty open to accepting

00:20:54,519 --> 00:21:01,419
money but there are a lot of smaller

00:20:59,289 --> 00:21:03,220
things like I know that Chrome has just

00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:04,679
like a list of various features that

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,879
they constantly try to push through

00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,590
bluetooth is definitely one that I get

00:21:06,879 --> 00:21:13,629
requested a lot there is a Bluetooth API

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:15,850
but it lacks a lot of functionality is

00:21:13,629 --> 00:21:17,590
it like a web Bluetooth thing yeah I

00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,559
think people use it for like crypto apps

00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:22,059
like crypto wallet I think yeah it seems

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,519
like the way to make a good technology

00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:31,749
about is to prepend web to it like WebGL

00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:33,580
or web Bluetooth unfortunately so I mean

00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:36,369
one of the concerns I want to be

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:38,259
targeting like native platform so like

00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:39,820
Android or iOS you kind of have to be

00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:41,529
intimately familiar with the hardware

00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:43,659
right and with progressive web apps

00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:45,190
that's usually not the case but I kept

00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:48,490
you found whenever you're trying to

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:50,169
target say some Android devices that

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,149
ends up being something you have to take

00:21:50,169 --> 00:21:53,559
into concern or consideration whatever

00:21:52,149 --> 00:22:00,070
you actually shipping a progressive web

00:21:53,559 --> 00:22:02,649
app yeah I think it comes back to

00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,039
identifying what it is that you're

00:22:02,649 --> 00:22:08,769
trying to make if if you're trying to

00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:11,619
get your app into the hands of your

00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:13,480
users and you have a web app and you can

00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:15,519
just add a certain baseline

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,259
functionalities of that progressive web

00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:20,200
app offers it's a very natural

00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:22,899
progression into that and then you start

00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,909
to hit certain walls as you get into

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:26,999
certain

00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:29,339
domains that I think native has really

00:22:26,999 --> 00:22:32,339
held their ground on and if you already

00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,139
have a native app working or going for

00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:37,319
that I don't think that there's

00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:38,789
necessarily that battleground where

00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:42,709
we're trying to push out native apps

00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:45,899
where they're already firmly situated

00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:48,269
but yeah I think as we get more refined

00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:50,639
api's to access the hardware of the

00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:52,169
phones that will be working with things

00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:54,239
will start to be a little bit more--

00:22:52,169 --> 00:23:01,019
they'll be the ease of transition with

00:22:54,239 --> 00:23:02,429
that I just had a sort of flashbacks to

00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,589
it and I was working on a Cordova app

00:23:02,429 --> 00:23:07,259
which is probably worst experience than

00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:09,149
a PWA right now but dealing with like

00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:11,399
the Android versions was really rough

00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:13,679
like we had the ship on four for five

00:23:11,399 --> 00:23:15,719
and they had different versions of the

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,609
webview baked in and they all had

00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:20,369
different quirks and different bugs and

00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:23,609
it was such a pain I'm like having

00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:25,319
nightmares like reliving that but native

00:23:23,609 --> 00:23:26,729
isn't a free lunch either because you

00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:29,129
know of course Apple will change the API

00:23:26,729 --> 00:23:33,239
service on you and I've changed things

00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:36,119
with Catalina and stuff so really both

00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:37,679
ways have their problems I mean did you

00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:39,479
have to be let's say you were to take

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,069
those cordova apps that you're shipping

00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:42,359
to Android if there had been a

00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,729
progressive web app would that have

00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,169
removed a lot of those concerns I don't

00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:48,209
think so I think it would still be stuck

00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,039
on that browser version so usually it

00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:51,389
was like problems with like layout or

00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:53,669
rendering that were specific to that

00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:56,940
particular version or quirks with the

00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:58,199
JavaScript engine so I think we were

00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,579
kind of stuck with it and maybe it's

00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:03,779
more like an Android problem like I

00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:05,579
guess along those lines have you seen

00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:07,409
kind of gatsby fitting into the the

00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,909
mobile app world so the progressive web

00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:10,829
app in particular that's meant to be

00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:13,229
used on either tablets or Android

00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:14,669
devices are there any special

00:24:13,229 --> 00:24:20,399
considerations that you guys have built

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:21,989
into it not really I mean responsive you

00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:25,289
know the responsive websites whatever

00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:28,259
media queries and whatnot have been a

00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:31,739
thing for a while now and so most people

00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:34,979
building for the web with Gatsby you

00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:36,210
know just sort of you know that's a

00:24:34,979 --> 00:24:37,890
pretty well understood art

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:39,810
for doing that the main thing that you

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:41,520
know Gatsby helps is that we just do

00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:45,410
everything we can to make your your

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:47,730
website at SAP as fast as it can and so

00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:50,970
which is like the main thing for for

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,920
making the website work on different

00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,740
versions of phones and tablets and so

00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:58,710
forth is is you know the slower it is

00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,850
the fewer you're just cutting off kind

00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,380
of the bottom end of the market so

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:03,180
whether people on bad networks or slow

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:07,260
phones you know then it becomes unusable

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,970
and so you know we do do we do a lot of

00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,370
things to to make things fast like you

00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:13,170
know you know the HTML loading in HT no

00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:15,060
first loading you know code splitting by

00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:17,460
default and stuff like that so you can

00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:19,530
just basically effectively embrace the

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,380
platform and things should work well

00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:24,840
yeah generally speaking yeah there is

00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:26,070
like the definite ability to make slow

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,900
sites like how we like to say is like

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,430
most frameworks you know you kind of

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:32,190
make your site fast where the Gatsby

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:34,470
it's like it starts fast and you can

00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:36,120
make it slow but if you just kind of

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,400
like use the defaults and so forth it's

00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:39,900
generally quite fast well I'm a curious

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,540
if there are any kind of closing

00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:47,000
thoughts for me the panelists yeah I

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:49,890
just thought of a list of features that

00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,430
W is so you've got contacts like reading

00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:52,080
and writing

00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,570
you've got calendars like reading and

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:59,310
writing the native photo gallery you

00:25:54,570 --> 00:26:00,870
can't read or write to it and then kind

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:01,950
of just things of those nature where

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,600
it's all these like nice to have

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,550
features which if you have like a social

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,800
network it imports your contacts and you

00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,390
can see all those features I think what

00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,500
happens is people build their app and

00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,060
then they get to the part where they

00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:14,460
want to make it like a really nice

00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:17,040
comprehensive experience and then those

00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,950
things don't exist and that's just like

00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,270
a dead stop and then they have to go and

00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,700
create a native app and I think that's

00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:26,040
usually where people tend to end if they

00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:28,260
start very optimistically and do you see

00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,820
like one manufacturer say is Apple or

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:31,740
Google more incentivize to add one of

00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:32,880
these than the other or is it just both

00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,040
of the Martinson device to keep their

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,320
native walled gardens yeah it seems like

00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,510
the chrome team really wants to like add

00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,430
all these features they do lots of talks

00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:45,720
about adding the features and they

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:47,450
really push the bar thing cool any other

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,429
closing thoughts then

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,729
do we have cause to be hopeful about

00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:55,339
pwace or they like already like the the

00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:57,529
golden standard I think that you can be

00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:59,239
a fool for them and that yeah if if

00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:01,009
there would be in a lapsed oh no but you

00:26:59,239 --> 00:27:03,469
will see the difference again so that's

00:27:01,009 --> 00:27:06,679
that would be a great improvement if we

00:27:03,469 --> 00:27:08,779
can get this at some point all right I

00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:10,399
think that's about time thank you very

00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:12,589
much please think of the the panelists

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:13,610

00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:17,610
it

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:21,800
