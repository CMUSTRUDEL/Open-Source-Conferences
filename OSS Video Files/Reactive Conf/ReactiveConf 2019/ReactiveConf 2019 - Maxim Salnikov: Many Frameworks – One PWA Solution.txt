How does PWA concept play with YOUR favorite framework? React, Angular, Vue, #FrameworkOfTheWeek? In my technical session, we’ll check what major frameworks creators prepared for us regarding scaffolding / adding PWA features (spoiler: only basic features), and switch to Workbox. We’ll see that Workbox is a library providing many sophisticated service worker features in a simple, developer-friendly form. Also, we’ll talk about another advantage of Workbox – the flexibility: you build your own service worker and automate some tasks using this library. As the outcome, you’ll be ready to make a production-ready PWA from the app built on any framework.
