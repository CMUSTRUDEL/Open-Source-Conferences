Sketching in the Browser

Keeping developers and designers in sync is an ongoing challenge for our industry, with each discipline working in completely different mediums. In the past few years, we've seen mass adoption of component systems with locally-scoped styles, which has led directly to the emergence of tools like react-sketchapp and html-sketchapp that allow us to generate static design assets from real production code. Now, we're beginning to see a real feedback loop from development back into designâ€”but what does this mean for traditional design processes? What does this mean for the future of front-end development? In this talk, Mark began to answer these questions by running through a real-world example of this technique, had a closer look at how it all works, and showed you how you can start experimenting with this yourself.
