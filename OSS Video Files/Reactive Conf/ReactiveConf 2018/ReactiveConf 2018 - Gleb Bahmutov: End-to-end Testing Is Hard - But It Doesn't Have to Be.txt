End-to-end Testing Is Hard - But It Doesn't Have to Be

Cypress.io is an open source free end-to-end test runner that runs your web application inside an iframe in a browser it can closely control. This architecture completely changes how your tests behave (hint: no flake), what you can test (pretty much everything), and why you write more e2e tests (because you love writing them). In this talk, I will give a very brief intro into Cypress itself but mostly will concentrate on how it changes the entire testing experience. Cypress users can test web applications by observing just the external behavior (DOM, network calls, storage) or can reach deep inside the application's code, and I will explain the trade-offs. Finally, I will discuss why Cypress tests do not use "async / await" keywords, and instead look like declarative reactive streams.
