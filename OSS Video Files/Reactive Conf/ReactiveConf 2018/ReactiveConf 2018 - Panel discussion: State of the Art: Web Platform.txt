00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,400
let's get started

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:20,529
so then the topic of this panel is to

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,660
talk about the state of the art of the

00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:26,710
web platform so of course this is a

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:29,949
quite quite broad topic and we just want

00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,830
to know your opinion on what's coming or

00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,019
what are you excited about the web

00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:37,750
platform today I know that you have

00:00:35,019 --> 00:00:40,210
different backgrounds and it's all good

00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,149
we don't need to share you know the same

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,520
framework it can come from any of the

00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:49,270
popular frameworks even vanilla

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,610
JavaScript if you like that and even if

00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:54,100
you are not coming from from the web

00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:58,390
platform it will also be interesting to

00:00:54,100 --> 00:01:01,300
know your opinion which maybe it's a

00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:04,149
little bit too far but I will ask you to

00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:08,110
to give a little intro of yourselves and

00:01:04,149 --> 00:01:10,780
then what you think is the most exciting

00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:12,880
thing I mean we know we know some of

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,900
them has been around in social media for

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,060
the past few days

00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,630
so I guess we will cover most of those

00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,509
and maybe some topics that we don't know

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,229
right now so maybe we start with you

00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:30,850
smaller hi everybody I'm small at Jacobs

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:35,500
I come from Israel and I've been

00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:40,090
developing with some some programming

00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:42,070
languages before Java Python C++ and I

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,550
fell in love with the web and then

00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:48,850
it was angularjs by the time I realized

00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,870
that everything goes towards the web all

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:55,570
the applications are reaching a lot of

00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,870
users on the web and so that's why I

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:01,660
really wanted to get into this and

00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:04,780
angularjs but at that time was really

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:08,800
amazing and now I'm into angular the new

00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,110
version and developer consultant trainer

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,640
I'm the founder of venture girls where

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:19,990
we teach women to program to get into

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,580
programming with angular so yeah

00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:24,400
basically that's what I do and I really

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,959
love it and that's that's awesome I

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,820
really like NG girls I'm a big fan and I

00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:34,390
see you know all the work you're doing

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:37,780
it's it's awesome what would be one of

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,690
the topics that is catching your eye the

00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:47,170
web platform it could be also from

00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:49,269
angular well the web platform in angular

00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:53,950
is also a platform that gives you a lot

00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:56,260
of tools to enjoy the possibilities that

00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,519
you have in the web platform so if we're

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,070
talking about progressive web

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:04,110
applications if we're talking about web

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:09,400
components and everything everything

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:14,290
angular really gives you a lot of a lot

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:20,380
of ways integrated to help you use these

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:23,830
new technologies so do I have to say

00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,110
something that's not specific no no you

00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,330
can you can you can talk about angular

00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,010
doesn't progressive web applications is

00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,890
something that I'm really excited about

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,830
and I've been giving talks about it also

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:38,830
so I think that's that's a really great

00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,989
thing cool yeah it really is

00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,750
I mean progressive web apps has been

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:46,180
around for a couple of years but there's

00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,940
you know browsers are adopting some of

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:51,510
the core technologies and it's now

00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,660
I would say you know ready ready to go

00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:58,630
yeah yeah ready it's almost you know

00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,330
browsers but really getting there really

00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:05,140
fast and we see a lot of potential there

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:07,690
cool so it's let's introduce our next

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,510
panelist if you can just give a brief

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:13,390
intro and then some of the topics that

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,940
excite you about what's coming sure

00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,519
my name is David Khurshid I live in

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:21,660
Orlando Florida where it's a lot warmer

00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,880
than over here I work at Microsoft and

00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,340
we we do a little bit of everything we

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,040
work with different companies just doing

00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:32,880
solutions with Azure with them so we'll

00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,980
work on you know Python Scala's c-sharp

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,350
JavaScript typescript a lot just a whole

00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,030
bunch of different things and but some

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,100
of the things that interests me I'm sure

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:46,390
you know our reactive animations of

00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:48,040
course and software modeling so using

00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:50,590
state machines and state charts which I

00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,720
gave a talk on yesterday yeah I'm

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,480
actually impressed what you can achieve

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,340
with these state machines yeah and I'm

00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,970
following I'm also following your work

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,930
on that on that topic and also reactive

00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:03,190
animations really really cool stuff

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,400
mm-hmm

00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:09,940
yeah and so what excites me about that

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,130
is that I was telling him that the

00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,710
future of you know the web platform

00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:17,350
stuff is sort of going back to the past

00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:19,720
in my view where we're rediscovering old

00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:22,210
patterns that hadn't proven time and

00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,360
time again in other industries to work

00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:28,750
really well and we're adapting them for

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,460
our own needs in the web such as you

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:35,800
know reactive animations it's a very old

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,840
paper 1997 statecharts 1987 and even now

00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,419
we're all hyped about react hooks if

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:43,540
you're using react that's sort of

00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:46,360
algebraic effects you know which are

00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,820
pretty old so yeah it's a it's a nice

00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,010
it's nice to see you know some of these

00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:53,890
concepts being applied today and they

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:57,070
are you know solid on you know academy

00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:59,689
and you know they are now coming to the

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:03,110
web platform is it good news right

00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:07,989
yes so thank thanks for the for your

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:10,789
intro David we'll move to our next

00:06:07,989 --> 00:06:12,649
panelist you want to introduce yourself

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,110
and then pick pick some of the things

00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:17,479
that you are excited about okay hi I'm

00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:19,039
David David Koch well I work at

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,709
blueberry here in Prague and we are

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,059
digital agency and we are working with

00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:25,519
cutting edge technologies for our

00:06:23,059 --> 00:06:27,679
customers in our internal projects so we

00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:30,139
are using react for example view or

00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:32,419
reason in our internal project so a

00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:35,179
interesting job and we are pretty

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:37,129
excited about reason as we are also as a

00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:41,149
community we are organizing reason ml

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:43,489
community in a prac and basically I'm

00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,860
not I don't have a computer science

00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:47,479
degree because I was a lawyer but then I

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,909
got bored I went to code and became

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,979
developer so I've been programming for

00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:53,899
more than two years so my background is

00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:55,339
a little bit different then a you to I

00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,719
don't have that much experience in

00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:59,299
different programming languages because

00:06:56,719 --> 00:07:02,209
I always program only in JavaScript and

00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:04,579
now move to reason ok so that I guess

00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:05,469
it's to my background that's that's

00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:09,860
awesome

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:11,479
Thanks and now your question yeah so

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:13,669
some some of the things that you know

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,099
are under your rather that you are like

00:07:13,669 --> 00:07:19,719
following up and maybe you get you know

00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:22,069
some excitement from them who PD's

00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:25,519
myself I would like react as a framework

00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,169
but still I think that in general a

00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,819
JavaScript development is kind of hard

00:07:27,169 --> 00:07:30,259
because you have so many choices how to

00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,239
create your applications you have so

00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:34,849
many frameworks for example what I

00:07:32,239 --> 00:07:36,439
mentioned in my yesterday's talk is that

00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:38,719
basically when you want to build some

00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,729
scalable react application you only you

00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:42,199
need to use a lot of dependencies you

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,360
know in JavaScript because it was

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,849
evolving quite slowly there are so many

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,829
features and many developers are used to

00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:52,069
build JavaScript applications

00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:54,409
differently so basically they are it's

00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:55,969
really difficult to like to find

00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:58,369
consensus between different developers

00:07:55,969 --> 00:08:00,529
because they are used two different ways

00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:03,279
to write code that's what I for example

00:08:00,529 --> 00:08:05,569
like reason because in reason basically

00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,249
basically a major language and there are

00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:10,909
not so many ways how you can build these

00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:12,360
applications so in general if like if we

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:14,189
can talk like recent is the

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,229
future somehow so what I like about

00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:18,629
reason is that you don't need so many

00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,610
dependencies and there are really not so

00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,520
many ways how to write reason code so

00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:25,469
there are less choices so in general for

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,219
company's development reason for me

00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:30,870
would be like easier in a way that you

00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:32,640
have some standard way how to write your

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:35,640
code this right thing is a power of

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,399
reason and another another thing while

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,800
like reason is its compilation targets

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,670
basically okay mo you can compile it to

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,700
bytecode you can compile web assembly so

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,769
you can build theoretically a single app

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:54,269
in reason and compile it to Mac OS echo

00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:55,829
Mac OS iOS Android browser and desktop

00:08:54,269 --> 00:08:58,370
so I think this is the really powerful

00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:00,510
feature of okay mo no reason and

00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,390
basically we are waiting for somebody to

00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,850
create like react in reason that we can

00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:07,470
compile to all these platforms that it

00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,720
will be real powerful it will really

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,920
mean one code and all of the platforms

00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:16,949
so it's wild like reason and for example

00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:19,050
a two weeks ago I've seen a talk by one

00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:21,240
Deverell from Mozilla and he was talking

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:24,329
how they are using rust and they were

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,940
showing on benchmarks and basically they

00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:30,899
I think they recreated dev tools in rust

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:33,060
and it was so much faster than in

00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,949
JavaScript and they basically they work

00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,990
with what assembly as well so I think

00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:38,940
the future is just you may be compiling

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,769
to web assembly or two different sources

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,140
I think there are so many possible

00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:44,850
futures for web development Oh totally

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,550
totally there's a lot of things going on

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,519
and but it's good to to have you know

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,750
different people talking about what

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,029
excites them because they can show

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,010
something that we ignore right now

00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:59,220
because we are kind of in one community

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,470
or we are using one framework so this is

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:03,269
excellent just having you know your your

00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,550
input on that Thanks

00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:11,300
so the next let's go for the next

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:15,360
panelist you want to give us a small

00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:17,459
okay that was quick but and then if you

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,400
can pick like few topics that excites

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,100
you right now

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:25,470
I'm from all Dover but I live in Boston

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,600
I work for a company called Cypress a oh

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,000
we're doing end-to-end testing of web

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,420
apps and the thing that really excites

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:38,640
me is that the browser's are now pretty

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:41,790
at the same level Microsoft decided they

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,250
want to catch up right to Chrome so they

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:48,330
actually the edge now supports pretty

00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:52,830
much the same Chrome Firefox is the same

00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:55,170
and Safari is lagging but if you think

00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,300
about like how you used to program what

00:10:55,170 --> 00:11:13,860
baseline was so far removed from the

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:17,100
cutting edge here yeah we have been so

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,470
much time you know with many browsers

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,680
like coming behind and then catching up

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,980
a little bit too late and then having to

00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:29,010
you know patch our our code or how we do

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,290
things just to accommodate these these

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:34,650
browsers I mean this is probably a

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,470
historic moment when we get like all of

00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:38,850
the browser's kind of aligned and

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:41,910
adopting technologies like progressive

00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:44,610
web apps and all of these shiny features

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:46,470
in that you can access from any any of

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:53,400
the different options that's that's

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:57,240
exciting I don't agree I don't agree I

00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:58,100
totally agree with you thanks thanks a

00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,520
lot

00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:05,279
let's go with the final final panelist

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:08,160
just at the at the corner everybody my

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,140
name is Ryan shank II Canada and

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,490
something that well I should give you a

00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,529
little background but Consultants I do

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:15,330
work with angular and node quite often

00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,550
and some other technologies as well but

00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:18,779
mainly angular and node and one of the

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,150
things that I really like about the web

00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,380
platform as its evolving today is things

00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:24,510
are getting easier I think in general

00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,760
like you know we might all agree that

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:28,620
many pieces that we used to have to do

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,630
we're tricky and difficult it took a lot

00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,340
of time they are getting easier there's

00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,470
still a lot of things that are hard to

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,120
do and what I like that I'm seeing these

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,950
days is there's more and more companies

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,900
and services that are popping up to

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:41,820
solve those hard problems so whether

00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,380
it's Cyprus with end-to-end testing or

00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,690
the company that I used to work for off

00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,610
zero which helps to solve authentication

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:49,620
we're seeing I think we're seeing more

00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,140
companies that are saw solving the

00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,360
problems that are still hard and doing

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,860
it in a really elegant way and so what's

00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,930
really nice about that is that people

00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,420
who maybe are coming from different

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,130
backgrounds like law for example and

00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:04,140
maybe are just new to coding they don't

00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:05,940
have to spend years trying to figure out

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,200
stuff like a woth they can just plug

00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,810
into a service they don't really have to

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,400
care about exactly how old works they

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,980
don't have to read the spec and spend

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,140
time on things that aren't ultimately

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,610
patek value to their application rather

00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,510
they can just plug into a service so I

00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:20,880
think we're seeing more and more of

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:23,040
these these kinds of services which is

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,440
super helpful the other thing that I

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,420
really like personally this might not be

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,300
everybody's opinion but I think we're

00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,790
starting to see a lot of settling in

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,700
terms of new technologies and the hype

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,380
so you know three or four years ago it

00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,480
was like new JavaScript frameworks every

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:41,400
week and some people still would contend

00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:43,140
that that's happening but I I'm starting

00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,850
to see things settling a bit you know if

00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,600
you think about the bigger players like

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,280
react angular and UJS and you know

00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,320
there's some other libraries in there as

00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,490
well and that's not to say that there

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,740
shouldn't be innovation there shouldn't

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,700
be you know more technology kind of

00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,460
coming out there shouldn't be people

00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,760
trying to do more but I think a lot of

00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:04,530
the tension that we typically see around

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,090
javascript frameworks in particular I

00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,440
think that's starting to settle there I

00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,170
think that's a good thing I think you

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,940
know if we can if we can learn the tools

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:13,830
that have been established and become

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,660
really affect effective with them I

00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:17,190
think developers are gonna be much more

00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:20,010
productive rather than fighting about

00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,820
what's the you don't best new hype so

00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:24,140
those are the things that I'm excited

00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:26,520
about also really good really good

00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:30,060
conversation we're having here what I

00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:31,970
what I want to mention is a topic that

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,090
it's very close to my heart

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:38,930
it's the community so how do you see

00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:41,960
what's the role of the community in in

00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:45,050
the web and web technologies and how we

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,090
can bring you know improvements to the

00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:50,330
way we are we are dealing with community

00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:52,670
maybe some of the activities that you

00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:54,800
are doing or some activities that we

00:14:52,670 --> 00:15:04,790
could do to improve that situation

00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:06,230
who wants who wants to start I got a lot

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,940
of ideas in mind on how the community

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,300
can help and how we can help the

00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,860
community so first of all if you have a

00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,630
community of developers and you're in

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:20,740
touch with them then you you can learn

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:24,470
from their experience you can hear about

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:27,980
what their problems are the difficulty

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:32,450
is of course you get bug reports you get

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:35,540
PRS and the angular team actually makes

00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,870
a lot of use of the community they're in

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,690
touch with the community leaders and

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:44,060
occasionally they asked us to bring

00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:47,000
feedback that we hear from the community

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:51,980
from users from meetups

00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:54,170
and so on and so and then they get ideas

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:56,060
that they haven't thought about by

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,640
themselves because you really need to

00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:02,600
look around you in other projects other

00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:07,250
companies other people to realize new

00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:10,160
things and so so that's a really great

00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:13,010
advancement there and it doesn't only

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,020
help a projects like antler it helps the

00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:18,590
web itself because the community comes

00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:22,520
with its demands and then the web

00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:25,960
platform is it's getting there according

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,370
to these demands so all the

00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:31,550
standards that we have with the ACMA

00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:36,530
script that you can suggest your

00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:39,470
standards your vote for it that's that's

00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:42,350
why asked by all of you

00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:46,730
you want a feature you believe in

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:49,010
something then you can really make a

00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:52,250
difference yeah that's that's really

00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:55,250
that's really important getting all this

00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:57,440
feedback and also figuring out things

00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:59,360
that maybe you didn't you didn't thought

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,050
before when you were building a library

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,550
or you're building some some service and

00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:07,760
any of the other panelists you have any

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:10,070
stories about things that happen during

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,580
a community event or something that you

00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:18,140
remember that was eye-opening or that

00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:21,709
you you want to share with us well I run

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:25,250
the Orlando code pen community and if

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:26,900
you all use code pen it's a very very

00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,360
social it's sort of like a social

00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,850
network for experimental coding on the

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,410
web which is great because we get a

00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,300
variety of people who come to the meetup

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:38,300
from all different levels whether it's

00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,820
junior or senior developers and also

00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,920
just a diverse range of people too and

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,470
so it's really interesting junior

00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,030
developers we've seen who come to these

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:48,830
meetups they're the ones who are

00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,420
experimenting the most they're trying

00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:52,520
the new technologies they're trying to

00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,680
see what they can make with that and so

00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,480
whether you're starting out or you're

00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,400
more experienced just going to those

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,010
meetups and supporting people like that

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,960
is going to be really really beneficial

00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,910
to them because those are the people who

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,640
one day are gonna you know come up to

00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:09,760
this stage and give inspirational talks

00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:13,550
and you know so you want to support that

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,160
yeah actually I I also follow the code

00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:18,530
pen community actually there is a way

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,750
that you can run if you are if you are

00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:24,320
interested and this is more around

00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:26,510
creative coding and usually they they go

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,120
on stage which is something mind-blowing

00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:31,370
they go on stage and try some technique

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,840
which can involve you know

00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:38,420
SBG or some fancy technology mostly

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,150
bezel and then you will be like oh wow

00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:44,090
what is that and it's kind of really

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:45,770
difficult to get that knowledge in any

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,010
other place because it's kind of

00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:52,400
experimental and it's it has this wall

00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:54,020
factor which I which I like as well so

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,970
I've been thinking about something who

00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:57,680
who here would say that they're in a

00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,180
community whether it be around a

00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,240
framework or a language or whatever

00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:05,150
who's in a community okay so not very

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,130
many people who here gets their news

00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,920
about programming stuff from Twitter

00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:12,080
kind of the de facto place to go a few

00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,070
of us so not very many of us and I've

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,990
been talking with people about this

00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,280
recently I think there's this at least

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,580
amongst a lot of programmers there's

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,440
this sense that the whole JavaScript

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,000
JavaScript community if you will is on

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,010
Twitter and you can go there and you can

00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,330
learn everything you would want about

00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:28,429
JavaScript but you know for every

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:31,130
developer that's on Twitter talking

00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:33,410
about JavaScript or related really the

00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:35,390
topics probably a thousand or 10,000

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,610
more out there that never touch Twitter

00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:38,750
and they don't want to read news on

00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:40,640
Twitter they don't want to share about

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,650
their thoughts but they have opinions

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,800
they have strong feelings about

00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:53,179
languages but they don't they're not in

00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:54,410
a forum like Twitter to do so so not and

00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:56,300
I'm not saying everybody does this but

00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,410
there's this tendency to look to Twitter

00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,650
and the people who are talking about

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,540
things there as like kind of this the

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:04,640
source of truth right for what's going

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,990
on in every community I think the more

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,330
that we can kind of get out into the

00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:09,920
wild to meetups to even like if you've

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,080
got the chance to go in and talk with

00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:14,059
people in various companies over like

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,700
brown-bag lunches or whatever I think

00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:18,620
that that's probably gonna become a more

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,420
important way to start to get a sense of

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,370
what everybody really you know feels in

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:24,170
the world of oats about these these

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:27,410
topics rather than just being sucked

00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,670
right into the Twitter vortex so just

00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,410
some thoughts I've been at recently oh

00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:33,290
yeah you're completely right you're

00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:35,130
completely right so I have an example of

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:37,740
good community

00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:40,530
so everyone kind of says javascript is

00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,870
vestroia language no respect Rhys de

00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:47,240
Rana JavaScript but if you look at the

00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:50,309
JavaScript like four years ago right es6

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:54,630
every year repair proposals

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:57,000
you know critique adoption stages right

00:20:54,630 --> 00:21:00,360
so every anyone can propose something

00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,669
new for JavaScript publicly you got on

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:05,870
github look up at my script tc39

00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:08,820
comedian they have a github repo

00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,650
well-organized labeled and you can just

00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,320
say I want Java Script to have this

00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:15,240
operator or have this feature anyone can

00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:17,610
do it and then like it goes through

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,590
stages and maybe it will reach Stage

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,289
four and all become part of a language

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:24,720
right every year and this is what the

00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:26,730
best most transparent process where

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,740
community can actually steer the

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,289
language in a direction where people

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,220
wanted to be as opposed to I'd know

00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:35,909
react hooks but just or cooks hear you

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,070
yeah that's right

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:40,409
I think I mean because I'm closer to the

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,549
angular community we have seen few

00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:46,559
examples of that so they they proposed

00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:48,450
observables some kind of standard

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,110
implementation to go into the standard

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:54,750
and and that's interesting to see more

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,330
of these proposals you know succeed and

00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:01,200
kind of shape you know the future of

00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:05,039
JavaScript and how we use it I want to

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,190
mention another area before we we end

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:10,169
with a little wrap-up from Europe so

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:12,179
what you are thinking about what you

00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:15,360
want to say for the wrap up I want to

00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:17,210
mention how much effort we are putting

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,460
in improving the developer experience

00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:23,730
like getting better tooling and what is

00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,650
your experience what tooling maybe some

00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:28,590
of the people here want to know about

00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,770
and that can improve their developer

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:36,169
experience as you know as how is your

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:36,169
workflow and how you can improve that

00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:43,810
Thanks for me for example the biggest

00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:45,760
like thing I know like about JavaScript

00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:47,320
reason is type system I mean if used

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,050
types in your applications

00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,550
I mean you prevent so many errors I mean

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,590
for example the beauty of the typed

00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:56,110
language with built-in type system is

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,810
that you have large application you

00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:01,150
change one thing and in JavaScript we

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:03,340
need to you need to run the app and see

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,830
like after seven clicks what's wrong but

00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:07,780
if you have a for example language of

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:09,430
types as reason you just changed

00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,410
something and a compiler will tell you

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,720
all the 20 errors you have in your app

00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,700
you will fix them you know where to fix

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,650
them and then your app will run and you

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,290
have this kind of safety setting this is

00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:23,350
like really huge change to JavaScript

00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:26,020
world to use types because it really you

00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,850
basically get rid off of the whole bunch

00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:31,270
of errors because they will be catch

00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:33,430
during during the compile time and I

00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:35,560
think this is the like for large

00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:38,050
application this is like this can save

00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,370
you a lot of time when when developing

00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,740
so I guess this is the thing I will

00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,510
laugh about present flow and typescript

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,820
and about reason that you have the type

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,520
system which is advantage in reason is

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,890
its built-in so basically you can rely

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,960
on it 100% which type script would flow

00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:55,210
they are great but sometimes when I'm

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,150
using flow I'm not sure if it's my

00:23:55,210 --> 00:24:00,520
mistake or mistake of the library so

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:02,650
that's sometimes confusing so it's just

00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,080
I want to point out that taps are really

00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,150
cool yeah totally true and we have seen

00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:09,280
I mean in angular we are using

00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:11,830
typescript since maybe two or three

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,620
years ago and we are very familiar with

00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:16,900
you know the benefits of using a type

00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,520
system and but we have seen

00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:21,880
announcements like real excitement

00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:24,220
announcements from Avenue next version

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:27,520
of you will be supporting or built using

00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:29,770
typescript there's also other efforts

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,980
like interest from the react community

00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:35,350
as well with different approaches but I

00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:37,810
would say that definitely you know types

00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:40,600
will be in the future in some shape or

00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,210
another if I may add about with an ml

00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,830
I've got to hear a little bit about it

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:46,240
and it is it does seem exciting if

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,740
you're if you want to learn something

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:52,720
new I heard that it's kind of like the

00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:54,970
wave react was supposed to be built so

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,820
now there they can there

00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,799
doing it with this new language and you

00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,030
can compile it to different things to

00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:06,580
JavaScript and to any other thing and

00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:11,760
there are tomorrow workshops say given

00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:15,309
by contributors of reason email and so

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:17,799
you very welcome to come I think it's

00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:20,679
really exciting so yeah I know I'm an

00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:22,750
angular person but hey I think there's

00:25:20,679 --> 00:25:25,210
there are exciting things also around it

00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:29,049
there also angular workshops right right

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:32,200
okay so one quick thing not mentioned

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:34,350
like I could tell you for 99% certainty

00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:36,970
the future of developer tooling is

00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,950
visual and I say that because you've

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,260
seen the popularity of framer X I'm sure

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:43,210
many of you have heard of framer X and

00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,250
there's just all sorts of tooling that

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:48,039
are just based around visually

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:49,390
developing along with code and that

00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:51,610
helps a lot because if you think about

00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,830
code you could write the most complex

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:56,740
most structured architected code you

00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:59,590
make one typo and your entire program is

00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:03,039
bust and of course we have tools that

00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:04,570
help us prevent those typos but it's

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,150
sort of silly those are just band-aids

00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:09,610
right so I think the future is visual

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:12,250
tooling and being able to see what we're

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:15,789
making yeah and we have seen this same

00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:17,909
kind of trend in different platforms

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:22,120
there's more you know

00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:24,760
advances in CL eyes we also have a lot

00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,980
of investment from the core teams to

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:29,140
just improve that experience for new

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,020
developers and also more more experience

00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:35,520
so we're going to wrap up now so if you

00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:40,090
want to live like some final final quote

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:44,409
that we can tweet later on and and then

00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:46,570
we will just wrap it up before lunch I I

00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:48,220
don't have a quote necessarily but if

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,119
you want to you can follow me on Twitter

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,619
Ryan Genki there and

00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:57,039
that's been great thanks for having us

00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:57,039
now have a future is bright awesome I

00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:01,580
think there are so many great

00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:03,259
technologies now into JavaScript the

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:05,719
world and it always depends your use

00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:07,759
case and what you need so use it I think

00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:09,169
it's not that some library school you

00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,729
should be using it just to think about

00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,679
why am I using it I think this is the

00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:14,539
most important thing to see really is

00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:19,549
this the library for my use case or not

00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:21,889
I think yes for me if you if you want to

00:27:19,549 --> 00:27:24,019
know the future look into the past don't

00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:25,909
be stuck on JavaScript don't be stuck on

00:27:24,019 --> 00:27:28,639
your framework look at what others are

00:27:25,909 --> 00:27:31,099
doing I've been in the react world for a

00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:32,899
while but angular observables they're
