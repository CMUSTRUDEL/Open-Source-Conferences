Building search engine friendly web UIs with JavaScript

The Web has a unique feature - it makes information accessible and discoverable by both humans and machines. Virtually everyone using the web relies on search engines to find information and get their questions answered.

In this talk, Igor covered real-world strategies and tips that make rich JavaScript web applications and the information they provide accessible to search engines.
