Reactive iOS App Development

Apple offers the KVO (Key-Value-Observation) framework as a way to make apps reactive to model property changes, but this technology is far from comprehensive enough to serve all of the needs of a modern application developer. We'll discuss how using Realm for iOS gives us the benefits of a truly reactive paradigm in mobile development and allows us to decouple our application logic from our API layer, creating a much cleaner application architecture that lends itself to more seamless on/offline experiences.
