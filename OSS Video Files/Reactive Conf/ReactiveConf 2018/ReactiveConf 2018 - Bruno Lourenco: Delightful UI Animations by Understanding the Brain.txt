Delightful UI animations by understanding the brain

Check out the world’s award-winning websites—what do they all have in common? Animations! They have elements that move and change. When done well, animations can amaze us. But why are some animations delightful while others are so annoying? The answer could be in how our brain perceives motion. Understanding this could be the key to confidently adding animations to our websites and apps. Animations with code seem hard, but they shouldn’t be. In this talk, I will give some tips and explore some tools to simplify creating animations in React.

[Music]

00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:19,160
so hi everyone thank you for the great

00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:22,460
introduction so my name is Bruno I'm a

00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:26,450
front-end developer at Ginetta and you

00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:29,420
can find me on Twitter and github so we

00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:34,039
are developers and our goal is to create

00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:37,820
amazing apps and websites and if we

00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:40,609
check out one of these sites we can find

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,539
these award-winning websites and they

00:00:40,609 --> 00:00:48,589
are great people like them but what they

00:00:44,539 --> 00:00:51,920
all have in common so all of them they

00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:55,429
have animations so they have elements

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,839
that moves change interactive components

00:00:55,429 --> 00:01:03,430
and when the animations are done well

00:00:58,839 --> 00:01:06,979
the animation can really amaze us and

00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,660
not only amazed but animations has the

00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:10,790
potential to communicate in the

00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:15,610
different level grab the user attention

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:19,970
reduce the cognitive load but why some

00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:25,640
animations are good while others are bad

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:29,360
and annoying so this question why was

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:33,020
hunting me because it's just a matter of

00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,810
how it feels is this the only accurate

00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,780
measure tool that we have so it's like

00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:42,980
yeah I like this animation no that's

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:46,970
annoying so I want to know why so I

00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:50,390
decided to do some research and I found

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:54,920
this website Google material more

00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:57,050
specifically the material motion and if

00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:00,430
you don't know this website check it out

00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:04,580
is super cool you will find nice guides

00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:08,840
explanations it's super cool but once

00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:11,180
again I found this here so in Google

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,340
material we can find animations like

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:17,180
this one and this looks like ok but

00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:21,409
actually No

00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,040
we shouldn't do that why then there you

00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:26,959
will find just a small sentence

00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,170
explaining why but I want to know more

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,319
and then we can find another example

00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:36,590
like this one it's a little bit more

00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:38,780
complex a lot of things going on but in

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:43,220
this case it's a do we should do that

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:45,920
but again why and we can just find a

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,909
small paragraph explaining but I want to

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,849
know more so I decided to go deeper and

00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:55,670
starts with the basics with this

00:02:52,849 --> 00:03:00,170
question so what is animation after all

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:03,049
and by the definition animation is the

00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:05,389
technique of producing the illusion of

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:08,720
movements by displaying a series of

00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:11,090
images or frames so we can simplify this

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,730
a little bit more so animation is the

00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:20,239
illusion of movement so animation it's

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:23,930
just an illusion and for me this was

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,599
like an aha moment because since it's

00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:28,849
just an illusion it doesn't matter the

00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:32,209
technique if you are using react view

00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:34,519
angular or animating with CSS a div

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,849
towards BAM canvas it doesn't matter

00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:42,889
what the goal our goal is just to create

00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:46,609
great illusions and one illusion by

00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:49,790
definition is the wrong perception of a

00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:52,970
sensory experience so we need to create

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:57,799
this wrong perception so we need to fool

00:03:52,970 --> 00:04:02,359
one organ of our body it's not the eyes

00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:05,599
but the brain because the vision has

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:08,239
more to do with the brain than with with

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,060
our eyes so in order to understand this

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,209
a little bit more it is true that our

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,169
eyes captures the lights but this

00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:20,510
information and we can see in this image

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:23,930
the eyes captured this information and

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:27,380
sent to the back of our brain to the

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:30,560
visual cortex and just to have a little

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,230
idea the work involved here there is

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,110
more than

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,290
30 different zones just to analyze and

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:40,440
process the image for example we have a

00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:42,780
specific area just to see the contour or

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,920
the shape of the objects we have a

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:50,100
different area just to see in colors and

00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:54,570
we have one dedicated area for guess

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,940
what animations so can you point which

00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,150
area is this

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:02,310
so is this little guy over the over

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,820
there it is called empty

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:10,650
that stands for with a middle temporal

00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:13,380
or also known as V 5 V 5 so this is

00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:16,440
where all the fun is so in order to

00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:20,910
create these great illusions we need to

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,640
fool the MT so here is where we need to

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:27,900
look to create these amazing animations

00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,760
but how this area works just a

00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:32,430
disclaimer here I'm another scientist

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:34,590
but I did some research and I found

00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:38,820
quite interesting and I want to share

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:43,440
with you so if you take a look on this

00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,960
example this is what empty sees so there

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:50,130
is no color just black and white and

00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:54,360
each of these dots represents one neuron

00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:57,540
from our brain so this is like an static

00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:02,430
image but what happens if something

00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,740
passes through our eyes so I I will

00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,220
click here so will happen something like

00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,560
this the neuron will fire and if

00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,340
something is moving the neighbor will

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,950
fire and this is just and we need to

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,060
remember that this is just individual

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:25,260
neurons individual information but in

00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:27,920
order to see motion the brain the MT

00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:32,910
needs to performs a lot of calculations

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:35,700
so it's something like this so what our

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:38,190
brain needs to do is to calculate based

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,890
on the position of each neuron and the

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:44,370
time passed needs to calculate the

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,280
direction and the speed of the motion so

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:47,440
it's

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,010
thing like this it will create like a

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,889
vector a vector field so when it's very

00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:56,560
slow the vector is small when the motion

00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:59,760
is faster it will create like a faster

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,560
motion and our brain is doing this for

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:05,820
everything that moves in front of us

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,180
so our GPU is working all the time

00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:12,280
performing all these calculations and do

00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,160
you want to see how important these

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,520
calculations are so I want to do with

00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,330
you

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:22,840
one small experiment so I want you to

00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:26,470
hold your head still like this and try

00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,570
to move your eyes from left to right but

00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:32,590
without moving your head and try to move

00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:35,380
it the ice very slowly this models that

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:40,360
you can and you will notice that our

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:43,780
eyes will do like small jumps can you

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,710
notice so these small jumps it's called

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:50,650
saccades so we cannot actually do a very

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:53,530
smooth movement but now I want you to do

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:56,380
the same but hold your head and now move

00:07:53,530 --> 00:08:03,090
your finger in front of you and try to

00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:06,910
follow your finger can you see and now

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,600
it's much smoother right so what's going

00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:11,979
on here

00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:15,220
so when empty performs this calculation

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:18,490
it can predict the path and the vector

00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:22,120
and the information these calculations

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:26,200
is sent back to the eyes as motor

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,770
signals or eye movements so the

00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:31,870
information is sent back to our eyes and

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:34,780
by doing this we can follow objects very

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,940
smoothly but people that suffer some

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,780
injures in this area they lose

00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,089
disability also alcohol can affect that

00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,140
so I have another experiment to the

00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:49,839
video so later at the bar after drinking

00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,530
record your face and move your finger if

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,770
you cannot follow your fingers smoothly

00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:56,220
congratulations

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,220
you are drunk

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:07,450
so this night feature

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:09,460
it's called smooth pursuit so it's

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:12,130
called smooth pursuit and try to

00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:15,220
memorize that we'll come back later for

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:18,310
this so every time that we have on an

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,820
animation there is a vector so if there

00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:25,120
is a translation try to see this vector

00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:28,030
if there is a fade-out fading try to

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,580
visualize this in visual vectors that

00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:33,850
our brain needs to calculate so all the

00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:37,030
movements will create these vectors so

00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:39,040
the more arrows do we have the more

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:41,680
brain power is necessary to calculate

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:45,970
all these movements and less pleasant

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:49,960
the animation becomes but our brain has

00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:54,040
a way to optimize these tasks so adding

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:56,950
easing it will help but also our brain

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,990
will do something like this so let's

00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:02,020
suppose that we have two movements two

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:06,610
motions at the same time one 45 degrees

00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:11,250
up and other 45 degrees down what the

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:15,460
brain will do is will create the average

00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:17,380
between the motion and the brain is

00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:21,250
doing that all the time and we have

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:24,220
another experiment to see how can can we

00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,730
notice that so as we can see here we

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:32,740
have random particles moving different

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:35,860
directions but 20% of them are moving to

00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,910
a specific direction so can you notice

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:42,940
what is the global motion here so if you

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,550
think that this 20% of particles are

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,770
moving to the right please raise your

00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:48,760
right hand if you think they are moving

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:53,490
to the left

00:10:48,760 --> 00:11:00,430
let raise your left hand okay

00:10:53,490 --> 00:11:02,040
right left okay cool I will help you so

00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:04,930
they are moving to the right

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,170
congratulations if you said left you are

00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,170
drunk

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:16,490
okay so this ability to calculate the

00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:20,029
average it's called global motion

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:23,510
perception and how can we apply that in

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:26,450
our animations so we have a here another

00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,210
example from Google material and they

00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,180
say that we need to do this it's a nice

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:37,730
animation like a staggering but we

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:40,210
should avoid this one why now we know

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:44,390
better so because in the first example

00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:47,020
there is just one smooth vector it's

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:51,589
very easy to notice the global motion

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:54,950
while here even though the it's in the

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:58,279
same direction because of the delay we

00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,470
can notice like multiple tiny vectors so

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:04,040
we should always aim to connect them to

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:07,610
create just one smooth animation also

00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,940
now we have this one and we can know why

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,010
this is bad because the all the

00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,470
directions that they are moving we

00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,230
cannot say what is the global motion

00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:21,800
here we can clearly tell what's going on

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:25,280
and then we have this example here again

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:28,430
and so how can we understand this

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:35,170
example so in order to understand we

00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:35,170
have here another experiment so here

00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:40,940
okay so here we have particles but in

00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,270
this case we don't have a global motion

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,480
we they are just random particles but I

00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:51,470
will add something here so I want you to

00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:54,820
follow the red dot and you will notice

00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:58,520
that while we are following the red dot

00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:02,779
suddenly the background movement seems

00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:05,870
to stop and when they are slowing down

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:10,660
we start seeing the movement again can

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:13,900
you see it so when we follow the

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:18,589
background movement seems to stop right

00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,450
so what's going on here well remember

00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:23,660
smooth pursuit when we are following

00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:27,710
one object so when empty engaged this

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:31,940
mood pursuit then the background vector

00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:34,730
calculations are turned off so how can

00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:36,560
we use that so every time that we need

00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:39,440
to create a complex animation like a

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,250
page transition we can give something to

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,430
the user to focus on so this will

00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:49,010
disable the background animations and

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,950
vectors and will become more pleasant

00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:56,270
and less cognitive power is necessary to

00:13:51,950 --> 00:14:00,680
process this image but now let's write

00:13:56,270 --> 00:14:04,700
something different so let's suppose in

00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,730
the brain perspective we are looking to

00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:10,700
an animation like this so in the real

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:13,520
world it's not really common that all

00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,790
the objects starts moving at the same

00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,710
time right it's not really common so in

00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,710
the brain perspective when everything is

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:25,040
moving at the same speed if it's

00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:29,870
perceived not as one object moving but

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,690
maybe we are in fact moving so this is

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:36,170
called self motion so it is perceived as

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:39,590
self motion instead of object motion how

00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:43,220
can we use this well we can create

00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:47,540
things like page transitions navigations

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:51,470
and this happens when we move a big part

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:56,270
of the screen it is super loose useful

00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:58,670
to create special navigation so the by

00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,400
doing that the user have this feeling

00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:05,990
that he is now in the different position

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,510
of the application but when we move big

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,170
parts we need to be careful because this

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:18,230
is a great power but as we know with

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:21,710
great powers games great and that's true

00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:25,250
because our animations can make people

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:28,310
sick so just by watch watching our

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:31,100
animations and there is a condition

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:33,440
called vestibular disorder that people

00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,560
with that can

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,129
if you loss of balance vertical

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:43,870
migraines nausea so this could be a real

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:47,560
problem but how can we avoid that so

00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:51,410
something that we can do is try to avoid

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,829
animating big parts of the screen adding

00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:58,819
something to focus could help also we

00:15:54,829 --> 00:16:01,759
should avoid any big rotations why

00:15:58,819 --> 00:16:05,060
because it's natural to move our heads

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:08,870
like this horizontally vertically but we

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:11,629
never do like these rotations maybe when

00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:13,339
we are in the boat but people get sick

00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:17,480
in the boat still so we should avoid

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:21,079
this kind of big rotations also long

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,660
transitions and we should keep it short

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:26,629
avoid big transitions in relation to the

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,620
viewport and also we always should give

00:16:26,629 --> 00:16:33,110
an option to reduce motions or turn off

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,839
certain animations there is a media

00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:40,639
query for that is called reduce motion

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,310
media query that we can use so can we

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,279
remember these brain features the first

00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:49,459
one that we talked about was this smooth

00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,370
pursuit so if we get something to the

00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:55,490
user to focus this will be much smoother

00:16:52,370 --> 00:17:00,740
and could give a better sense of

00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:04,069
direction also it's always good to see

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,620
in vectors so every time that we are

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:10,429
animating try to see these invisible

00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:14,709
vectors that our animations creates and

00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:18,679
try to keep it short in distance also

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:22,069
remember global motion we should try to

00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:25,069
connect these vectors and should be very

00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:29,360
clear we should know what is the global

00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:32,240
motion of my animations and we need to

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,880
use special navigation to create things

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,049
like navigation but very carefully

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:43,100
avoiding big portions of the screen

00:17:38,049 --> 00:17:46,590
so now by understanding a little bit

00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:49,500
more how the brain works we can

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:53,309
and why some animations are bad and why

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:56,610
we should avoid them and but how can we

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:59,400
create and build these animations there

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:03,000
is a lot of tools I've created these

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:06,179
this react morph to simplify the

00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,220
creation of complex morphing animations

00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,700
when we need to transform one element

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,919
into another but you can also use react

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,510
pose I recommended this one they have

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,370
like a simple API that you can use also

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:23,909
popcorn from pop motion to create

00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:27,529
vanilla animations and react spring it's

00:18:23,909 --> 00:18:30,210
also nice and if you want to know more I

00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:33,360
recommend this book from Val health it's

00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:35,039
design interface animations and in order

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,260
to understand a little bit better how

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,490
the brain works there is the work of the

00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:47,640
neurobiologist professor bill nielsen so

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:50,279
now what so let's animate more so do

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,730
more experiments share your knowledge

00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:56,940
try new tools communicate with your team

00:18:53,730 --> 00:19:00,179
with the designers and because after

00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:03,419
understanding the why we can be more

00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:06,600
confident and people like animations so

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:11,410
please add more animations to create

00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:18,709
amazing apps and websites thank you

00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:21,419
[Applause]

00:19:18,709 --> 00:19:22,739
great talk feel like there's gonna be a

00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:25,409
lot of people later tonight with their

00:19:22,739 --> 00:19:28,289
phones giving the thumbs-up completely

00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:29,939
drunk all right let's have a look at

00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:32,149
some of the questions what is your

00:19:29,939 --> 00:19:35,969
favorite tool for prototyping animations

00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:39,719
yes like I said I really like pop motion

00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:41,879
pose they have a super easy API that you

00:19:39,719 --> 00:19:44,429
can use very declarative you can use

00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:46,349
define the one state and the other and

00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,139
then you can toggle between just

00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:52,349
changing the state so it's super cool

00:19:49,139 --> 00:19:55,439
great next one how the fade ins and outs

00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:57,569
translate into vectors exactly so the

00:19:55,439 --> 00:20:02,009
thing is that even though when there is

00:19:57,569 --> 00:20:05,369
no a transition a real object moving if

00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:07,979
we do like fade out here a fading here

00:20:05,369 --> 00:20:09,959
there will be this sense that something

00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:11,219
is moving from here from that direction

00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:14,269
to that direction

00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:17,579
so it always will create that so if we

00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:21,089
fade out here fading here then here will

00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:23,969
can automatically see like a vector

00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:27,239
going this direction so it's always good

00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:29,069
to try to focus and try to use that in a

00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:31,529
functional way so if you want to grab a

00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:34,289
tension for for one specific direction

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:36,329
then we should use this vector in our

00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,719
favor all right

00:20:36,329 --> 00:20:42,889
next one for me what do you think about

00:20:39,719 --> 00:20:45,809
reactive jeaious background animation

00:20:42,889 --> 00:20:47,639
okay yeah that's a good one so we were

00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,219
talking about the one that appears in

00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:53,459
there definitely asking the wrong person

00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:56,749
yeah I don't think your active J yes I

00:20:53,459 --> 00:20:58,709
don't know I don't know what it's about

00:20:56,749 --> 00:21:00,119
you'll have to find him in the break

00:20:58,709 --> 00:21:01,889
we'll move on to the next one from John

00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,109
what do you think about using animations

00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:06,599
and website accessibility for users with

00:21:04,109 --> 00:21:10,409
eye defects do you have some tips and

00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:12,539
tricks yeah so like I said there is this

00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:16,859
condition first people are disorder that

00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:20,249
we should avoid big transitions also

00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:24,059
animation that starts automatically for

00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:28,229
more than 5 seconds and we should give

00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:32,150
options to disable them but people with

00:21:28,229 --> 00:21:37,490
eye defects so if you are blind Danny

00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:40,160
it makes no sense right but animation

00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:42,980
itself cannot remove the accessibility

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,860
so if you create like a good mark up

00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:49,190
with good accessibility then you are

00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:52,510
covered basically alright your opinion

00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:57,230
about flip animations so it's awesome

00:21:52,510 --> 00:22:00,980
react morph and it's using that so it's

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,840
a good way to keep your code simple in

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,360
the way in this case with react morph

00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:08,870
I'm just using two states one state that

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,150
we can declare it easily and then the

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,770
other state and all the transition in

00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:15,890
between is just elements that are

00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:17,240
created and doing this flip animation so

00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:18,980
if you don't know how this works

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,610
basically we need to calculate the

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:25,220
target position and then we animate from

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,930
the initial position to the target so

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:31,250
it's super cool if you don't know please

00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:32,930
check it out mm-hmm all right if the

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,060
device is not powerful enough to do

00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:39,020
smooth animations is it better to turn

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:42,890
them off yes because once again because

00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:45,920
of the brain because our brain will try

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:48,680
to always see things like we see in the

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,340
real world so we should always aim to

00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:54,950
have a good frame rate there is some

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,500
techniques you can control like the

00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:59,420
frame rate and if you can reduce let's

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,370
say the complexity like reducing

00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:07,520
particles or big elements then we can

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:11,740
use that in our favor but if the frame

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,720
rate isn't good so we should avoid it

00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:18,130
all right next one can usage of pastel

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:20,570
colors help to make better transitions

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:25,190
that's the interesting one I never

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:28,220
thought about that yeah I don't know how

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:32,090
this could work in terms of how can we

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,620
perceive food for thought alright maybe

00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,120
time for one or two more questions how

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,140
did you learn all this animation

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,810
knowledge yeah I searched the web and

00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:43,130
there is very good resources there is

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:45,830
some sites that you can search for

00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,070
papers online you can search you

00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:52,000
to videos and there is some examples

00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:55,880
that's similar to the ones that I show

00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,669
but they use like some videos or gifs

00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:02,350
and all these examples that I did was

00:23:58,669 --> 00:24:04,820
with points jeaious to be interactable

00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:07,519
but there's a lot of resource online

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,710
that if you are interested in enough you

00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:12,140
can search and you'll find some very

00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:13,549
good good stuff fantastic Thank You

00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,680
Bruno let's go give a round of applause

00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:17,890
thank you

00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,890
