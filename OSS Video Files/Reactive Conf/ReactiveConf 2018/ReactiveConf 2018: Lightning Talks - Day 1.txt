Do we need types in JavaScript?
In this talk, I want to share my experience gained during the development of frontend applications in several programming languages. I think it's not a secret for anybody that developing large JavaScript applications is not so easy as it seems at first glance. We all want something simpler and more reliable. Therefore, many developers and even entire companies switch to different, compiled in JavaScript, programming languages. The bulk of such transitions is accounted for TypeScript and flow, and often, developers faced with more problems than they were before. I wasn't the exception. Moving to a new project, I started using TypeScript and was disappointed. Luckily in my next project I used ClojureScript and it was like everything is illuminated! Since then, I know exactly what the recipe for simple and reliable code (even in plain old JavaScript). And I want to share this recipe with you.

Write better React
Do you want to write better React? In that case, you shouldnâ€™t use it with JavaScript. Why? Because JavaScript isn't compatible with React's core principles, meaning you need to mimic them using many external libraries. Fortunately, Reason is here and ready to help you out through writing safer and cleaner React code.

3. Speaker: Jakub Svehla
Avoid runtime errors with 0 lines of tests & types.
I'll show you how to not to waste your time with resolving runtime errors. Our company has only 2.5 developers so we have literally no time for writing tests or types (yeee... it's still boring). We will use the most modern bleeding edge Javascript stack based on graphQL & relay modern & flowtype for solving this pain. And don't be scared, everything is production ready and we are using it.
