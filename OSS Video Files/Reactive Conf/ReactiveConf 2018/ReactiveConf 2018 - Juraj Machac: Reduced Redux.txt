Reduced redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps. It helps to achieve consistency by keeping data in a single state, and managing state changes via dispatching actions. The idea itself is great, yet often misunderstood - the necessary code management is interpreted as a boilerplate, and coders seek any library which just helps them write a little less code. Though, most of the libraries/approaches which try to reduce this ‘boilerplate’ seem to miss the point. In this talk, we’ll discuss an approach that introduces some tradeoff, but preserves many of the important guarantees of redux, and also introduces some new nice features with less code. We’ll also talk about how to gradually transition from traditional Redux to this Reduced redux.
