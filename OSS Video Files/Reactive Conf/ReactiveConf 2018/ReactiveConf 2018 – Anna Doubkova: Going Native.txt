Going Native

React Native allows you to re-use your web code to build native applications. What’s not to like? This approach is simple in theory but challenging in practice. In this talk, you’ll learn what is re-usable and what isn’t, the intricacies of shared code bases, and cross-team communication when building React and React Native apps at the same time. With real-life examples, code snippets, and memes, you will learn everything you need to know to get started on your native journey.
