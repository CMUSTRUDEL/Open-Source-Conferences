[Music]

00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:17,320
good afternoon everyone and welcome to

00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,279
this last session that we are going to

00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,900
have in this beautiful conference we are

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,100
going to be doing with the next hour or

00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,740
so

00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,700
story a little bit of storytelling it's

00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:34,090
personal stories inspirational talks

00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:35,410
asking some questions to our guests here

00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,110
that you already know from the

00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:40,360
conference probably if you want to say

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:45,820
something introduce or whatever I don't

00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,940
think it's necessary right now we are

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,039
going to be asking some questions but

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,440
it's super important I think that you

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,019
ask your own questions because this is

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,859
actually for all of you so you're gonna

00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:01,960
have an open slide oh there we did doing

00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,960
the previous day's in the conference so

00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:09,820
you can ask and throw some questions for

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,890
them so I'm gonna start with the first

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:17,229
question I think it's going to be for

00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:19,630
mark and open source personally gave it

00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:22,060
a lot to me in me in my career I'm

00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:26,170
pretty sure if any of you is in open

00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,299
source to felt what it is like to be

00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:31,030
part of the community and contribute to

00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:36,210
something bigger and I want to ask mark

00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:39,820
that I know he is a very active

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:42,399
contributor to open source how did he

00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:49,360
got in the first place for the first

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:53,049
time in open source general and for me

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,950
it was it's quite a while ago now I've

00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:58,149
been doing jobs here for a long time and

00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,829
what really got me into open source was

00:01:58,149 --> 00:02:02,500
actually like jQuery and the plug-in

00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:05,469
community around that and my first open

00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:08,350
source project was a jQuery plug-in that

00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:11,110
I wrote for doing presentations in the

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,430
browser obviously that's very standard

00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,540
now but back then it was pretty it was

00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:20,560
pretty rare and I used it up my local

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:22,739
meetup to I talked about I think it was

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,070
jQuery Mobile which is kind of a

00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:26,719
not a very fashionable technology choice

00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,310
[Laughter]

00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,930
but it was funny because at the end of

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,840
my talk people were more excited about

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,969
the slide plug-in that I'd written in

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,370
the actual content of my talk that was

00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:44,639
back when exactly 2011 I think it was oh

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:46,409
that was a long time ago yeah and so I

00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,019
think that actually had a big impact on

00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,639
me that what I created and what I

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:52,950
contributed to the community had a much

00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:55,049
bigger impact than just parroting some

00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:57,409
opinions about a something unconsumed

00:02:55,049 --> 00:03:01,739
and I think it had a big impact on me

00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:03,709
okay so I want to ask - I am pretty sure

00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:06,150
it affected you in song somehow

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:09,719
personally but in your professional

00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,650
career how did open-source contributed

00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:15,659
to your like your professional how do

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,689
you evolved during the years

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:20,909
professionally I think there's there's a

00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,530
there's a couple of things I think the

00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:25,200
the first thing is that I think it's

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,540
where I actually learnt how to think

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,449
more architectural about my work because

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,180
when I go to work often what I was

00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:36,329
dealing with was just these big code

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,769
bases where you know you would just go

00:03:36,329 --> 00:03:40,590
and throw more code into this massive

00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,180
pile of code right and open source was

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,599
what really trained me to think about

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,970
breaking problems apart you know jQuery

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,799
I talked about jQuery plugins but you

00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,590
know it's it's a humble beginning but

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,290
like it taught me the idea of the whole

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:57,209
concept of trying to create a core on

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,009
which you can build plugins and then you

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:00,780
can have an ecosystem of plugins around

00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,560
that and even those plugins could have

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,329
their own plugins and it just meant that

00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,159
people were able to better break apart

00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,919
the work and sort of spread it around

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,340
and contribute asynchronously which was

00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:15,750
interesting for me and and I think it

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,109
just taught me how to build things in

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,519
that way and and I think it it was an

00:04:19,109 --> 00:04:21,690
opportunity for me to practice that in

00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,349
the way that I think a lot of people at

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,610
work didn't get to practice that but

00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:29,009
then the other thing as well I think is

00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:32,490
it helped connect me to the to the world

00:04:29,009 --> 00:04:34,440
again like if all I ever did was just go

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,409
to work and and do the work that was

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,809
right in front of me and

00:04:35,409 --> 00:04:39,749
that was it I didn't have that same

00:04:37,809 --> 00:04:42,999
connection to the broader community and

00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:46,089
that that continues to be a big

00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:48,729
influence on me making me feel like I'm

00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:50,259
not just bringing the best ideas I can

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:51,939
come up with I'm bringing kind of the

00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:53,789
best ideas I'm getting from the wider

00:04:51,939 --> 00:04:56,319
community and sharing those ideas and

00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:58,360
challenging them and and getting other

00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:59,709
people's views on it and that's what

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,749
these events are obviously all about as

00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:07,989
well so those are the two big things for

00:05:01,749 --> 00:05:11,889
me yeah so another thing is I think

00:05:07,989 --> 00:05:14,709
personally that with open-source in

00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:16,719
general that that's one of the most

00:05:14,709 --> 00:05:19,119
important parts of JavaScript nowadays

00:05:16,719 --> 00:05:21,509
and one of the powers of JavaScript and

00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:29,529
I think you can kind of increase on that

00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:31,539
but also it brings us like coming up

00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:35,589
with new ideas and libraries and stuff

00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:37,719
like that all the time it can be really

00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:40,269
hard to keep up with all this change and

00:05:37,719 --> 00:05:42,639
if you're in open sewers and going to

00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:44,949
Twitter and whatever all the time you

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,589
might kind of be okay with keep them up

00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:52,539
with that but there's this so-called

00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:54,490
fear of missing out which is I think

00:05:52,539 --> 00:06:00,309
especially in the JavaScript community

00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:05,349
or super important part I'd like to ask

00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:07,869
max this question what do you think is a

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:10,569
good way to deal with this fear of

00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:13,569
missing out so how can you keep up to

00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:15,489
date without having to like relearn and

00:06:13,569 --> 00:06:18,099
check everything like every week or

00:06:15,489 --> 00:06:20,559
something like that so I'm going to talk

00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:22,329
about this a little bit from the San

00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:25,119
Francisco perspective and then apply it

00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:27,129
to JavaScript so because in San

00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:29,979
Francisco obviously in the Bay Area in

00:06:27,129 --> 00:06:31,269
general there's a huge amount of fear of

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,529
missing out where people are always

00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:34,569
trying to jump onto the next thing

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:36,849
I think once you realize a couple of

00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:38,769
basic facts about the way things work in

00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:41,769
the Bay Area it kind of cures you of

00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:44,259
that disease so I moved to San Francisco

00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:46,059
thinking that since there is so much

00:06:44,259 --> 00:06:47,050
innovation so many startups there that I

00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:50,080
was going to encounter

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:52,599
just an insane amount of brilliant

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,639
people really doing smart stuff after

00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,789
all like if someone was willing to give

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,139
you twenty million dollars to like go do

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,360
something like they wouldn't do that

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:02,379
unless you're really smart right turns

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,849
out that's not true at all

00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:09,940
it's because the VCS they the the money

00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:11,740
that they do make is they make so much

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,930
in returns from the successful companies

00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:16,139
that it's in their best interest to kind

00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:18,400
of just spread it around so when I

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,419
realize this I realized that most of the

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,180
people even though they had a lot of

00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:23,830
money weren't necessarily doing

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,319
something intelligent or something smart

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,240
and in fact within five years something

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,280
like 90 to 95 percent of all startups

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,090
are out of business and even the bigger

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:36,370
startups a lot of them don't go a lot of

00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,289
them don't go public or or get bought

00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:40,509
out they don't have an exit for you know

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:42,580
will over eight to ten or even longer

00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:44,590
years so even if you were one early guy

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,539
your your stocks may have expired by

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:48,400
then so once you realize that it's like

00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:51,849
okay really

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,740
i it's actually I'm more of a more of a

00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:55,569
fear of getting conned by the next thing

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,009
but then I do have a fear of missing out

00:07:55,569 --> 00:07:58,419
because the next thing that everyone's

00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:01,180
jumping on whether it's you know

00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,509
blockchain or what it would have you if

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,919
I'd to illy and you're all excited it's

00:08:04,509 --> 00:08:08,289
it's not necessarily gonna work out

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,199
better for me or for the community at

00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:12,490
large and then there's another there's

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,960
other factors like if you're if you have

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,000
no responsibilities and you're young

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,460
then go ahead take a chance if you're

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,110
more of a figure more mature than you

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,300
know you have to take a more measured

00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:26,050
response so if you take that and apply

00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,639
it to technology I think that there is a

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,400
lot of this especially in the front-end

00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,099
community about four four years ago with

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,320
frameworks you know react backbone

00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,579
angular that sort of thing and there is

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,959
a little bit of fear missing out there

00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:41,770
where everyone was trying to jump on the

00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:44,019
the next thing and then so kind of

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:46,149
taking a step back and like ignoring it

00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:47,829
for a while it would have been the smart

00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:49,870
thing to do because if you had jumped

00:08:47,829 --> 00:08:51,220
say you chose backbone four years ago in

00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,899
your app is still on backbone today

00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,430
that's gonna cost you millions of

00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,170
dollars because now you have to hire a

00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:57,840
bunch of people to rewrite it or we have

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:01,200
to find people to do it and

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:04,770
to do that so so kind of learning that

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,560
lesson kind of help help me temper my

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,940
approach both to dealing with companies

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,280
in the Bay Area but also dealing with

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,230
technology and you have to kind of calm

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,460
down and see see what the community at

00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,950
large and this is one thing that we kind

00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,420
of rely on often open-source people you

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:19,470
got to be careful with the open with the

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,030
open source community because there

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,010
really that's all they do they're really

00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:24,270
excited about the next thing whereas

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,530
your honor product you like would have

00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:28,230
been i've got like thousands of

00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:30,480
components and a million users like i

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,160
need to take it easy before i start

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,930
spending all this money updating to the

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,880
next new thing it's acted and if once

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,440
you realize that again it's a fear of

00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,360
being conned you could really cost

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,540
yourself millions and millions of

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,370
dollars because of a stupid fear when

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,350
really you need a smart fear which the

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,560
which is like the fear of losing all

00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:55,080
this money and wasting all this time

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:58,320
yeah so yeah though that we're speaking

00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,460
about open source one question for you

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:08,790
who of you does remember mo tools raise

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:11,640
your hand please because we're daniel

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:13,710
just joined us and he actually was a

00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,110
core member of the motor wills back in

00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:18,620
the days and i'd like to ask you the

00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:21,570
question how do you feel about it today

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,390
how do we see the progress in javascript

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:27,750
from module two what is it is today and

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,970
maybe even where do you see your eye

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,880
development is going in for example ten

00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,290
years thank you hi it's a very

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,440
interesting question

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:40,860
I wasn't core member I was there but I

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,230
wasn't core member the core members was

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,440
a group for ten people sandwich it's a

00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:50,160
very interesting way they are right now

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,810
so Tomoaki know is the director of

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,630
facebook engineering Jana Carson is the

00:10:54,810 --> 00:11:00,080
author of the Facebook relay the graph

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:03,630
QL library

00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:06,330
Guillermo German rock is the founder of

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:09,070
site and outer of many open source

00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:12,070
software he and Kison

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,380
maybe so this is ready for me almost all

00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:18,070
those people ends up in the Facebook

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,980
engineering and made the current

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,600
maintainer of the reactor Sebastian

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:29,860
Magwitch of soccer developer of Muto's

00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,870
so they those gasps two guys made open

00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:37,660
companies and the rest of them are

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:39,819
working for it's still interesting after

00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:42,790
so many years from the Muto's we are

00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:44,889
still doing and thinking about the same

00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:48,310
how the web application should look like

00:11:44,889 --> 00:11:50,800
how should be designed if you don't

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,800
remember what the Muto's was it was the

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,259
competitor of the jquery built on some

00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,790
opie technics object of object-oriented

00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:04,480
programming and then because Muto's

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,339
wasn't as successful as jquery and there

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,360
were some different opinions about how

00:12:06,339 --> 00:12:12,970
things should be done then went to the

00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:19,050
Facebook and made react and all the

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:23,490
stuff and for me the future is probably

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:27,399
incremental don't expect anything

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:32,019
breathtaking breathtaking no breaking

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:34,779
big breaking changes because the it

00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:38,110
looks like this some guy invented

00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:41,470
something new but it's all incremental

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:42,459
progressive work so we can see the react

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,500
works

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:49,779
tobert is basically algebraic I think

00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,569
effects in JavaScript we can we will see

00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:56,260
the improving JavaScript maybe the

00:12:52,569 --> 00:13:00,670
people the switched reason maybe not I'm

00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:03,459
not sure but if you want to know what

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,610
will be will be popular in the next

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:09,370
three years take a look at the people

00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:12,550
who are productive right now I'm by the

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:16,960
people I mean I mean the people around

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:19,310
the react team and Facebook engineering

00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,350
thank you

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:24,650
we're doing one more question from our

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,690
list and then we'll try to see if any

00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:28,280
one of you got any questions because I

00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:32,150
don't think we got this

00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:33,710
I'd say okay I wasn't aware so we've got

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,720
one more question then we will take some

00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:42,170
of those and this question is for Anna

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,990
and I was pretty excited when I heard

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:51,250
you're studying psychology because I am

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:55,070
doing this as well and I want to yeah

00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:58,910
yeah it looks like that's a common thing

00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:01,820
actually but I want to know why you're

00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:04,880
doing it and especially in context of

00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:07,850
development how does it affect your

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,040
engineering career and there were quite

00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:12,560
a few reasons one of them was that I was

00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,230
at a very miserable job where we were

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,000
doing react wrapped up in net and I was

00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,750
kind of wondering why am I doing this to

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,370
myself on a daily basis so I decided

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:25,400
that I want to do something different

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,990
and I bumped into a psychotherapy cause

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,030
I thought it might be interesting and I

00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,950
really loved it but I also realized that

00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:37,130
we always ask ourself questions in

00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,900
development how do we do something what

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,760
framework do Ishi's what tools do we

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,980
choose but we very rarely ask ourselves

00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:45,910
the question why do we do something and

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:48,890
I actually really miss the sort of

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:50,390
philosophical level to it because I

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,880
believe it's really important for us as

00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:54,290
human beings to know why we're doing it

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,950
you know like the fact that we earn

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,810
money or that it's fun to explore new

00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:01,400
things that's great but you know we all

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:05,030
can burn out we all can have

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,010
difficulties in our careers and knowing

00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,800
why we're doing it and being really

00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:12,520
aware of where we are as human beings

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,650
actually proved really important for me

00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:18,380
that's really really interesting I want

00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:23,300
to ask do something related to this

00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:25,550
which is that I know that personally if

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:27,620
I am only thinking about programming all

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:28,819
the time and programming thinking about

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:30,889
code and

00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:32,539
obsessed with technology working too

00:15:30,889 --> 00:15:34,519
many hours it's like sometimes I feel

00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:37,009
like it's super difficult to wrap my

00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,049
head around what I'm doing so I need to

00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:41,479
jump into something else and maybe those

00:15:39,049 --> 00:15:43,579
ideas new ideas are coming to my mind or

00:15:41,479 --> 00:15:48,169
new solutions or whatever so I am

00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:52,699
curious about if you dedicate yourself

00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:55,819
to a different feel like psychology is

00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:59,199
see if you felt like that at some point

00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:02,059
like it helped you becoming a better

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,919
developer doing something else I think

00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:05,899
so I think that's true for everyone you

00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:08,449
know like we are in an industry where

00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:10,639
we're constantly told that if we were to

00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:13,369
be hired we need to be enthusiastic and

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,959
you know do extracurricular activities

00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:16,669
all the time people are wondering

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,229
whether you're contributing to open

00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:20,299
source and how much you're doing outside

00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:22,429
of your day to day job so there the

00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:26,319
pressure on us to do things like

00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:29,209
programming all the time is massive and

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:31,850
being able to get out of it is really

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,519
important like I find for example that

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,959
if I go for a run like halfway through

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:37,759
the day it really helps me to find a

00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:40,339
solution to the bugs that I was like

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,499
looking at in the morning so switching

00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:44,149
context works really well there's

00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:46,549
actually a psychological theory behind

00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:48,169
that and that is that essentially we've

00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:49,339
got conscious and unconscious mind and

00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:50,809
the conscious mind is the one that

00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:52,729
constantly thinks and we're aware of

00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:54,619
what we're thinking but there is the

00:16:52,729 --> 00:16:56,929
unconscious mind that is essentially a

00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:58,459
little bit like a storage where you're

00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:00,559
sort of like just pushing extra

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:03,649
information and it's processing the

00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,299
information slowly in its own time so if

00:17:03,649 --> 00:17:07,309
you find yourself really stuck on a

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:08,929
problem stop thinking about it

00:17:07,309 --> 00:17:10,970
let it's sort of sinking into the

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,769
unconscious it will process it on its

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,870
own and then later on at some point it

00:17:12,769 --> 00:17:16,669
will just like pop out the answer so

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,389
it's unreliable but it's it's sometimes

00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:21,589
really helpful

00:17:17,389 --> 00:17:24,529
ok I'm studying psychology you know so

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,389
we're on axe ask you some questions guys

00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:29,960
that we have during in slide oh now

00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:32,750
first one is computer science degree or

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,360
similar required how relevant is that

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:37,700
today in hiring developers I think

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,429
that's a very interesting one I hang

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:42,500
interested on about knowing if all of

00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:44,570
you are sharing like the same

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,040
in background or if you come from

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,770
different places I think that's super

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:53,450
interesting so who wants to start with

00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:55,550
that I don't have any degree great so

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:59,420
I'm a self-taught engineer and all right

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,370
I'm that's unusual at PayPal although I

00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:02,600
think I think correct me if I'm wrong I

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,890
think most of the react team actually

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,070
does not have a computer science degree

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:10,070
but that's another thing but anyway I

00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:12,530
think for it depends on the position is

00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:16,340
is my answer to this question and I

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:21,050
think that it it's very rare that the

00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:23,030
position requires it so so I think that

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,010
in how relevant is so if you're working

00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,360
on like an auto someone's hiring you to

00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:29,300
build an autocomplete or something like

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,590
that or a search then I think that if if

00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,880
you don't have a computer science degree

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:36,620
it's it's very fair for them to ask you

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,150
very advanced computer science related

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,380
questions because that's going to be

00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:41,570
directly relevant to what you're doing

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,610
if you're getting hired to build you

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:46,430
eyes I think it's absolutely ludicrous

00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:49,250
to heart to ask to hire based on these

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:51,170
questions and I actively discourage my

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,320
team actually from act asking any

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,600
algorithms whatsoever in in hiring and I

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,890
thats not that's not common at I work at

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,230
PayPal for those of you don't know

00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,580
that's not common at PayPal but amongst

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:05,930
my team I try to tell them not to

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:09,020
because I care much more about I I don't

00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,850
feel like we get a good idea of how this

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,410
person is going to work am I going to be

00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:15,100
is this person going to be able to do

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:17,990
the job based on whether or not they can

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,340
complete several difficult algorithm

00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,900
questions especially when you're talking

00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,330
about front-end developers and node

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,340
developers again it'd be a different

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,750
thing if we were talking about search if

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,720
we were hiring someone to do a search or

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,460
something like that but I think it

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,940
should be mentioned that Google of

00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,590
Facebook and some some several other

00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,200
companies recently dropped the

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,080
requirement to have a degree and as I

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,910
remember the Apple doesn't even does

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,460
that my friend he's working on Siri and

00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:52,040
they hired him because they liked him he

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:54,520
was actually core developer of the move

00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:56,650
of the angular of the angular

00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:59,610
I told him we will turn you what we need

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:02,380
so we like your personality and culture

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,770
culture approach and if you are good

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,360
person if you are if you you won't if

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:10,360
you want to learn something new or

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,490
something like that so I think the text

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,070
school degree is not relevant anymore

00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:18,430
and if you want to need more information

00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:22,350
Google and schooling and you will soon

00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,610
realize that the classic school is

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,350
so I think that that was actually more

00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,060
of a public relations thing because the

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,710
interview process doesn't reflect that

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:31,660
policy at all I think that actually

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,190
Facebook is trying to incorporate more

00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,510
of a front end interview which I think

00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,420
is a little bit more friendly to self

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,220
self-taught developers but I mean say

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,960
Google says ok we're now going to not

00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:43,120
have a requirement for a computer

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,220
science degree the the ridiculous

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,560
interview process already severely

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,120
biases them towards younger people's

00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:52,360
fresh out of computer science which is

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,550
who they primarily hire but I think is a

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:56,110
mistake personally but I mean they've

00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,030
tried other things and then they just

00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,800
said this is what works best for us so

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,180
maybe that's ok but what the problem

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,980
really is that it's trickled down to the

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,590
rest of the industry and other than once

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:07,780
once like other startups like I don't

00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,430
know Airbnb uber coinbase once they

00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,990
start to get successful they think oh

00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,130
it's now it's time to grow up and be

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:13,720
more like Google and have this

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:15,430
ridiculous interview process that's

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,700
isn't that so very interesting it's a

00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:20,230
real it's a in my opinion like the

00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,930
interview process is the single worst

00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:24,970
part about my job and like I think it's

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:26,380
a it's a poison on the entire industry

00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,780
actually I think that there needs to be

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:30,160
a more progressive approach and people

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,230
need to actually think creatively and

00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,730
outside the box and the worst part is

00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:35,650
when I talk to a lot of people from

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:37,120
Google Facebook all over the valley they

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,650
all seem to know this but no one really

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,960
does anything about it they just talk

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,580
about it and it's like well but the

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,340
director-level people aren't willing to

00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:47,740
listen to us so it's it's frustrating

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,510
what like I said what I do I have

00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,250
influence on my team I have influence in

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,360
my organization but I don't have

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:54,160
influence in the whole company and I

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,090
certainly don't influence anyone beyond

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:59,560
my company anyway that's my opinion I I

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,600
just want to add that when we are hiring

00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,830
developers we very rarely look at

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,500
whether they have computer science

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:07,340
degree and or even whether they have the

00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,680
actual skill set of that where you

00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:12,260
using we are looking at whether the

00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,240
person wants to learn and that was

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,440
really the most important thing and and

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,190
there has been the case in a lot of

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:21,020
companies where I've worked so personal

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,730
I just want to add that personally I

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,710
think that the best way to interview a

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:27,320
candidate is to go through a trial where

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:29,810
you can just you know work with this

00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:32,420
person for some time and see how it

00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:34,490
performs and if he's capable of solving

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:37,280
problems that you have in your day in a

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:39,380
day-by-day basis but also I like your

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:42,200
point but it is true that when a company

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,300
is getting so so so big it's very

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,960
difficult to get somebody into that

00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:49,940
super hardcore organization so they can

00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,610
contribute for maybe one week one month

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:55,850
or whatever and then decide whether it's

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,480
a good a good choice or if it's not but

00:22:55,850 --> 00:23:01,760
that's up I don't like it either

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:05,900
so we want to jump to the next question

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:09,140
which is have ya have you ever join a

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,570
company take sorry I'm I'm I'm

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,670
have you ever joined a company taking

00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:15,650
one look around and instantly wanted to

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,040
change everything about how they worked

00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:19,910
and if so did you do it that's

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,840
interesting too

00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:27,500
so anybody I I've sort of gone through

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,450
this it's actually where I work now I've

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,120
been there for about five years and it

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:34,760
the company has changed ridiculously in

00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:39,290
that amount of time I can't take all the

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,660
credit I can take some of it like a lot

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:45,620
of different areas have changed when I

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:47,840
showed up as far as front end was

00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:51,350
concerned they were very much like a

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:54,080
dotnet shop or the JavaScript code was

00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:58,220
like in a in a folder deep within a

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,890
dotnet project and it wasn't using any

00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:02,990
of the when you think five years ago

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:04,520
like that the the state of JavaScript

00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,540
tooling was not where it is today but

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,940
but sort of node based testing tools for

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,250
example were starting to become a bit

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,970
more popular tolling like that wasn't

00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:18,770
being used within the within the company

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,840
there was like one team that was doing a

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:23,330
JavaScript single page up there

00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:25,130
doing the mobile site separate mobile

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:27,770
site we're responsive now but at the

00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:30,679
time it was a separate site and that was

00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,419
an angular single page app and that was

00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:33,799
like the Holy Land if you were a if you

00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:35,570
were a JavaScript developer joining this

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:40,190
company it was like get me on the mobile

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:43,010
team but yeah I worked really hard over

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:46,159
a number of years to to change the

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,990
culture and try and get a bit more of

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,309
the mainstream kind of open source

00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:52,429
JavaScript culture embedded in the

00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:55,070
company and it took a lot of work and a

00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:57,470
lot of influencing but we managed to

00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,570
turn it around we actually got we

00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,549
managed to get the home page of the site

00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,350
and keep in mind this is like one of the

00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:06,020
biggest sites in Australia we got the

00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:08,480
home page server ended react on an like

00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:09,799
a node server super progressive for this

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,470
company right over in terms of where

00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:14,149
we'd come from so I think you can turn

00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:17,690
it around it just it can take a long

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:21,710
time and a lot of effort but yeah it can

00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:22,370
be done nice anybody else want to add

00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:25,460
something to that

00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:28,580
cool so we're gonna get together the

00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:30,440
next two questions which is how can I

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,200
start contributing to open source as a

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,059
beginner developer most project seems to

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,640
be quite complex and I don't know what

00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:39,799
can I do for it and the other one I

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,409
think it's pretty related which is

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:45,289
contributing to open source difficult in

00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:47,179
terms of work-life balance like the

00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:51,409
first question is actually answering the

00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:53,179
second one I guess difficult is not that

00:25:51,409 --> 00:26:00,380
difficult happens of the project in my

00:25:53,179 --> 00:26:05,899
opinion but you guys so first of all the

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:08,240
traffic the first question I think the

00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:11,960
the best thing you can do is if you want

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,179
to contribute to your open source is to

00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,809
check if there's anything that in

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:20,240
channel you are not happy with and this

00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,159
library or tool or whatever and not like

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,970
going there okay I want to contribute

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:27,500
what can I do because most of the time

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,299
when you're using something you will

00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:32,419
come up with an issue at any point

00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:33,940
pretty often and then you know the

00:26:32,419 --> 00:26:36,580
context and everything

00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,950
and then you can get in contact with the

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:42,220
maintenance and whatever and in general

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:45,909
most of the open-source maintainer czar

00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:47,950
happy if they get contributors and they

00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:50,139
are super happy to help you and guide

00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:52,240
you through the process of contributing

00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:57,039
and I think the most important thing is

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:59,529
to not be like shy or to not have any

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,860
fear of just trying and doing because

00:26:59,529 --> 00:27:06,129
even if you're sending in a poll request

00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:10,179
that is later not accepted it's still

00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:11,950
important to send it because it's going

00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,350
to start a discussion and you learn the

00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:17,440
process and everything

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:20,399
yeah and that's I think the the most

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:24,639
important part of open source and

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:29,289
especially with this project is super

00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:31,360
complex I kind of have this feeling on

00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:34,149
my own with my own open-source projects

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,740
from time to time when I come back after

00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:39,639
some weeks and I want to fix something

00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:43,539
and I'm like oh what I don't understand

00:27:39,639 --> 00:27:45,669
anything and then again it's it's super

00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:48,009
fun if you ask them they are super happy

00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:50,230
to help so most of the times they have

00:27:48,009 --> 00:27:53,200
at least some contributing guides which

00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:55,450
you can check and just play around with

00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,100
the repository and you will get into the

00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:02,830
code at some point yeah then the next

00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:04,690
question may we can add something on

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:09,970
that later but once you say something to

00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:12,129
the next question it can be difficult in

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,899
terms of work-life balance especially in

00:28:12,129 --> 00:28:16,090
the beginning if you're getting into

00:28:13,899 --> 00:28:20,190
your open-source and you get some

00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:23,440
contributors some users and whatever and

00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:25,240
it's a super nice experience having

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,100
people using your library and you want

00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,840
to provide the best experience and you

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,210
put a lot of time and there are new

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,129
fakes and stuff you add new features

00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:36,429
you're probably not even using yourself

00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:39,370
and you can quickly come to a point

00:28:36,429 --> 00:28:41,289
where it's kind of burning you out and

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,350
you might not even realize it at that

00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:47,040
point and I've seen a lot of open source

00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:51,090
developers reaching that point

00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:54,390
sometime then taking a break or just

00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:57,320
giving the project to someone else in

00:28:54,390 --> 00:29:01,350
general and they learn from this process

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:05,940
but if I should give it an advice as

00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:09,750
probably to not rush on any every issue

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,180
to fix it and whatever because you can

00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:14,730
also ask people to send poll requests

00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:17,100
then you get more contributors you get a

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:18,560
lot more like a group of people

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:21,090
contributing

00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:24,210
yeah and it's your free time that's the

00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:26,400
most important thing is it you don't

00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,830
have to do anything of that it's your

00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,610
free project everyone can fork it

00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:34,440
contribute whatever and yeah that's the

00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,290
point if you're not happy with the

00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,970
situation if you feel overwhelmed just

00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:41,370
stop it because you're not getting any

00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,350
money obviously and it's just not worth

00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,570
it and then there's the other way

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:48,150
especially if you're working at a bigger

00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:51,030
company you might you might go and ask

00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:53,520
them if there's the possibility to spend

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:55,640
some work time to contribute to the open

00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,420
source project especially if you're

00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,640
using this library at your company then

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:05,520
it's they will most likely be like okay

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,510
you can have 20% of your time or

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:11,820
something like that and that can help to

00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:13,530
improve your work-life balance it can

00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,800
help to improve the library in general

00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:19,110
and in the end it helps your employee

00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:23,330
because you're working on this library

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:26,130
but not getting sick it over time yeah I

00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:28,230
would just like to answer the first

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:30,630
question in a bit more detail and that

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,460
is there are quite a few repositories

00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:34,560
and open source projects that are very

00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,230
well managed and they have labels that

00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,760
are specifically for beginners so they

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:40,380
are generally speaking issues that are

00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,170
very easy to pick up I know for example

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,660
the service framework has has things

00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:47,730
like that but I know that a lot of large

00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,850
frameworks would have these kind of

00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:53,720
labels also a lot of these places would

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,680
have slack what is called channels where

00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,330
people are very happy to walk you

00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:59,690
through it explain to you how to run the

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,740
project etc

00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:05,360
I would say if you just want to sort of

00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:07,100
see if you can do a little bit here in

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,570
there then large projects that have

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,790
proper management behind them are the

00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,500
easy easiest way to go because they'll

00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:15,920
be able to help you out to get started

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,240
and yes it is impossible to have

00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,260
work/life balance we're doing

00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:24,140
hopefulness I think there's another

00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:27,980
option here as well that worked well for

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:29,780
me which is just go and build your own

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,540
stuff don't try and contribute to other

00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,830
people's stuff at the beginning it's

00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,770
like I said it's just a different

00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,030
approach but I like for me I found that

00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,100
that actually was really useful because

00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:42,230
it gave me that kind of free space to

00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,330
explore kind of end to end how does open

00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:47,300
source work because I had to I had to do

00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,700
everything I had to you know write the

00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:52,429
documentation I had to figure out how to

00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:57,679
publish it I had to really learn about

00:31:52,429 --> 00:32:00,650
how versioning works and I had to yeah

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,450
just just end-to-end but I was doing it

00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:04,040
in a space where I had complete freedom

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,440
and I didn't have to worry too much and

00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,929
then just copy and then just blatantly

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,670
copy everything that you can see so if

00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,650
you're in my case going back you know

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:14,450
five years ago I was just looking at

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:16,940
other jQuery plugins that I liked and I

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,170
was like okay what are they doing and I

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,240
would just copy and I would and I would

00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,740
pick up all sorts of stuff like oh this

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,100
one has unit tests I've never written

00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:26,630
unittest before copy paste tweak like

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,000
okay now I'm running my first unit tests

00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:32,270
and I learnt so much that way like a

00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:35,750
heap and yeah like I said I because it

00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,770
was all in my own space that I created I

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,290
didn't have to ask anyone's permission

00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:42,290
to do any of this I could just endlessly

00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:44,600
kind of learn new things and plug them

00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:46,670
into this repository and I think that

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,900
that gives you a maybe a better

00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:49,400
foundation that when you start to

00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,960
contribute to other projects you have a

00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,660
better sense of how it all kind of hangs

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,559
together yeah yeah I think that's a very

00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:59,809
good point like the best way to learn is

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:01,730
just to start your own stuff and just

00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:05,360
play around with it and get your mind

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:08,780
around how the whole thing works but I

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,419
want also to add that as a beginner when

00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:12,429
you are visiting somewhere

00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:14,919
open-source project that you want to

00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:18,249
contribute to you should never ever ever

00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:20,169
be afraid or asking of asking even

00:33:18,249 --> 00:33:22,299
though maybe you are thinking that

00:33:20,169 --> 00:33:23,919
you're about to ask something super

00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:27,070
stupid and you are going to look like an

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,529
idiot still maybe that question is not

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:31,989
that stupid I'm pretty sure everyone in

00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:34,629
college or in high school experience

00:33:31,989 --> 00:33:38,440
that from teachers like don't be afraid

00:33:34,629 --> 00:33:40,239
to ask also I think it's super important

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,639
that if you want to contribute to a

00:33:40,239 --> 00:33:45,820
open-source project you should already

00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:48,340
be using that project somehow like

00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:51,100
getting time just to dedicate just for

00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,960
free because you just are going to sit

00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,059
in front of the computer and start

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,889
reading code and try to made up

00:33:55,059 --> 00:33:58,659
something you'll get at issue and solve

00:33:56,889 --> 00:34:00,609
it when the project is not related at

00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:02,259
all with your work that's almost

00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:04,179
impossible that's a maintainable it's

00:34:02,259 --> 00:34:06,100
going to last for one week after that

00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:13,450
you're gonna get frustrated and go back

00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:17,500
to your hole so yeah just to finish this

00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:21,399
off I think another important concept is

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:25,119
to not being a thread at all at failing

00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:26,919
in general because you if you're looking

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,809
at an open source project with a lot of

00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:30,790
stars and whatever maybe there are

00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:32,649
people speaking at conferences and

00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,929
everything and you might have this

00:34:32,649 --> 00:34:38,409
feeling like oh they are like super

00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:42,010
professionals and they never do fail and

00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:43,960
whatever and you might be afraid of even

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:48,240
asking them something because they are

00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:51,639
way higher than you but of course

00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:54,280
obviously there's a beginning for

00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:58,210
everyone and all of them started at some

00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:03,420
point and they got up there by failing a

00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:07,150
lot as well yeah and that's the

00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,369
something I want to ask next because now

00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,940
we only talked about some kind of

00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:17,109
positive stuff but I want to get a bit

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:19,329
sensitive and ask first of all sorry but

00:35:17,109 --> 00:35:23,260
we can maybe have other answers if you

00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:26,530
want to because I know he got a super

00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,300
kind of interesting and funny story so

00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:32,410
what was your biggest failure as a

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:35,740
developer my biggest failure was trying

00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:37,390
to be too professional like literally I

00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,190
was working for a company a couple of

00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:41,230
years no a kappa but more like four

00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:43,300
years ago or something like that I was

00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:45,610
working for this company I was doing

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:48,850
Ruby back-end development and I remember

00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:51,820
the world there was this bug super

00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:55,180
annoying in production and we were able

00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:57,670
to reproduce that in staging so since I

00:35:55,180 --> 00:36:02,170
couldn't reproduce the bug locally what

00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:05,500
I did is to point or test fit to the

00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:10,000
staging database so I was able to write

00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:11,830
a test to reproduce the the back and as

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,890
a good professional I wanted to write

00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:18,580
first the failing test so I did the test

00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:22,930
it failed and I fixed the test and then

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:25,780
before pushing I wanted to run the whole

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:29,350
pet suit to make to make sure I didn't

00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:31,330
break anything so you know what I forgot

00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,240
to change the reference to the database

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:37,600
and of course it dropped after the whole

00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,400
test is run I basically dropped the

00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,850
whole database that we have in a staging

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,370
that took like two years to the bit has

00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:48,670
like two years of data to reproduce like

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,530
kind of production stuff luckily there

00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,350
was a backup over there

00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,680
but I was like like frozen like oh my

00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,290
god

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,940
what did I do for the record nothing

00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,710
happening after that like just

00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:03,130
happens it's fine

00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:08,980
don't be afraid but don't don't delete

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:11,020
the production that any other story yeah

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:13,780
I I mentioned earlier that we did our

00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:16,060
first like server rendered reactor at

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:19,120
seek where I work so we were out in

00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:21,430
production to a subset of users not 100%

00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:24,720
but we were out in production and it was

00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:28,450
it was actually the first CSS modules

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,960
project and we were using this standard

00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:34,450
kind of hashed class names in production

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,910
but I saw Glenn Madden among some other

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:38,320
people were being pretty clear

00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:39,670
with it and they were using emojis

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,980
instead of hashes if any of you've seen

00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:43,960
that so when you open the dev tools or

00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:46,060
view source every class name when every

00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,180
element element was an emoji or a series

00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:53,230
of emojis and I really wanted to do that

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:54,550
I thought it would be funny so I it was

00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,080
supported by web pack so I literally

00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:58,510
just swapped it out the hash for an

00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:02,500
emoji checked it on my local environment

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:05,200
looked fine and went out to production

00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:07,240
and I think there was an issue with like

00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,100
the character encoding where the values

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,590
coming back from the server for the HTML

00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,910
were different from the CSS file and it

00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:16,300
actually just basically meant there was

00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:18,640
zero CSS on our site and our build

00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,810
pipeline even though it was like so we

00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,160
had continuous delivery I was able to

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:24,070
fix it but it was like a 10-minute

00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:27,550
window of where like one of the biggest

00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:29,140
sites in Australia had no CSS and like

00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,430
six a pretty good company like a lot of

00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,830
companies where if you make an honest

00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,250
mistake and you own up to it it'll be

00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,740
fine

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:38,050
but it was like the stupidest reason why

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:40,150
I did it like I knew that if anyone

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,130
asked me like hey so what's the story

00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:46,140
like what went wrong and if I had to

00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:50,260
explain it so luckily no one actually

00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:52,030
like III I solved that problem by being

00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:54,730
very much on the front foot and

00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:56,050
explaining before I was asked that

00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:58,360
something went wrong I'm already on it

00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:00,820
I'm fixing it I don't think I said that

00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:03,550
it was because it was emojis

00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:06,580
no one asked me but I learned a valuable

00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:08,770
lesson don't like don't do don't do

00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:11,110
things that you you couldn't explain

00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:17,050
with a straight face you can make minus

00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:20,290
mistakes but don't be stupid any other

00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:23,680
 up stories I was working at Pizza

00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:25,300
Hut relatively recently where we did the

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,730
whole revamp for the route for the

00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:30,280
website and react and everything's we're

00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,140
great but the problem was that we the

00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,940
moment we merge to master is shipped

00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:36,400
into production we didn't really we had

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,920
100% test coverage but all those tests

00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,130
were only written to have 100% test

00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,900
coverage so they didn't test anything we

00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,490
didn't really do code reviews because

00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,710
there was just slowing us down and

00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:49,770
obviously we had no queue ace so

00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:51,810
essentially the thing was that I

00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:54,180
the developer was fully responsible for

00:39:51,810 --> 00:39:57,330
things to work out and most of the time

00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,980
that was fine but after a while I got a

00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:00,330
little bit tired and especially there's

00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:02,640
this thing in pizza at wake and have

00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,470
half and half pizzas and there was a

00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,720
pain-in-the-ass t-test so I decided I

00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:09,060
won't test half and half pizzas which

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,150
was Friday afternoon and for Pizza Hut

00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:13,080
the main peaks are like you know Friday

00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:16,050
midnight when people are going home

00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:19,230
drunk so I ship this thing into into

00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:21,590
production and on Saturday morning I

00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:23,850
found out that the company lost around

00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:25,680
60,000 pounds and that one a night

00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:29,340
because people could not order

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:36,420
half-and-half beat us so that was my

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:39,600
story have you been dumped a pile some

00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:44,300
time no no it'd be way more than 60,000

00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:46,650
pounds this isn't a story but no

00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,540
something else ah I think there might be

00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:52,020
legal ramifications in some of the

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,510
stories that I have but I don't I don't

00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:56,190
have like a really like hilarious dev

00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,660
story but I will say that like some of

00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:59,940
the biggest mistakes that I've made as a

00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,430
developer or are not trusting my gut and

00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:04,710
back that can be from everything from

00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,480
like allowing someone to convince me

00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:08,610
someone to talk me into oh it's okay if

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,650
we comment out this line this test just

00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,720
for now and I'm like I know that's wrong

00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:14,640
but I guess you know I guess you talked

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,550
to me into it or everything from like I

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,410
used to I was briefly a consultant and

00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,330
you know I was I took her contract that

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:23,250
never really felt like right but they

00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,320
you know we're offering me more money so

00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:26,850
it's like I guess I'll do it and it just

00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:29,610
wasn't a good so it wasn't a good thing

00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,960
so my lesson from those things were it's

00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:32,730
better to be wrong going with your gut

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,440
than to go against your gut and then

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:39,540
find out you're wrong later okay cool so

00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,810
we're gonna do one more from the slider

00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:45,240
and then jump up jump back to some that

00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:49,260
we have prepared here so how many hours

00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:54,570
per day are you programming in my case

00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:57,570
it depends a lot on the day the week the

00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:01,140
month the Sprint the people it's a lot

00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:03,540
of stuff like maybe there's one day that

00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,890
I spent it also depends on

00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,480
where are you working at like for

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,880
example in my case I'm working remotely

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,010
so we are very flexible on the hours

00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:12,540
that we dedicate to work like if I want

00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:15,390
to work the whole night or maybe

00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,730
sometimes I am required I am required to

00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:21,180
work during the whole night I should be

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:24,000
up to do it but it depends so sometimes

00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:26,610
I spent the whole day working but in my

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,340
regular work not open source project or

00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:31,860
side projects or whatever or sometimes

00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,250
it's a little bit more relaxed but I

00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:37,200
remember this time when I was building

00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:39,300
this open source project reactive box I

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,200
remember that I was building that in a

00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:45,420
complete separate time from my job

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,930
position so the thing is that I worked

00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:52,350
for like seven to eight hours a day in

00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:54,450
my normal job and then I switch back to

00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:57,990
the open source project I was working in

00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:59,460
the result is that I worked for month

00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:02,580
and a half or two months or something

00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,160
like the whole day almost every single

00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:07,440
day so it was it was a shitload of work

00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:09,270
and that's why I was pointing out before

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,300
that if you are working in a open source

00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,610
project that you are not really using

00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:16,770
it's not it's just not working and you

00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,510
shouldn't dedicate more than I don't

00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:20,340
know I'm not gonna tell you like saving

00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:22,350
hours if you do really enjoy what you're

00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:24,540
doing what you're doing it's perfectly

00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,970
fine if you spend a little bit more but

00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:29,460
you have to find the time to relax to

00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:30,990
practice some sports or to just

00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:32,880
disconnect from what you're doing

00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:36,240
because later they're gonna be way more

00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,990
productive so in my case not less than

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:44,520
seven hours a day not much more than a

00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:46,260
ten maybe but it depends a lot sorry

00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,420
anybody here so I'll answer this

00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:49,470
question now I'll answer it first

00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:51,900
personally what I actually do and then a

00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,820
more general answer so I mean I get I

00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:57,240
get to work pretty early way before

00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:59,700
anyone else on my team so almost the

00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,260
bulk of my I would say 90% of all the

00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,000
coding I've done is I do is like the

00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:05,280
first three hours I get to work because

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,650
no one's there and then after that most

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,130
of my day is very little coding it's

00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:12,630
much more talking with other people

00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:15,000
helping other people

00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:19,170
these meetings things like that but kind

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,650
of related to this is progression as a

00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:23,760
developer you kind of have a choice

00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,070
which which way you want to go and in

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,710
general the more senior the more the

00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:30,960
more up you go the less coding you do

00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:32,130
which might seem counterintuitive but

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,900
that's that's kind of how it works you

00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:36,000
tend to be more like almost a consultant

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:38,370
for your team or your company you know

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,490
sharing your experience and sharing your

00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:43,110
wisdom with these different situations

00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,900
and acting more like an architect

00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:47,520
whereas you know actually coding UI for

00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,500
example that wouldn't be a good use of

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,470
somebody who's got you know ten years

00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,840
experience or something like that so

00:44:52,470 --> 00:44:57,150
don't be surprised if earlier on in your

00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,410
career you're coding a lot more this is

00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:01,110
different for if you're doing working on

00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:03,360
open source by the way but if you're you

00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:06,000
know working on a product don't be

00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:08,280
surprised if you code less and less as

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,410
you progress and then also I mean as a

00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,160
sign of a really good program it's like

00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:15,510
you wrote it and it doesn't need it just

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,220
works I mean if you if you wrote

00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,540
something and your team and your company

00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:21,470
is still using it like two or three

00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:23,790
years down the road great like you're

00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:26,100
like attend some meetings and go home

00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:30,420
like you you really earned your your

00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:32,880
your keep so my answer for how many

00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:35,640
horse per day are programming what

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,850
programming is is it thinking and do you

00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,780
want to think fast or slow which kind of

00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:44,940
thinking is better

00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:47,490
I bet the slow thinking slow deep so

00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:49,320
from this point of the view some people

00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:53,400
are much more productive if they work

00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:55,950
just four five six hours per day and the

00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,620
other programmers can work fifteen

00:45:55,950 --> 00:46:01,260
sixteen hours as it's totally not worth

00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,860
it because the code they produce is

00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,370
toxic

00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:08,640
baggy and always to remember the best

00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:11,880
code is the code is not written this is

00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,340
the best code you can ever write not

00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,890
existing code you will realize that

00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:22,120
after maybe to take ten years in the

00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:26,290
industry but you can count on our

00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:29,920
because it easily can be can we work for

00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:32,290
work and of course the life and work

00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:34,630
balance is very important so without the

00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:37,360
rest you will not be pretty productive

00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:39,310
and last advice my friend has a company

00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,220
he is hiring he's selling them

00:46:39,310 --> 00:46:45,490
developers to other companies and they

00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:48,250
can't work more than 6 hours per day

00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:52,150
because only six hours you can be

00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:55,090
focused productive and the rest of the

00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:58,300
day you need really need blank white

00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:01,270
spaces for the brain to relax even

00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:02,950
watching the the the eating animal or

00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:08,860
fortunately cats pictures on the

00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:11,230
Internet is the kind of drugs I want to

00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,000
add just only one more thing which is

00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:14,980
that when I said that it depends how

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,220
much time I spent working I really mean

00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,110
it like for example there was one day

00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:21,880
quite recently that I was like feeling

00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:24,400
like I couldn't do anything

00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,190
properly so I apparently worked that day

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,070
but they would this other day and it was

00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:33,430
like a pie in April or something like

00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:37,770
that that I work like 30 23 hours in a

00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:41,530
row really no

00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:44,320
all right we only got 10 minutes left

00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:54,780
and there's one more question or maybe

00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:54,780
like two questions sorry yeah we can we

00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,680
yeah we can maybe do this after this we

00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:06,960
can probably half the time but there's

00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:09,280
one more on my list which I want to ask

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,670
because obviously we are at a conference

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,520
right now and we are all conference

00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:19,840
speakers up here and might be

00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:22,300
interesting if you have any advice at

00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:24,790
all how to get into speaking at the

00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:27,520
conference so this is the first spot but

00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:29,800
then I also want to ask you are there

00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,990
any downsides you're experiencing

00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:37,550
speaking at the conference

00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:38,900
it takes time seriously if you want to

00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:40,819
go speak in the conference make

00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:44,300
something interesting and they will ask

00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:46,970
you and it's exhausting actually because

00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:50,559
if I know I will have to deliver the

00:48:46,970 --> 00:48:53,839
message I need to think at least week

00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,150
about it to deliver the message so that

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,390
30 minutes is just the complete

00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:01,910
compression of the long thinking so yes

00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:04,400
there are trade-offs I would like to

00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:07,150
explain this to ask to answer the

00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,670
self-explanatory code or good comments

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:14,089
every comment is fail but it's very

00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:17,150
common for developer to fail so every

00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:20,150
comment you have to write is actually

00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:22,970
somehow to fail but it's very common for

00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:26,559
us as developers failing all the time

00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:30,050
so comments comments are fine just fine

00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:33,079
I'll just add add to the conference

00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:35,059
question make sure you know why you want

00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:38,569
to do it whether it's you know to

00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:41,599
attract talent it's learn meet meet you

00:49:38,569 --> 00:49:43,369
know high-class developers or expose

00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,859
more people to your technology or to

00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:46,849
your opinion or make sure you understand

00:49:45,859 --> 00:49:48,650
why you're doing it and then just

00:49:46,849 --> 00:49:51,349
reimburse eyes that the Downs it's

00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:53,180
really exhausting like I'm so tired and

00:49:51,349 --> 00:49:55,460
I'm sure all you guys are too it's it's

00:49:53,180 --> 00:50:02,299
it's mentally draining and it is a lot

00:49:55,460 --> 00:50:05,750
of work it's part of that question was

00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:08,390
how to get started so I I got started

00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:10,640
personally with speaking at local

00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:12,950
meetups actually I mentioned it before

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,839
like talking about jQuery Mobile at my

00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,750
local JavaScript Meetup

00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:20,750
that was my first sort of public

00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:21,770
speaking engagement and that was that

00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,400
was really great for me was really

00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:27,770
influential kind of time for me I

00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:30,079
actually found that as somewhat I guess

00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:31,640
of an introvert I was actually really

00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,890
useful way to connect with people

00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:35,869
because people came to me to talk about

00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:38,630
what I was talking about I'm not very

00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:40,400
good at approaching other people so that

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:41,690
you know and and that continues to be

00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,799
very useful for me like I come to a

00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:44,690
conference and people are just

00:50:42,799 --> 00:50:45,920
constantly coming up to me you know

00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:46,770
talking about what I was talking about

00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,450
and

00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:50,580
naturally having conversations whereas

00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:53,250
if I go to a conference as an attendee I

00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:55,020
actually struggle to talk to people so

00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:59,730
that's I don't know I thought that might

00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:01,860
be interesting but um yeah I guess the

00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:04,230
downside is definitely the time it takes

00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:06,180
is a big thing I could go on about that

00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:08,100
I get another thing that I definitely

00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:10,140
struggle with a little bit is it's

00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:12,870
somewhat addictive talking at

00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:15,690
conferences and it which is in and out

00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:17,790
my selves not not necessarily bad but it

00:51:15,690 --> 00:51:19,980
definitely creates this Drive of like I

00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:21,900
need to make sure I've got the next

00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,300
thing to talk about and it's something

00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:26,190
of a healthy Drive but it can tend

00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:29,010
towards unhealthy sometimes because it's

00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,240
I'm just so focused on making sure I'm

00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:32,160
on the bleeding edge of something

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,200
whether or not maybe that's not actually

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,360
the smartest move for me I should find

00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:39,540
something stable and just do something

00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,190
boring for two years but talking about

00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:42,660
something borings not going to fly at a

00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:45,750
conference so I've got to find something

00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:47,790
exciting so I've got to be careful that

00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:49,440
I actually make sure I continue to make

00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:51,120
the right calls where I work and I'm not

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,830
just picking some shiny technology

00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:57,150
because it will get me on the stage next

00:51:52,830 --> 00:52:00,870
year and that can be hard yeah so once

00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:04,250
you add something here first of all is

00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:07,050
that you just like the open source

00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:10,500
contributing you should all not give up

00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:13,380
at all but go and go and send the

00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:16,620
proposal stri out like everything you

00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,970
want to do and and you will get on the

00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:21,270
stage at some point if you have

00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:23,480
something that's interesting and I for

00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:29,280
example I sent I think 20 different

00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:32,460
proposals last year and I only got like

00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:35,790
two the reactive con fear and then still

00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:38,220
be fine by it because yeah I try on and

00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:39,810
it's I'm happy if I can on speaker at

00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:44,610
the conference but it's also fine to not

00:52:39,810 --> 00:52:47,520
go there and about it the content of the

00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:50,220
talk I guess you have to be aware that

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:52,560
you're probably not going to attract

00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:54,660
anyone in the audience there will also

00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:57,120
be people who completely disagree with

00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,310
what you're telling and then there's

00:52:57,120 --> 00:53:00,620
this imposter syndrome which is making

00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:03,380
you feel like you know

00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:06,350
thing and this is especially true like

00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:08,000
one or two days before your talk but

00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:11,060
then you have to keep in mind if you're

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,250
presenting something that you were using

00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:15,380
and exploring with your team or your

00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,680
your pro check that your work it's

00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:20,540
probably something that more people

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,190
suffer from than just you and so it

00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:26,120
might be interesting to present it to

00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:29,840
people and then the last thing I can say

00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:34,240
is even if it looks like people up on

00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:38,930
stage are super kind of professional not

00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:41,390
super relaxed and anything at all it's

00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:43,880
kind of only pretending to be i've been

00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:48,260
tracking my heart rate during my talk on

00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:52,340
Monday it was average 150 and to end up

00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:55,250
and up to 170 so yeah you're Cana your

00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:57,200
body is like completely stressed out but

00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:59,630
it's I think that's a good point because

00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,370
you got adrenaline and you feel more

00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:05,650
excited about what you're talking and

00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:08,780
that's kind of normal I guess I hope

00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:11,750
nice so since we're running out of time

00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:17,290
I want to ask two questions everyone

00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:20,150
have to ask a to answer and with just

00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:22,340
like very quickly so the question is

00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:25,010
about two questions because that one

00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:29,060
surface planetary code or good comments

00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:31,640
I think it's nice too so I want to ask

00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:33,170
you when did you modify your slides for

00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:37,340
the last time before you give in your

00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:40,610
talk in my case it was like five minutes

00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:42,770
something like that and I think that

00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:45,110
good comments are self

00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:49,450
explanatory code this way better always

00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:51,800
so I literally just say the same thing

00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:54,500
not five minutes I'm not that

00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,570
bleeding-edge but yeah I was definitely

00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:58,280
fixing my slides in the morning because

00:54:56,570 --> 00:55:00,410
on Monday morning I came to do a tech

00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:02,000
check and I was told that my talk is 25

00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:03,650
minutes and not 40 as I originally

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,230
thought so it's literally redoing my

00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:09,020
talk two hours before my talk because I

00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:11,600
just got confused and yeah definitely

00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:13,940
self explanatory code I don't really

00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:15,619
know of any place where good comments

00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,720
good apart from where there was really

00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:19,220
weird business case and you need to

00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,619
write like so that person told me that

00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:27,260
this weird thing needs to happen

00:55:20,619 --> 00:55:29,089
otherwise just good code I think with my

00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:31,430
talk this time the last I changed my

00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:33,200
slides was maybe the night before like

00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:35,300
right before bed I did a trial run and I

00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,880
tweaked it I mean that it's funny like

00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:40,940
when I was early on in my in speaking I

00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,109
I had this almost snobbish idea of like

00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:43,760
oh if you're if you're at a conference

00:55:42,109 --> 00:55:45,349
in you're tweaking your slides how

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,619
unprofessional is that because your talk

00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:50,119
not finished now that I've spoken a bit

00:55:48,619 --> 00:55:51,890
more I completely understand why and

00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:53,420
it's because a talk is actually never

00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,460
finished

00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:58,220
you could you could forever just keep

00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:00,140
tweaking it and it's just that drive to

00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,790
just make it better and as long as you

00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,170
have more time you'll keep trying to

00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:05,150
make it better and if you give the same

00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:07,210
talk again you'll again you have another

00:56:05,150 --> 00:56:10,099
opportunity to make it slightly better

00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:11,990
so it's just a natural thing it's not

00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:15,410
necessarily that we're procrastinating

00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:16,940
although that does happen and as far as

00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:19,940
the self explanatory code or good

00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,500
comments actually similar to what I just

00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:24,230
said I think I used to be quite snobbish

00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:27,859
about this as well you know you should

00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:28,849
never write comments I think I've looked

00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:30,050
particularly in the kind of work I've

00:56:28,849 --> 00:56:31,609
been doing recently I've learned how

00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:33,950
wrong that is actually to be honest

00:56:31,609 --> 00:56:35,960
because there's certain classes of code

00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:38,240
where you've got a you should actually

00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,829
have more comments than code a good

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,599
example is if you go look at the the

00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:43,640
create react app code base that's a

00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,550
that's the kind of code base where it's

00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:49,280
full of esoteric like configuring of web

00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:51,680
pack and you there's no way to code that

00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,000
in a good readable self-explanatory way

00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:54,740
you've got to have like a wall of

00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,250
comments like why the hell are you doing

00:56:54,740 --> 00:57:01,430
that and whenever I've added we've got a

00:56:58,250 --> 00:57:03,109
similar tool at seek and whenever I add

00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,700
comments like that to what people love

00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:06,140
it they just absolutely love it because

00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:10,150
they can finally make sense of this

00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:13,700
crazy codebase that's it

00:57:10,150 --> 00:57:15,530
so I also changed my slides the night

00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,359
before but it wasn't a big change it was

00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:20,180
just because I had given the same talk

00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,069
in Verona a few weeks ago and it's still

00:57:20,180 --> 00:57:26,359
my Rach type still said hello Verona

00:57:22,069 --> 00:57:27,190
instead of but in general I so I could

00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:28,780
have

00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,400
quite a bit because hooks were very

00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,109
relevant to my talk and I talked about

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,210
hooks towards the end of my talk and

00:57:32,109 --> 00:57:36,369
then I think there was a couple of

00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:40,690
questions I had it hooks I chose not to

00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:43,420
go into it in part because I didn't want

00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,790
to start talking too in-depth about

00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:49,900
something that was only four days old

00:57:45,790 --> 00:57:51,849
and that I mean to be honest the first I

00:57:49,900 --> 00:57:54,280
I had heard about hooks for about a

00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:58,329
month but I'd saw my first demo at react

00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:01,569
conf on Thursday which is not even a

00:57:58,329 --> 00:58:03,550
week ago so the fact so I didn't I had a

00:58:01,569 --> 00:58:04,930
lot of opinions on it but I don't want

00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,819
it I didn't want to present myself like

00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,810
I was an expert and then like have have

00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:09,400
a bunch of stuff up there so that's

00:58:07,810 --> 00:58:11,500
that's basically why I did it although

00:58:09,400 --> 00:58:13,720
it would have been relevant to mine and

00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:14,859
in terms of this last question you

00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,450
should make your code as clear as

00:58:14,859 --> 00:58:19,930
possible so that people could read I

00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:22,960
mean however I don't have an aversion to

00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:24,730
comments I think if in my apps which are

00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,920
product apps if I had a wall of comments

00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:29,140
I'd be unhappy but something like here's

00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,940
what's happening here like one line a

00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:33,339
couple of words that that's that's

00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:35,440
pretty nice I think an open source code

00:58:33,339 --> 00:58:37,810
it's particularly nice to have a lot of

00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:39,609
comments create exact react app is a

00:58:37,810 --> 00:58:41,560
fantastic example and in general your

00:58:39,609 --> 00:58:42,700
web pack is a great example of a place

00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,460
where there should be a lot of comments

00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:47,020
because I mean if you if you guys are

00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:48,430
anything like me you touch web pack once

00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:50,230
every four months or something like that

00:58:48,430 --> 00:58:51,849
and then you go back in your and you're

00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:54,490
like oh I forget how this thing works

00:58:51,849 --> 00:58:57,280
and there's all this it's not like it

00:58:54,490 --> 00:59:01,150
doesn't read like a normal thing so it's

00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,680
a good place to have some comments yeah

00:59:01,150 --> 00:59:05,170
so he's speaking about his slides I

00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:08,230
think the last time I changed a slide

00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:11,470
was on Sunday and I'll I'm tweaking like

00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:15,190
the presenter notes to add some notes

00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:17,890
for myself like all the time but I was

00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:21,339
especially heavily changing the slights

00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:24,849
of four days ago where kind of threw all

00:59:21,339 --> 00:59:26,890
my slides away and did them again yeah I

00:59:24,849 --> 00:59:30,780
kind of went through this process three

00:59:26,890 --> 00:59:34,690
or four times until I finally got there

00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:37,000
yeah but maybe I someday was the last

00:59:34,690 --> 00:59:40,300
real change to the actual talk because

00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,930
at some point you have to just stop and

00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,670
use

00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:44,890
the version you've got now because he

00:59:42,670 --> 00:59:47,589
will always have something to change

00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:50,019
later have you guys ever screwed up

00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:51,430
changing your slides because that

00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:54,309
happened to me like I put the wrong

00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:57,700
slide in there and I was like okay you

00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:59,650
know just can't I just that's like a

00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,480
that's like a fear of mine like I know

00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,009
that it's good and I go change at the

01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,470
night before I could screw something up

01:00:03,009 --> 01:00:07,509
yeah to me it make us more than changing

01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:10,089
the slide itself was changing the notes

01:00:07,509 --> 01:00:12,279
so I was like at some point I didn't

01:00:10,089 --> 01:00:14,589
remember exactly what I put in the notes

01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:17,589
so I was like kind of reading for a

01:00:14,589 --> 01:00:20,259
second but I since it was last moment I

01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:25,200
didn't remember that I put it there I'm

01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:31,779
like locked for a second like next slide

01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:34,690
I don't touch that slides because I have

01:00:31,779 --> 01:00:36,549
special process to creating slides if I

01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:40,779
know I will have to talk about something

01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:44,410
I have just some notes and dump my

01:00:40,779 --> 01:00:46,960
thoughts on the one paper and day before

01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:48,759
the talk and I just put some order in

01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:52,660
that and that's all and I didn't touch

01:00:48,759 --> 01:00:55,299
did I because the arranging comes from

01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:59,279
the you know you're nervous not sure

01:00:55,299 --> 01:01:02,019
about what you are talking about but I

01:00:59,279 --> 01:01:02,890
give so many talks I don't care about

01:01:02,019 --> 01:01:06,130
that anymore

01:01:02,890 --> 01:01:08,079
just doesn't matter the message must be

01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:14,289
rather than the messages generally quite

01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:17,950
simple so on and so that's it I guess so

01:01:14,289 --> 01:01:22,690
yeah thank you for coming for those

01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:25,509
inspirational stories I hope you learned

01:01:22,690 --> 01:01:28,960
some new insights and run some got some

01:01:25,509 --> 01:01:31,269
inspiration in general and also I think

01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:33,609
all of us will be there at the

01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:35,710
after-party later on so if there's

01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:38,650
anything not answered here are you

01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:41,140
something you want to know feel free to

01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:43,180
approach us and basically I guess every

01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:50,380
speaker is around there just go and ask

01:01:43,180 --> 01:01:51,720
him and yeah we also got asked to what's

01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:55,500
it

01:01:51,720 --> 01:01:57,660
yeah we got asked to finish this the

01:01:55,500 --> 01:02:02,240
conference because this was basically

01:01:57,660 --> 01:02:13,859
the last official events happening here

01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:16,109
yeah and we just want to go back yeah we

01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:19,470
want to thank all of you for coming to

01:02:16,109 --> 01:02:22,829
this conference for enjoying those three

01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:24,810
days with us I had a lot of fun here I

01:02:22,829 --> 01:02:27,060
think we all had a lot of fun here we

01:02:24,810 --> 01:02:30,540
hope you had a lot of fun too

01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:33,359
just great to be part of this community

01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:37,440
yeah and thank you for coming this year

01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:42,510
hopefully we'll see all of you next year

01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:46,140
as well also special thanks to Microsoft

01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:49,109
for having us here today for the

01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:51,450
festival day I really enjoyed this this

01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:53,910
whole building I guess you do too we had

01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:57,660
food we had B we had everything it was

01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:59,490
super cool here and of course the most

01:02:57,660 --> 01:03:03,230
important thing is there will be another

01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:06,390
party later at 6:00 6:00 p.m. or they M

01:03:03,230 --> 01:03:10,680
and it will happen here in this very

01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:13,369
same venue and we hope we will all have

01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:16,680
this one last after-party with you

01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:20,250
second floor yeah oh yeah of course it's
