okay so welcome welcome to this ask me

00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,650
anything session here at the discovery

00:00:19,599 --> 00:00:27,250
stage and we have Brian and Phillip here

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:29,890
to talk and answer some of the questions

00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:32,290
that happen during the day of course you

00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:36,370
can join if you happen to have any

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:38,079
questions you can use as little as we

00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:41,230
have used through the conference or you

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:44,379
can also raise your hand and I'll ignore

00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:47,620
you now I'm gonna I'm gonna take your

00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:48,850
questions and yeah we'll find out if we

00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:52,870
know an answer for that

00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:57,070
so um you want to do a little intro sure

00:00:52,870 --> 00:01:04,089
cool Phillip I think we have a trouble

00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:05,740
with a microphone okay hey my name is

00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:09,150
Phillip I'm a developer advocate for

00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,070
flutter and Google in California and I

00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:16,560
was giving a talk with Brian about

00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:26,229
Eric's practical Eric's in flutter and

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:28,360
galets voted my name is Brian Deegan I'm

00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:31,390
an independent developer living in

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,830
Berlin right now and I work on our X

00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,350
star which is the reactive extensions

00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:37,450
for Dart and so yeah our talk was kind

00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:39,280
of combining flutter from Google and

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:44,350
some of these reactive extensions types

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,299
of things together so yep awesome thanks

00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,200
thank you for that so let's take the

00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:50,470
first question

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:54,299
and how does flutter with Eric start

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:58,000
compared to react native with Eric GS or

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,850
Redux observable why not use one code

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:06,909
base for both and also for a smartphone

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,240
app or either both of them yeah I'll

00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:12,060
take it

00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:15,400
yeah yeah so the differential in

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,870
differentiating factor of flutter as I

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,959
said it at all

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:23,140
is that flutter compiles to like native

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,799
code and by native I mean actual machine

00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:31,480
instructions so arm code which means

00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:35,200
that it we're trying to enable really

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,620
kind of smooth AOCI compiled apps that

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,140
are very custom well the other thing is

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,900
it's not just compiled to native arm

00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:47,049
code it's also it has direct access to

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,200
OpenGL so like you can do anything you

00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:52,120
don't need to build the UI using the

00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,629
native which is you actually can't you

00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,750
you have to do everything or flood does

00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:00,910
everything from scratch and this is

00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:03,519
enabling the kinds of apps that we are

00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:06,310
seeing at the top of the lists an app

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,379
store and Play Store where no longer do

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,780
you get these like cookie cutter apps

00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:13,390
and it's that you have these very very

00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:16,120
branded experiences like for example if

00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:19,030
you look at like the uber app the you

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,310
were app on the App Store doesn't look

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,310
like an iOS app it looks like uber app

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:26,349
and it's very similar to the same app on

00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,849
the Play Store right you have the

00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:29,680
physics are a little different there

00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:35,739
there are maybe a little different fonts

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:38,139
but but like the the main UI is like

00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:41,260
it's it's you uber and not something

00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:44,470
else right that is similar to what

00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,280
happened to the web if you think about

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,840
the web like 15 years ago if you came to

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,510
a web page and there was a button there

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,629
the button was actually rendered by the

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,180
system right so it was like a Mac OS

00:03:55,629 --> 00:04:00,760
button on Mac OS and it was a Windows

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,220
button on Windows today if you go to a

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,220
website you almost never see that you

00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:08,139
always see very custom branded button

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,680
that is like you know that that's like

00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:15,849
websites button so we see that and we

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,530
want to enable that and so like we react

00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:20,410
native is it's a different story right

00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:23,440
it still uses the platform views and it

00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,560
has a bridge and like you know JIT

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,820
compiler and all that and

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,830
that's something that enables a

00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,990
different experience which is also

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,340
really great and it's it's but it's

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,790
something else than what we are trying

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,900
to do yeah and I think the second part

00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,370
of the question might have to do with

00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,320
code sharing right you're asking

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,910
well now you're gonna write like your

00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,560
web app and JavaScript and you're gonna

00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,510
write your mobile app and flutter and

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,820
like now you've got two code bases to

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:53,880
manage and actually that's not quite

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,820
true and so what you can do is you can

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,500
actually use layering right and so what

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,350
you can do is you can treat flutter as a

00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:03,990
view layer and you can use other

00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:06,360
libraries as well so like angular Dart

00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:08,460
there's an angular package for Dart and

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,770
what you can do is you can write all of

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,540
your common business logic and all of

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:15,180
your database access these types of

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,070
things you can enable or work with all

00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,690
of these and kind of put them in their

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:20,490
own layers right so you might have your

00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,040
business logic layer and your data layer

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:25,350
and then basically when you want to

00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,790
share that code it becomes really easy

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:28,350
because it's all pure Dart

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,180
so you can actually end up getting

00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:32,250
really high code sharing between an

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,450
angular dart or an angular web

00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,240
application if you don't want to use

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:38,640
angular Dart and you can actually share

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,530
I think somewhere between 50 and 65

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:42,360
percent of code between those two

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,340
applications from from real world

00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,229
examples according to the adds words

00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,450
team and another company called

00:05:46,229 --> 00:05:51,450
app tree who do exactly this technique

00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,310
so yeah so you shouldn't think that if

00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,250
you go with flutter you can't reuse code

00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,720
you totally can yeah and that's yeah I

00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,100
want to underline that this is not like

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,729
a theoretical thing this is actually

00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,490
what like the Edwards app which is the

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:09,090
main like source of income for Google is

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:11,460
build with so they have web web compact

00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:13,410
they have a website or web app and they

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,120
have iOS and Android apps and they're

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,300
sharing code through our ranks

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:21,960
I think that that gives a really nice

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,780
developer experience overall yeah okay

00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,470
so next question what is the most

00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,350
popular

00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,479
Flattr app built by Google in your in

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:32,370
your opinion so if we're talking about

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,020
popularity in terms of numbers right now

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,180
that's the AdWords set like that's

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,110
millions of people who are kind of

00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,120
trying to give us money so

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:44,180
we're kind of excited about that there

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,580
are this I cannot understand that this

00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,020
is not like the kind of sexiest kind of

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,759
app that is out there

00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,310
I was really important for Google and

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,129
I'm glad that this is exactly the kind

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:57,949
of apps that we're building because yeah

00:06:55,129 --> 00:07:00,710
I mean that kind of gives you an idea of

00:06:57,949 --> 00:07:04,520
how important that is for Google that

00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:06,050
said we have a pipeline of apps that are

00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,690
in footer that will be released later

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,500
and that are the more like sexy kind of

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:16,789
part but not yet okay okay

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:20,180
all good let's see we have one question

00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:22,819
here from the audience now that we had a

00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,370
little bit of conversation No

00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,500
okay I'll take the next question how

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:32,599
much of a codebase can you share between

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,949
iOS and Android in flatter yeah so once

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:36,080
again I think what you've seen from

00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:39,020
real-world large-scale applications from

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,969
AdWords to other companies like app tree

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,740
who are doing this exact pattern like I

00:07:40,969 --> 00:07:44,120
said it depends on the approach they

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:48,680
take but it's the reports have been

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,110
between 50 and 65 percent of course oh I

00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:53,840
think you're talking about iOS Android

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,069
web o Oh iOS and Android I'm sorry oh my

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,800
gosh yeah I totally misunderstood that

00:07:55,069 --> 00:08:00,800
then at that point after he said about

00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:03,440
95% of their code so they probably have

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,229
a very custom UI and once again this is

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,240
what is really nice about flutter and so

00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:10,310
you know you could think about like

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,169
showing an iOS button on the iOS

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,419
platform and like an Android material

00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,949
style button on the Android platform but

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,629
because I think they use a fairly custom

00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:21,139
UI they've said that they've been able

00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:22,219
to share 90 to 95% of their code so yeah

00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,379
so you're gonna be able to reuse a

00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:26,180
majority of your code between iOS and

00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:29,840
Android as well that really comes from

00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:32,270
the again from the architectural choice

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,849
of flutter of like owning every pixel

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:37,159
and so therefore like if you if you want

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,159
an app that looks exactly the same for

00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:43,070
iOS and Android and just things like

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,740
scrolling behavior and you know like

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:48,199
phones obviously are different then

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:50,810
that's 100% because you really don't

00:08:48,199 --> 00:08:52,470
like do anything else right and and so

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,870
many apps that you'll see

00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,840
like sample apps from you or from us

00:08:54,870 --> 00:09:00,840
will just be that one thing and there's

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,690
no like if/else anywhere except very

00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,370
deep in the in that framework yeah and I

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,020
also like to quickly note as well as

00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,510
like there are Android developers in the

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,070
room you might know like how difficult

00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,350
it is to support older versions of

00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:15,360
Android as well and this is actually one

00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,610
area where flutter really shines so if

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,250
you put a button on screen it will look

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,420
the same on all platforms so you might

00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:23,040
not have this like really weird

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,750
experience on for point X where you're

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,340
like missing drop shadows and like

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,620
certain animations aren't working or

00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:30,120
having to spend a lot of time getting

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,530
those things working for older versions

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,170
of Android which are still very popular

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,270
in developing countries as well right

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,100
I'm sorry I just won't do because

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,110
nobody's asking about this as far as I

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,350
know there's also a downside to this

00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:45,390
right so we have we have basically a

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,840
canvas and you're like letting right in

00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:52,140
onto the canvas OpenGL on Vulcan that

00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:54,930
means that it's basically like you

00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,670
cannot use native views right so so if

00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,920
you have a library somewhere with like a

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,930
button that you like for Android you

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,670
cannot use that because you will have to

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,290
recreate that what we see is that it's

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,750
actually pretty easy to recreate that it

00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:08,850
further but like if you really depend on

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,490
that then you're screwed with butter so

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:15,300
so far again is very much geared to the

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:19,260
very custom experiences and it doesn't

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,350
if you know for example if if I I had

00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,600
that kind of problem of of using many

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:30,450
native use I wouldn't recommend flour at

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:35,610
all I was thinking of a question of my

00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:38,730
own and I was thinking in in a lot of a

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,820
scenarios we can see that keeping with

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:45,390
the new versions of Android and for some

00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:48,120
for some providers folk providers

00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:50,580
there's some delay when they can

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,350
actually release on the new phones and

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:59,100
how is that in your experience on iOS

00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:01,440
because I also I also remember that iOS

00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,570
sometimes can be a little bit not so

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,700
open I mean

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:07,670
on the site of Android I can see that

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:10,640
that could be smooth going forward but

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:13,010
maybe iOS will put some you know kind of

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,720
roadblock so maybe not what make it that

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:21,410
easy right

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:23,720
so what yes so for example for I like to

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:26,360
start with like the backwards

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:28,520
compatibility right so so because we

00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,710
like kind of if you use quarter you own

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:33,290
all the pixels and we give you kind of

00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,060
material design all that stuff you can

00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:38,450
actually have like a material design app

00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:40,310
on a phone that came out way before

00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:45,170
there was material design like in like

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:47,180
2012 and and that's again it's because

00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:49,130
of the architecture that doesn't mean

00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,620
that again like you you might not want

00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:56,480
that you might want for some reason to

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,040
like to keep the old style but again if

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,990
you have a custom design you probably

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:02,960
don't want join you want things to look

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,840
similar everywhere for the second part

00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,050
of the question about like you know iOS

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:12,100
then we've seen that it's again like

00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:14,690
whatever you ship it's going to be that

00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:18,080
that's gonna be your party like you know

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:21,170
you're not asking I Oh s like please

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:23,270
render this button and then in on

00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,330
platform apps that would mean like oh

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm actually a newer version of you know

00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,620
iOS so I will render this kind of button

00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,800
this is like something else

00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:35,810
and in this case flutter will just like

00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:40,040
render the button that it's ships with

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:42,650
and that again is if you're trying to

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,560
build an app that looks really kind of

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:48,020
cookie cutter like iOS then that's going

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:51,020
to be always the same until you update

00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,330
the app which i think is a strong point

00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:57,590
but again like if it's only for the apps

00:12:53,330 --> 00:13:01,520
that are custom built III get it now so

00:12:57,590 --> 00:13:03,890
you take charge of these and then moving

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,890
forward you can be assured that that

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:09,770
won't be affected by any by any of them

00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:12,200
yes future update which is which is kind

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,310
of a strong and also going backwards I

00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,360
mean that's that's awesome

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:16,459
yeah I

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,709
and yeah and so and but obviously that

00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:21,559
doesn't solve the issue of like if if

00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:24,649
for example if i OS comes with an arch

00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:27,769
right or they did so so you have an arch

00:13:24,649 --> 00:13:29,059
now you have to deal with an arch and we

00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:30,589
were we've seen we were actually

00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:32,600
prepared for the note before the nod

00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:36,379
came out because it was it's it's

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,139
something that thankfully apple tells

00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:41,779
people about and then they release the

00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:44,089
xcode and all these things that that

00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:47,569
enable it for iOS development but you

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:49,790
can prepare again if you if you own the

00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:52,339
whole canvas you can prepare for that

00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:54,410
before so we have for example we have a

00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:57,049
widget called safe area which is like

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,480
you just put safe area somewhere and it

00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:02,779
and it knows that it like if there's an

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:05,420
arch it will be below the notch so you

00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:07,279
know that this area will like be

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:10,549
readable for example and it's not going

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:13,910
to be covered understood okay so let's

00:14:10,549 --> 00:14:18,850
take another question is it possible to

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:22,220
use okay that was that was a big change

00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:24,169
okay let's take this new one what kind

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:26,569
of app performance can we expect from

00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:30,139
flatter compared to react native for

00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:32,959
example or others if you have numbers i

00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:34,999
mean you got a benchmark everything you

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,449
know flutters just faster don't worry

00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:38,360
about it

00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:40,069
don't compare it um you know I mean with

00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,509
everything I think so you have some

00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:44,989
interesting advantages Lutter

00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:47,629
where you actually like for example at

00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:49,549
SoundCloud we had a react native app and

00:14:47,629 --> 00:14:51,439
one thing that you generally suffer is

00:14:49,549 --> 00:14:53,299
from like a startup time right you have

00:14:51,439 --> 00:14:55,279
to start up the VM your phone has to

00:14:53,299 --> 00:14:57,350
interpret the code and this is something

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,839
even Airbnb talked about in their series

00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:02,119
about removing react native from their

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,009
apps so this is an interesting thing

00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:06,470
because like I said you you're involving

00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:08,360
a JavaScript interpreter and one nice

00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:09,949
thing is because flutter when you're in

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,110
development mode it actually uses an

00:15:09,949 --> 00:15:13,999
interpreter and a just-in-time compiler

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:15,709
but as Phillip was saying when you're

00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:17,419
ready to go to production mode it will

00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,179
compile that down to native machine code

00:15:17,419 --> 00:15:21,799
so what I've seen is I've seen much

00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:24,019
faster startup times on the app I've

00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,269
built and as far as building really

00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:27,080
custom animations like it's just really

00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:30,740
smooth and really

00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:33,740
fast and now of course you know these

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,750
are optimized OpenGL instructions and so

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:38,030
sometimes if you've got a phone that has

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,740
maybe a less common GPU for example you

00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,140
might see some really bad performance

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:43,760
but that's that's a really good test

00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,990
case to just submit a bug and let the

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,480
flutter team know like hey for some

00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:49,220
reason on my one plus six or something

00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,210
I'm getting really bad animations here

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:54,800
and then they can optimize so yeah I

00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:56,510
mean I think it's like I said it's

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,430
always really hard to perform or to

00:15:56,510 --> 00:16:00,410
think about performance between two

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,410
things without having a really good fair

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,510
test case but I would say overall I've

00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:08,450
been impressed by the speed of flutter

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:10,400
as a user essentially and for me as a

00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:13,790
subjective I've felt it's faster than

00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,610
react native but yeah measure first then

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,160
then talk slow

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:23,050
actually thanks thanks for the answer I

00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:26,780
I was thinking about because it's quite

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:30,500
neo approach of all these you know this

00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:33,470
area what are the reactions from native

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,920
developers when the experience you know

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:39,620
flattered and what are the feedback what

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,710
is the feedback from you know both maybe

00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:44,270
iOS developers and Android developers

00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,880
yeah I think I think there's definitely

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:48,740
skepticism because we've seen all these

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,230
like like you know if you just if you

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,110
say cross-platform development that's

00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:56,810
like everyone's just running away and

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,090
that's because oftentimes the crosswalk

00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:00,410
fulness and the developer experience and

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:02,810
I came first and then the user

00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,270
experience was like yeah well you know

00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:07,100
they only deal with that and so I think

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,900
what's new about foreign debt that's why

00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:11,180
we always talk about them kind of

00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,820
compilation to machine code is that you

00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:17,330
can have in if you have something like

00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:19,550
this that compatible with chip and äôt

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,260
you can have a good developer experience

00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:23,060
with like a hot reload and all this but

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,610
you can also have a really good user

00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,890
experience because it's fast right you

00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,050
can definitely ask to to come to the

00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:33,290
neck previous question you can have a

00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:37,260
shitty flora app that's slow like that's

00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:39,419
you know that's no problem but

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,480
it's it's kind of you know we tried to

00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:44,909
make it really hard and yeah well I I

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,649
was recently talking with them with some

00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:52,919
people from the flutter team it was at

00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:55,350
droidcon London now and they one of the

00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,510
things that they point to me is you know

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,940
the development cycle was like super

00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:02,370
fast and that was one of the main like

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,470
wow it was you know you had the new

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:06,120
version you did a change and then you

00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,220
you could see like what would be the

00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,000
change you know on the app like really

00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,700
really fast

00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,279
yeah is that is that something that who

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:17,130
is who is more happy about this like I

00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:19,799
always developers because yeah like I

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:22,169
mean both I was an Android like they you

00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,880
know take a long time to compile and so

00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,500
stay cool hot real oh this is what

00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,299
you're talking about it like you can be

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,669
in any screen inside your app and you

00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:32,309
can change something and just punch all

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:33,240
safe and it will like reload in under

00:18:32,309 --> 00:18:35,580
right I don't know five hundred

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,220
milliseconds so that really changes the

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,990
way you you're building apps but for

00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,389
example I we weren't talking about this

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:44,519
in out all because I think like if you

00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:46,700
choose again if you choose the

00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:49,409
development your development environment

00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:53,279
just because of a development experience

00:18:49,409 --> 00:18:56,429
then it's just you know come on so it's

00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,470
your building apps for users so totally

00:18:56,429 --> 00:19:00,510
totally yeah I mean that's a shiny

00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:02,070
that's a sign of it it is it is yeah

00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,630
yeah I mean I basically bailed on

00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:06,029
Android as soon as I had hot reload

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,039
again so yeah I mean maybe just more of

00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:10,980
a subjective thing but yeah I kind of

00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,720
came from the web and design world then

00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,120
I moved into Android for five or so

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,700
years and when I found flutter I was

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,580
like yes I get my like I get my fast hot

00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,350
reloads back and you know I think things

00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,179
like the demo we did today like there's

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,620
no way we could have done that on native

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,669
Android it would've been like alright so

00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,649
we're just gonna like wait for two

00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:32,580
minutes while this recompile so you know

00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:35,460
and for me I think you you like make a

00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,809
really good point which is like I you

00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,610
know when I first tried flutter is still

00:19:36,809 --> 00:19:40,230
you know you had some jank and like some

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,120
of the animations weren't smooth but

00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:44,399
like it was clear that it was gonna get

00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,590
there from a developer experience from a

00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:49,080
design and user experience and then from

00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:50,100
a developer experience it was just it

00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,170
was such a breath of fresh

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,580
err when I you know especially like I

00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,960
said having a design background and

00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,880
wanting to make changes and like just

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,290
add some drop shadows and I know this

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,870
sounds ridiculous but sometimes this can

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,690
be really difficult on Android so I was

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,120
I was super happy to to jump jump into

00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:07,020
flutter for sure yeah yeah I figured

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,080
okay

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:11,640
so let's take some for some more

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,580
questions here what would be a

00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,690
JavaScript alternative to the switch map

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:22,110
I mean this is completely yeah so you

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:24,240
would have rxjs or extreme there are a

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:27,210
few different Kaffir bacon there's like

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,700
quite a few reaiiy reactive like stream

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:31,350
libraries for javascript and almost all

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,710
of them should have something like

00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:38,100
switch map for sure rxjs has switch map

00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,350
directly and you might also see it named

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,670
things like flat map latest or it might

00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:43,650
have a slightly different name but this

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:45,600
is a really common operator so you'll

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:51,690
almost get it with most of those those

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:55,880
types of packages cool we get any

00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:55,880
questions from from you cool

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,950
[Music]

00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,480
so we have to to Leah okay so to repeat

00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:25,160
the question I'm really bad at repeating

00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,490
questions but but it's like well how

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:33,460
does for tooling compare to react native

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:37,150
cook tooling so flora has supposed to

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,410
like to basically further supports

00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,480
different ways of building your app

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:45,320
including just like you know editor like

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,250
theme and whatever but like the the most

00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,940
well supported is Visual Studio code or

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:54,230
IntelliJ anything in IntelliJ and in

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,260
Visual Studio code I think it's a really

00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:00,710
good one would I use as you saw maybe

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:03,800
today I use IntelliJ or Android studio

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:08,690
and which is the same thing and and they

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:11,180
had we have flutter inspector which I

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,070
didn't show but you basically can just

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:16,760
like inspect everything it's it's

00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,620
borrowing a lot from the web tooling so

00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,750
so you actually can like click on

00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:22,340
something on the screen and it will show

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,170
you exactly what it is and you can

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,310
change things in yeah and it's awesome

00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:27,770
actually one of my favorite things about

00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:29,270
this as well is once you like select an

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,620
element you can even like double click

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,420
on it and it'll take your editors

00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:34,490
straight to that part in your code as

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:36,980
well so especially if you're like coming

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,940
on to an app so I joined like a company

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,770
that was building an app and I was

00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,910
helping them build it out as well and I

00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,470
was just trying to get familiar with it

00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,870
and so it was so cool I could just like

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:46,340
tap on this thing and and go directly to

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:48,410
that part in my code base so you're not

00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,870
like searching around like alright is

00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,340
this like search to screen dart or

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,750
anything and you're just like you can

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:57,020
really get to the code points you worry

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:59,750
about really well yeah this is a this is

00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:02,270
a similar similar question around this

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,910
topic so is it easy to configure flat

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:08,700
into a visual code or webstorm

00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:12,210
or is really recommended another tool i

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:14,010
Android studio yeah it's funny so yeah

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,410
it's definitely easy to so envious code

00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,040
you just go install packages and use you

00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:22,200
like install flutter and it will do

00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,820
everything like in in a few seconds it's

00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,050
it's called dart code if you're

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,440
interested in there hackett well I mean

00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:31,680
so you can actually install flutter and

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:34,580
it will automatically install that movie

00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:37,590
it does that now how interesting so and

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,690
for for Android studio I'm I know that

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:42,150
Android studio and IntelliJ community

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,740
and you know that is the other one that

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:45,510
not the community one the vendor price

00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,760
or whatever they call it that's

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:50,400
definitely supported webstorm I actually

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,140
use for even for further development but

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,860
I'm not sure how much that support it

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,470
because I know that the IntelliJ

00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:00,540
different versions of the IntelliJ IDE S

00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,220
even though it seems like they should be

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:04,590
like super compatible sometimes they're

00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:07,320
not so so you can try it and you'll

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:10,860
probably be fine but like if you want to

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:14,700
have that like you know if you want to

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:19,800
be sure go with either PS code or a new

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,540
studio or IntelliJ community or the yeah

00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:23,520
so you will get all this set up like

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:24,960
really really nice yeah and I actually

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,430
think it might not work in webstorm

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,290
anymore because I used to be my primary

00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,880
editor and I think they have some weird

00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:31,560
restrictions on Java I don't know it's

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,090
like IntelliJ they try to push it

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:38,130
towards their Oldtown product so I think

00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:40,380
they've yeah not removed okay let's see

00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:43,200
the next question can we spec any kind

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,350
of road blocks similar to what we were

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,590
talking before from Apple if we want to

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:52,080
release flatter apps to the App Store's

00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:55,140
any yeah I I can't talk to you know poor

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,510
Apple but one way to think about it is

00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:59,520
well first of all the the app that I

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,410
show today like the screenshot with the

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,180
reflector app was actually featured on

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,130
the App Store so that that tells you

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,390
something it's not like they like look

00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,450
at this and they are now its father oh

00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:11,790
we're not gonna feature it or so there's

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,620
definitely many apps today like Hamilton

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,270
app and and stuff like this that's on

00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:18,180
the App Store and they are they have

00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,950
like millions of downloads so that's

00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:23,179
that's

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,399
that's great one way to think about this

00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:27,859
is basically flutter is like unity

00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:30,369
butter for apps right so that it's the

00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:34,820
same model like your your shipping

00:25:30,369 --> 00:25:37,149
binaries so to me it's almost like if

00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:40,429
like Apple says like you know flower is

00:25:37,149 --> 00:25:42,019
reportin then they have to say unit is

00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,480
for Bowden and that I don't think that

00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:49,399
it's gonna happen but again I'm not an

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,980
apple spokesperson so yeah well we'll

00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:56,809
take the last question and then we can

00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:58,700
wrap up so how about device sensors do

00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:01,429
all of them run smoothly with all

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:04,330
Android and iOS versions or there's any

00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:07,039
small differences when using a flatter

00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:09,289
yeah so probably similar to react native

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,519
essentially you build these these

00:26:09,289 --> 00:26:13,070
plugins that talk to the native

00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:14,330
platforms and send the data back and so

00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:16,460
usually what you would do is you would

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,940
wrap up the platform differences a lot

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:22,029
of times in a kind of a common API so if

00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:24,169
you're working with like geolocation or

00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:25,429
microphones or cameras and things like

00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:27,379
that you generally have a single

00:26:25,429 --> 00:26:30,769
interface and it'll work for both

00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:32,720
platforms I think this is like you know

00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:33,889
I'm not here just to like totally say

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,210
flutter is awesome I do think this is

00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:37,820
one area where flutter could use some

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,559
improvement actually is yeah I think

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,629
there's a few different plugins for like

00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:44,450
geolocation but when I used it I had to

00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:47,090
like go in and modify the Android code

00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:50,179
and God forbid I did some iOS as well

00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:52,039
but yeah and so you know I think this is

00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:53,330
like there's for the most part really

00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,070
good story for a lot of these but it's

00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:56,869
still because flutter is in beta or I

00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,450
guess release candidate they're still I

00:26:56,869 --> 00:27:01,759
think some of these packages could be a

00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:05,230
little more refined over time yeah we do

00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:08,929
have a we do have a package ecosystem

00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:12,220
that has all these plugins and so we're

00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:15,590
actually now because we're you know

00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:17,899
approaching 1.0 we're trying to own some

00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:21,289
of these plugins so that we know that

00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:23,869
these are you know at least GPS and like

00:27:21,289 --> 00:27:26,779
go tooth and stuff like this is actually

00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:29,239
you know good quality and yeah and

00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:32,180
obviously if you if you don't if you

00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:34,400
have something like super custom and you

00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,860
find a plug-in that is already existing

00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,470
then there's this like whole plugin

00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:42,500
architecture where you basically you can

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:45,620
write yourself like billion sounds great

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:48,410
well thanks a lot for coming here to the

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:51,410
discovery stage to this ask me anything

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:53,360
session they will be available for their

00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:56,930
you know for a couple of hours that

00:27:53,360 --> 00:28:00,860
maybe stay here otherwise I guess that

00:27:56,930 --> 00:28:04,400
you could use also as Lido and we will

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:08,500
make the questions reach them so thanks

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,930
thanks again for joining the AMA and

00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:15,109
