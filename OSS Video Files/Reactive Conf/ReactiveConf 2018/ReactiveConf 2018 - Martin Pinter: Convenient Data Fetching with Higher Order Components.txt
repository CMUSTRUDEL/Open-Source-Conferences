Convenient Data Fetching with Higher Order Components

While the React community has largely agreed on abstracting complex app state away from the components, it is often a different story when it comes to remote data-fetching. On one side stand the many incarnations of the "fetch on didMount, show placeholder while isLoading" pattern, on the other you have frameworks like Apollo and Falcor - great in their own right, but what if we can't (or even don't want to) use them on a particular project ?
We'll be showing a small and self-contained data provider library - using higher-order React components and Redux on client side, and requiring zero changes to you backend. We'll also keep our components from worrying about how and when the fetching happens - defining instead only what data is required, while abstracting all of the race-conditions and caching via a single HOC, handling the hard parts.
