Typing Towards an Accessible Web

Writing accessible code is hard, but modern web languages can make it easier, and can save developers from mistakes. We can leverage type safety to prevent inaccessible event listeners on divs, we can avoid the dreaded tpyo. In this talk, we'll delve into accessibility on the web, and how type safety on the frontend can guide towards more accessible code.
We'll explore examples using Elm, a functional, type-safe language that compiles to JavaScript, and the Elm package "accessible-html", a helper library encouraging accessible practices. Elm experience is not necessary!
