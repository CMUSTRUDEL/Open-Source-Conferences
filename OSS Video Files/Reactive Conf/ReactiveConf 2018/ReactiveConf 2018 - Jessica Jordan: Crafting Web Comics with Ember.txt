Crafting Web Comics with Ember

Are you a fan of comics or have you ever dreamed of becoming a comic artist yourself? Then this talk is just for you.
In this talk we will see how both recent and matured Web APIs, including CSS3 and the Web Animations API can be leveraged to tell our own, rich and interactive stories on the web. We’ll take a look on how we can use Ember.js to help us create an online comic book that makes any comic art fan’s heart leap for joy.
