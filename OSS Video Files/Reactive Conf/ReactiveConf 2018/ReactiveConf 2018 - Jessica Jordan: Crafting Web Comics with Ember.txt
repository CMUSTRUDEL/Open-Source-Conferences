Crafting Web Comics with Ember

Are you a fan of comics or have you ever dreamed of becoming a comic artist yourself? Then this talk is just for you.
In this talk we will see how both recent and matured Web APIs, including CSS3 and the Web Animations API can be leveraged to tell our own, rich and interactive stories on the web. We’ll take a look on how we can use Ember.js to help us create an online comic book that makes any comic art fan’s heart leap for joy.

[Music]

00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,990
[Applause]

00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:18,710
um yeah hi my name is Jessica and today

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,840
I want to talk to you about web comics

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,640
and specifically I want to share some of

00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,220
the learnings that I had when I started

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,500
to create my own comic on the web

00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,480
because I feel really like an artist at

00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,789
heart and hopefully by the end of the

00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,589
stalk you also have a better idea how

00:00:31,789 --> 00:00:36,460
you can actually get started with your

00:00:33,589 --> 00:00:39,589
own art experiences on the Internet

00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:42,710
and before we get started just like a

00:00:39,589 --> 00:00:45,619
few words about what brings me to this

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,670
topic actually oops yeah you know I

00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:51,769
already gave the joke away when I was

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:53,540
younger probably like many others of

00:00:51,769 --> 00:00:56,989
here in the audience I was a very great

00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:58,670
fan of web comics and in fact awesome

00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:02,119
comics like traditional comics that we

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,010
read in the 90s we're a thing that was

00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,570
very

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:07,189
already kind of like an old concept

00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,900
right like if you think about it like

00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:11,360
even like your parents even your

00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,310
grandparents they used to go to a comic

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,470
book store they used to go to a corner

00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:18,200
shop and they would actually buy any of

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:20,450
these magazines or maybe even like bound

00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,520
books and they would take a tome just

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,500
read it because it's just like a book

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,350
it's like a written book with some

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,890
illustrations and a more immersive and

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:33,560
artful experience than pure prose book

00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:35,720
and I wanted to have a look actually

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,600
like how all this concept is I was

00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,820
thinking first like okay like probably

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,580
comic books like this format of like

00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:45,170
magazines and actually having it like in

00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,659
a printed form it's something that goes

00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,550
back maybe to the 30s or something I was

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,560
thinking okay like US comics like in

00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,590
investing culture this became like

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,600
popular probably in the early 20th

00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,760
century but in fact when I had a look I

00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,729
found out that the earliest remarks of

00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,520
so-called comic books the tellings of

00:02:01,729 --> 00:02:07,190
different historical events using both

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,369
imagery and a little bit of prose dates

00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:13,400
back to the 18th century in Japan where

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,650
the first woodblock print with comic

00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,930
books were actually published to try to

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:20,090
convey stories to more illiterate

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,219
readers and I found this really

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,230
interesting and like in fact yeah sure

00:02:22,219 --> 00:02:25,790
like this image here like with the we

00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,620
the comics and how I actually draw it

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,120
but honestly like for me it looked like

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:31,280
more like this right um

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,110
maybe they're also like other Sailor

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,739
Moon fans here that can really relate

00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:39,140
with this and nowadays I still read

00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:41,360
comic books and a little bit comics and

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,319
comic strips wherever I can go and in

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,959
fact I realized that mmm even if we

00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,660
might not be so super aware of it

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,129
it's like 2018 and a lot of people are

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,230
currently going online already with

00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:56,750
their comics a lot of people that

00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,280
already share their art there and make

00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,750
it like more accessible for us once we

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,049
actually use our browser

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,400
- yeah explore this experiences there

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,079
are a few examples that I really like

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,930
that I want to show here for example I'm

00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:12,019
a really big fan of like Metroid it's

00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:14,870
it's short comic serious of The

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:16,370
Adventures of like yeah I actually don't

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,410
know what animal it is like I think it's

00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,090
like a penguin or something and the

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:22,220
other one it's called like potato

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,410
because like he looks like he's drawn

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,170
like a potato you know so this is like

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:29,359
this identity and it's like really fun

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,430
and very yeah short comic strip that

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,130
just tried to illustrate absurd

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,109
situations for these characters and I

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,669
find really cool and the way that the

00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:40,340
artist does that actually bring it to

00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:42,169
the web they just have a website and the

00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:43,720
ball for example with the graphic tool

00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,790
or maybe like even hand drawn images

00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,470
scan those in or already have a like

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,540
presence on the computer when they use a

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,370
graphic crafter to like sketch for

00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,049
example and they will upload it on a

00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,400
regular schedule to their own website to

00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:58,280
their own portfolio website and

00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,530
therefore you can see they use the web

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,239
as just the transportation medium for

00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,260
the art that they could otherwise also

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,989
have shared like a very traditional

00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:07,790
medium like printed books and another

00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,340
way for a lot of artists to share their

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,379
art is also to use social media for

00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,930
example I'm a big fan of like Ruby TC

00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,940
she she has like very short and very

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,579
point and comic strip about like also

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:21,919
absurd situations and also challenges

00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:24,020
and situations on her Twitter profile

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,190
but also an Instagram and I find it

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,949
really interesting to see that because

00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:32,090
it gives me this idea that the app is a

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:34,099
very cool medium to actually make it

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:36,140
easy for artists to reach a large

00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,060
audience very easily and also for us

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,320
readers to actually explore

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,870
different artists in a very

00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,730
straightforward way on the platform said

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,430
we already used on a regular basis for

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:51,850
ya chatting with other people and also

00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:54,920
explore what's going on in the world and

00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,200
I was thinking okay this sounds really

00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,430
cool so actually a lot of people already

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:02,570
doing that they're already doing online

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,430
comics and maybe this is actually not so

00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:05,900
super difficult maybe maybe I can do

00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,380
something like that to write and

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:12,140
hopefully you also get a better idea and

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,300
this part of the talk how you can try to

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,330
create your own illustrations and bring

00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,130
them online I was thinking for me

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,960
personally I really wanted to have like

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,000
a very traditional comic book experience

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,120
actually I wanted to have like a proper

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,130
book and I was thinking okay like how is

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,050
actually like a comic book compose so

00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:32,000
it's looking at the autonomy of like a

00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,800
comic book what actually makes a comic

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,330
book and how can I use this knowledge

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,370
about life of the structure of a comic

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:39,560
book is to actually create my own online

00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,300
experience of it I was thinking okay

00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,890
like probably a comic book actually

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:45,230
doesn't have so many parts to it it has

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,030
like a lot of pages right so if I want

00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:48,920
to stick to the traditional structure I

00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:50,780
would need like many of those right and

00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,300
like each of these pages is usually

00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:55,490
broken down into like different panels

00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,560
so these are like pieces of continents

00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,270
that actually carry my images and also

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,070
maybe some prose if I want to do that

00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,020
and last but at least of course like I

00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:04,610
actually have to have some content so I

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,520
probably also have to get drawing which

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,280
is kind of the fun part also the very

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,120
laborious part as I found out but very

00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:16,010
cool and then when I am you have further

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,570
looked into it that was like okay like

00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:20,120
let's actually maybe start from the very

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,310
top let's use a top-down approach and

00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:24,830
actually try to create my comic pages

00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,220
that should carry the different panels

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:31,970
yes you already could see in the title

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,370
of this talk I will demonstrate this

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,560
example of my comic experiments and at

00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:37,910
the framework and much yes so I create

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,360
an ember app to actually do that and

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,850
throughout the talk I might name a

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,090
couple of things or try to explain a

00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:49,040
couple of things that I am but specific

00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,510
because the feeling that I got at least

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,740
like from yesterday is like there are a

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,990
lot of people in here the

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,330
actually mostly use direct right like

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,180
maybe I can get a quick show of hands

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:02,180
like who uses react regularly in the day

00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,669
job okay a couple of people use this

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,539
ember regularly in the day job yeah

00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:10,880
there is a person okay cool yeah great

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:13,190
so yeah it's like a like a mixed

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,840
audience but still I want to yea show

00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,060
some of like Emma specific things but

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,639
also hopefully try to explain it in a

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:22,130
way that you can also extrapolate this

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,750
to react of you or angular orally or

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:29,270
whatever you're using exactly so one

00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,699
concept that's interesting an ember but

00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:34,580
I think it's also very well adopted and

00:07:31,699 --> 00:07:37,280
a lot of other frameworks is that a lot

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:40,370
of the asset management happens via URL

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,009
and therefore we have like a nice lever

00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:45,470
for actually making enable for users to

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:48,349
enter so an app state why are they well

00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,110
so for example I was thinking okay like

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:54,560
in ember in my Emma app I actually would

00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,880
like to have like different pages and I

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,289
would call them chapters because I

00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,150
realized okay like actually it's not

00:07:57,289 --> 00:08:01,490
very pages because I'm not really

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:04,250
constrained by it like like the size of

00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:06,770
the page like a chapter can also be some

00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:09,620
kind of like expert relation of this

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,969
page concept and I was thinking it would

00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,190
be cool to have an overview page first

00:08:10,969 --> 00:08:15,500
that you can access my chapters and also

00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,789
I wanted to have a more specific detail

00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,740
view of every page so you can actually

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:21,620
read the comic right so this kind of

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,960
makes sense and an ember once we start

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,610
thinking about what kind of URLs the

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,930
user actually has to access we already

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,960
have a great starting point to build our

00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,029
app because an ember a lot of things I

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,789
would probably say everything starts

00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,919
with the route so we go into our router

00:08:34,789 --> 00:08:40,640
configuration and we will try to create

00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:43,550
this route in our router map config and

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,880
there we they are now create my chapters

00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:49,910
overview and also my detail pages which

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,850
are nested child routes of the chapters

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,620
route and then once I actually have set

00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:57,350
this up I already have different

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,600
websites and can be ended wire specific

00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:01,610
URLs and the great advantage that I get

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,190
from this as well by already starting

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,300
out like that is that once I have

00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,160
created this route

00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,019
I can also make it possible to just like

00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,760
load specifically data for this specific

00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:12,410
route very similar to other routing

00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,990
libraries that you might already use in

00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:17,660
your library or framework of choice and

00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,430
an ember for example I can now use my

00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:21,320
data which already comes with my

00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:23,170
out-of-the-box the data layer for

00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:26,060
actually interacting with my back-end

00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:28,790
and to actually get all the chapters

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,890
that or all the configuration data that

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,820
I need for my specific page and load in

00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:33,950
my application

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,740
it's also worth it to know it why do I

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:38,300
actually do all of this I know that as I

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,110
go on to actually create my comic book

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,250
it will it will very likely scale and

00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:45,490
therefore I created a small back-end

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:48,230
that just carries configuration

00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:51,200
confirmation data for my specific pages

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,089
and also I wanted to make sure that this

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,060
is separated from my actual single page

00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:58,220
application in the front-end so once

00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:59,990
I've done that I'm already good to go

00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:01,310
and can finally do something with the

00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,430
data that I've loaded in my specific

00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:05,779
route I can now also have a look at what

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,100
I actually do with this data and how I

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,860
can convey it and do something

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,570
interesting with it I was thinking okay

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:13,640
like how do you actually comic panels

00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:27,829
work like what do I want to do in my in

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:29,750
my comic book experience actually when

00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:31,790
we look at traditional comics there's

00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,490
something very interesting to note here

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:37,040
right like we might never think about it

00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:38,870
but once we actually have a printed

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,410
comic book there's a very specific way

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,540
how we can try to create storytelling

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:47,600
and how we also can convey this idea of

00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,760
emotion here for example we see a short

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,890
comic strip of Kevin Hart's very popular

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,620
comic series and here can we can for

00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,320
example see Calvin sitting in the first

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,029
panel in a classroom and just like yeah

00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,709
looking as teacher seems to be like a

00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,510
bit upset and going like like do you

00:11:00,709 --> 00:11:05,060
actually pay attention to the lesson and

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,070
then once we move our eyes to the next

00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,180
panel we can see how suddenly the whole

00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,769
environment has changed

00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,990
it seems the comment is suddenly sitting

00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,910
in a spaceship his teacher has become

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:16,190
like an alien or just like a very cute

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,800
monster I don't know and it seems like a

00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:19,430
totally different situation then the

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,830
next one

00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:24,050
see Calvin just copping out into you

00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:25,970
like the exit of the room of the

00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:27,320
spaceship as it seems and the final one

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,390
we could see the teacher actually

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,390
hanging on to the t-shirt of Calvin who

00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:33,890
seems to hang out of the window looking

00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,810
at each of these panels separately

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,880
doesn't really give us much of a sense

00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,350
what's going on maybe the pros and the

00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,970
speech ballots actually can give us a

00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,730
feeling about like what might be

00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:45,740
happening but it's mostly us actually

00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,660
looking through the image sequence and

00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,850
trying to fill in the gaps between the

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,589
different still images that gives us a

00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:53,930
sense of storytelling and also a sense

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,940
of motion the sense that carbon actually

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,950
hopped out of the window and he was just

00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,080
like imagining it it's nothing that is

00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:03,740
really written down it's something that

00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:05,660
we make up ourselves and yeah I was

00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,570
thinking okay cool like I can probably

00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,970
do something better very straightforward

00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,560
so I was just like Sarge with my comic

00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:14,570
book and I would go like okay like I

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,279
create comic panel components and like

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:18,380
each of this comic parent component can

00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:20,660
have like a property that for example

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:22,520
takes like a URL from the backend for a

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,440
background image and just like displace

00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,450
this as a background image just like a

00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,120
style tag put onto my comic panel

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,910
component saying background-image:url

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,279
and this particular image that i want to

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,080
load I go like okay that's great so now

00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:38,240
I actually have a webcomic I'm already

00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:41,720
and I just have to deploy it I'm on the

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,200
web I can do that thing about further I

00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,240
was like well okay I mean this is

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,220
already okay and I feel like

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,400
accomplished maybe like as an artist now

00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:54,529
but I feel I feel this a bit more

00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,540
potential to the medium that I'm

00:12:54,529 --> 00:12:59,209
currently using because I know I'm a web

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,220
developer I know that I work like with

00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:02,660
JavaScript applications all day long and

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,880
I know there are so many cool things

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,709
that I can actually do in my day job

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,440
that I might also leverage to my

00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,390
advantage by creating this comic book so

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,060
I was thinking okay like I can actually

00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:15,770
get a bit more creative here and I had a

00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:17,540
look also like online I wanted to know

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:20,899
like what are other people doing to you

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:24,890
actually leverage api's of the web and

00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:27,020
also different yet different devices for

00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:29,089
people to actually explore comic art

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,010
experience and I want to share with you

00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:33,120
very quickly this really cool example

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:35,940
that of I found really interesting a

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,710
technically not a web app because it's a

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,779
native app that you can actually use to

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,850
create this experience but it's really

00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,160
really cool and I think it kind of gives

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,520
a very nice introduction into what I

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,760
want to talk to about next so this one

00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,589
is a very cool graphic novel that you

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,290
can experience once you download a

00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:58,350
native app to your to your iPad

00:13:55,290 --> 00:14:00,779
specifically and as you do that you have

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,420
the ability as a user to scroll through

00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:06,930
the graphic novel and actually

00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:09,740
experience a very immersive a very

00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,630
immersive expression of the story as the

00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:14,430
panel's already blend into each other

00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:17,130
you have to feeling that it's a very

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:18,839
fluid experience and it's really cool to

00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:20,550
see it as well it's like mix of just

00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,860
axial images but sometimes also still

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:24,450
images that will like float on top of

00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,860
each other depending on how you move

00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,660
through it and I found it really

00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,070
interesting and this is a really big art

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,080
project actually like people have been

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:33,510
working for I don't know probably years

00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:35,460
as an artist group on actually making

00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,560
this happen and Mariette you ran the

00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:40,260
creator of the story and also the

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,920
artwork and I think really actually did

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:46,650
a great job too you try to combine the

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:49,050
power of the device here for example

00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:51,450
like an iPad and the user interaction

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:55,040
with the story that she wanted to convey

00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:59,880
so I think this is a really cool example

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:02,100
and seeing that I was like okay like I'm

00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,630
not an artist groove like I cannot spend

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,250
like another two years like doing this

00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:09,089
comic-book experience right now unless

00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,010
like my patreon hits off so but I still

00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:12,540
want to try something you know let's

00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,550
let's actually have a look what I can

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,370
actually do on the web right now to make

00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:20,279
this possible and if you remember the

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,050
web like at the 90s and the 2000s II

00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,720
know there have been many attempts to

00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:26,430
bring like cool interactive artful

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,680
experience to the web like maybe you

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:30,660
remember this one like I actually saw

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,900
like a Java applet comic book just

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,360
recently you could do things like that

00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:39,120
maybe like the people beyond 30s they

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,339
also very very well remember that one

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,120
and they go like yeah this were great

00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:46,980
times but also these times are bit over

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,579
a lot of these api's that

00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,769
using back then have been deprecated and

00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:54,630
not very well used because they were

00:15:52,769 --> 00:15:57,329
very proprietary or was like very

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,760
difficult for actually users to install

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,100
the plugins that make it actually for

00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:05,010
them able to explore this experience

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:07,079
that we wanted to deliver and so I want

00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:09,089
to have a look what can I nowadays do to

00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:13,889
create like more cool interactive

00:16:09,089 --> 00:16:15,899
dynamic experiences so I tried out do

00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,940
some things and honestly this is just

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:19,320
like a peek into it there are so many

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,180
other things that you can use nowadays

00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,220
to create this but I want to take you

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,500
into the deep dive into the web

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,329
animations API because I believe this is

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:30,019
a really cool thing that you can now

00:16:27,329 --> 00:16:32,850
address use to create very interactive

00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:37,250
experiences especially if you rock like

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:39,660
in the JavaScript JavaScript wium and

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,389
just like a quick show of hands like who

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,430
has ever worked with the web animations

00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,019
API even if you just like did like a

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,519
doodle on code pen or something and

00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:50,490
hands up who has worked with web

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,980
animations API before okay yeah a couple

00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,899
of people okay not too many yet but yeah

00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,850
we just have a quick look at how the API

00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,970
looks like and then we are all on vote

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:03,029
so when the web animations I the web

00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:05,790
animations API is a very cool native web

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:08,520
api that allows us to create dynamic

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:10,740
animations and also gives us handles to

00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,600
do playback control of these so it's

00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,130
like easier for us to orchestrate also

00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,870
that separate animations together each

00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:17,400
other and we've also seen an example how

00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:19,860
this could look like in the web

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,410
animations API a lot of things boil down

00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,030
to the concept of keyframe effects if

00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,730
you have a look at the API of keyframe

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:28,590
effects we could see its first of all a

00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,860
constructor that allows us to create a

00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,990
keyframe provided by a Dom element but

00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,520
also by keyframes we'll see this a bit

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:41,549
how this looks eyes and animation

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:44,160
options a keyframe arm or like the yeah

00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:45,720
the definition of life the keyframes can

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,910
look something this we can provide

00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,290
different properties any kind of CSS

00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,090
property that we actually can think of

00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,530
for example transform and we could say

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,740
okay let's maybe like translate

00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:59,400
something in our specific Dom element or

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,320
like our Dom element actually from 250

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,230
pixel

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,610
to finally 0 and if you look at this you

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,399
go like ah this seems really familiar

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:09,799
because if you ever worked with css3

00:18:07,399 --> 00:18:12,740
animations you realize oh this is quite

00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:15,139
a very very similar-looking api and in

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,460
fact it definitely is so any kind of

00:18:15,139 --> 00:18:19,340
property that you might have already

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,580
been thinking of animating in the css3

00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,610
room it's also available for you in the

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:28,130
animations API and it's I think a very

00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,590
big advantage of the web images API in

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,909
itself because I believe it also gives a

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,500
lot of people who have like a strong

00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,779
design background and already I'm very

00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:40,039
familiar with this as a great channel to

00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:42,320
actually try to engage with this new

00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:43,639
technology that seems very similar to

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,429
what they might have all been working

00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:51,289
before with before also additionally you

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,509
would have to provide animation options

00:18:51,289 --> 00:18:55,250
what you can pass in here is anything

00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:58,279
that you can also think off with your

00:18:55,250 --> 00:19:01,240
css3 animations so if you think about

00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:05,899
different duration settings and also

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,669
yeah different iterations or any kind of

00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:09,649
animation options that you can think of

00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:11,360
it sees a three-room it also exists in

00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,340
the web animations API and it could

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,879
simply pass it as an object to your

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,320
keyframe constructor method and last but

00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:20,809
not least you also would have to get a

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,899
handle of Dom element this can be for

00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:25,490
example done by document query selector

00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:28,129
or any kind of other API that you know

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:31,070
of that gives you a dumb node and once

00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:32,629
we have this element also your keyframe

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,070
definitions and finally the animation

00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:35,960
options you can actually create your

00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,940
first keyframe effect once you have done

00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,250
this there's an API that you can use to

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,620
take this keyframe effect and just play

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:44,840
and pause the keyframe we would see this

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,750
dress in a bit with another more complex

00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:49,519
example so this seems really

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,769
straightforward I was like okay I want

00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:54,470
to I want to also use this for my

00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:56,659
animations and then I was thinking okay

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,100
it would be would be so cool if I

00:19:56,659 --> 00:19:59,509
actually had like comic panels that

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,159
could like just like do one simple

00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:05,659
animation like something like I don't

00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,340
know just like show me show me like nice

00:20:05,659 --> 00:20:10,820
illustration with just like a couple of

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:12,980
frames for idle or like maybe one second

00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,880
and just like do the animation once so

00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:16,100
once you

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,600
actually sees his image and it moves to

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,250
go like oh wow this is kind of like

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,040
actually interesting I really like this

00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:25,970
is very engaging and I was also thinking

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:27,200
it would be so cool if my animation

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:28,520
experience that I have in this comic

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,560
parents could also be multi-layered

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:32,660
because I know that the web animations

00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:34,910
API allows me to orchestrate animations

00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:37,280
together and I think there's a big

00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,320
advantage to actually using that in my

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,200
application and making it possible to

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,810
create like more complex interactions

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:47,270
that I might have never done with your

00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:48,710
other means that maybe CSS me because I

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:53,300
would have to die to find a lot of

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:55,430
things so I was thinking okay how do I

00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,400
actually get over this and here for

00:20:55,430 --> 00:21:01,160
example we see yeah a description of an

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,570
ember component I think API wise it

00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,950
might look very similar to what you are

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,130
familiar with in your framework of

00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:08,780
choice but the only thing that is not--

00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,840
notice here is that we have a setup

00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,690
method that actually tries to set up the

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,150
animation and more specifically the

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,430
keyframe for us so here for example we

00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,620
define the keyframe States if you want

00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:23,510
to iterate through and here we can

00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:25,550
already see what I actually tried to

00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:27,320
achieve here we can see that there's

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,020
like the background position property

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,750
that I will change through the animation

00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:36,440
and it will shift the background from

00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:40,070
the very top to the bottom if I'm

00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,410
correctly exactly and it's interesting

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:44,060
thing here to note here as well is that

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,980
I'm working with sprite sheet animations

00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,430
so this means I'm creating

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:50,900
stacked images so like 1 2 3 4 5 images

00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:53,030
stacked on each other I take this

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,400
background image put it on my panel and

00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:56,900
then I shift through them but as I do

00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,940
that of course if you imagine what

00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,320
happens then this doesn't really work

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:01,940
right like this doesn't really seem like

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,800
animations this looks like a lottery

00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,960
game or something like a slot machine

00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,210
you know so what I actually also want to

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:10,490
do is actually try to ease through it in

00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,650
a way that I have the feeling okay I

00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,390
actually see the different images one

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:17,270
way to actually handle that is using the

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,850
steps easing function and css3 it's a

00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:22,850
way for me to incrementally go through

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,460
different steps of my animation States

00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:27,620
and really incrementally say okay like

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,440
let's see the first picture and then

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,850
the next one let's move 25% through my

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,520
animation to the next picture

00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:37,370
and so on and this way I actually have

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:42,020
the ability to create like proper frame

00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:43,370
animations in my application that's but

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,900
at least I have to return the key frame

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:47,360
effect I have the element that is

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,280
provided by me through the component API

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,860
I have many mention States I'm animation

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,170
options and then I call an unset up

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,230
function that has been passed down to my

00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:59,750
pen a layer from a parent component the

00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,610
comic panel that I actually create let's

00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,440
have a look at the comic panel component

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:05,660
which is the parent component to all my

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,880
layers that I have in there in there we

00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:10,010
have a set up effects action that is

00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,929
passed down to my layers and here we

00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:14,150
just add all the keyframe effects that

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:16,040
are created by the layers that are

00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:19,790
contained in this comic panel component

00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:21,470
to an array that's but at least once I

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:23,570
have added all of these effects to my

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,640
reign I can use the dip inside element

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,500
hook which is executing my components

00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,330
only when the component has been

00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:32,630
inserted in the dominant also been fully

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,100
rendered and I can create a group effect

00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,830
which is part of the web animations API

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,929
that allows me to collect together all

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:42,770
different kinds of animation States and

00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:45,950
create a new animation instance of it

00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:47,480
that allows me to apply playback control

00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:51,170
on all these different instances of

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,940
keyframes I can create an animation of

00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,550
it an animation instance I could set

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,500
this animation on my component and

00:23:54,550 --> 00:24:01,070
that's but at least once I actually have

00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:03,710
done that I can use the reference to

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:06,620
this animation that have set of my comic

00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:08,300
panel component and use the play and the

00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,910
post method that are provided to me by

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:15,260
the bet animations API to just like play

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:17,150
and pause as I go and the question is

00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:19,309
okay like why actually emerge just like

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:20,690
a few words about this I really like

00:24:19,309 --> 00:24:23,059
that there's a separation of concerns

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:24,620
setting up the different peneleus was

00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:26,140
like more straightforward having the

00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,490
feeling that I can create reusable

00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,790
components and also have a feeling that

00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:34,250
data loading dander handling is handled

00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:36,530
in a very separate fashion from my UI

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,380
components conventional correlation is

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,080
very great because once I actually have

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:42,940
a very conventional framework the

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:45,100
mmunity has a great way for providing me

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:47,620
with cool other functionalities through

00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:50,380
add-ons which is an example that i also

00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,360
want to highlight here in my app for

00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:55,360
example I wanted to have a way for

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,400
people to browse the application and as

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,130
they go they would see that suddenly

00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,080
panels would start to animate giving

00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:03,940
them a more immersive experience having

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,350
the feeling of all my user interaction

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,290
actually drives to me further through

00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:11,470
the story an add-on that I was using

00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:13,720
here is called m1 viewport which uses

00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:15,700
different API is depending on which

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:18,700
browser using to actually make it able

00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,610
to detect if an element is chrome in the

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,160
viewport or not and what it provides is

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,100
a mix and so functionality that can

00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:29,920
blend into my component that provides

00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:32,260
two different hooks and these hooks I

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,780
can leverage to actually play and pause

00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,790
my animation depending on if the

00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,820
component has entered the U port or exit

00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:40,240
to the viewport and once I actually do

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,850
this

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,070
I can finally yeah go through my goes to

00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,960
my application and then you can see are

00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:49,150
the animations start playing and it's

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,860
super beautiful and shiny and I'm just

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:57,040
like happy and crying of joy and that's

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:59,100
but at least I just want to sum up what

00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,630
my thoughts were on this experience I

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,190
thought that it was so amazing to see

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,780
that comics are actually finally going

00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:06,520
online and trying to push the boundaries

00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:10,180
of the traditional medium that have been

00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,640
used since the 18th century and I think

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:16,540
it also shows that the web provides us

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,950
with a great new format to explore

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,590
different forms and different layers of

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,950
web of comics that we won't be able to

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:25,840
do before and also I think the web

00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:29,710
allows us to create very immersive art

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,180
experiences and also a way using for

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,760
example single page applications but

00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:36,040
also component libraries to blend and

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:39,220
user interaction with our art experience

00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,840
and I hope that now you kind of got a

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,160
better understanding that there are many

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,660
different tools that you can use to

00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,300
already do something really cool on the

00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:48,310
web that is very much beyond the comic

00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:50,260
books that your grandparents your

00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:53,320
parents and you yourself have seen and

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,550
hopefully you got yeah maybe like a bit

00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:57,000
of incentive to

00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:59,950
also try something out for yourself or

00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,470
maybe for people that you really like

00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:04,720
and yeah use the imagination to make

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,190
this actually possible and with that sad

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,670
thank you very much

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:15,170
[Applause]

00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:18,049
awesome awesome talk thanks a lot we

00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:21,080
have maybe time for one question and

00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:23,179
yeah we can read it at the top so how do

00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,760
you solve the browser support for this

00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:26,179
web animation API yeah that's a good

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,799
point

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:32,420
yeah it's still experimental and it

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,799
doesn't have like very good browser

00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,420
support yet there are different

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:37,730
polyfills of use that are actually

00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:42,010
dominated not supported to actually

00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:45,380
bring support to other not so super

00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:46,970
greenfield browsers right and in this

00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,799
regard is also Western you mention that

00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:50,330
there are some features that are already

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,309
implemented like the latest from latest

00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:54,559
Firefox you can just use other box and

00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:57,100
that's also a polyfill that actually

00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,730
allows you to use features that are

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:03,590
currently in the yeah in the

00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:05,720
specification period so this polyfill is

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,730
called like that animations next and

00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,580
this for example you can also use to use

00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:13,309
like more advanced features like yeah

00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:16,520
for example sequence sequence effects

00:28:13,309 --> 00:28:21,580
and other things that might not have

00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,580
landed yet also things again

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,730
