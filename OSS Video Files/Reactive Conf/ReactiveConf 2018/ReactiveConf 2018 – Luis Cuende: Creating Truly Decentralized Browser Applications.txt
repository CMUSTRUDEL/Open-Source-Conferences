Creating truly decentralized browser applications

With the onset of decentralized networks like Ethereum and IPFS, applications today are at the cusp of becoming truly decentralized. In this talk, we’ll get our hands dirty by digging into the capabilities that modern browsers offer, to explore how we can not only build on these networks, but also create applications whose feature sets can be extended by anybody in the world for truly decentralized user experiences. Primarily, we’ll take a look at the security assumptions, sandboxing, process spawning, and inter-process communication capabilities available to browser applications that allow a user to run (and trust!) 3rd party code, and how we’ve orchestrated these pieces together at Aragon to build an “operating system” for organizations in the browser.

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:19,030
so I'm Luis from the Aragon project and

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,710
I will get into what it is in a second

00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:22,930
and I want to talk about how to create

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,440
truly decentralized browser applications

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:28,960
and what this means is applications that

00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:31,420
are impossible to censor even if you are

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,149
like in China behind a huge firewall

00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:36,160
even you are in Venezuela whatever you

00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:38,499
are and they are decentralized and they

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,579
can be community run so we can imagine a

00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:41,589
lot of possibilities like a

00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:43,300
decentralized Facebook like a

00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:45,789
decentralized search engine like Google

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,870
at this centralized Dropbox a lot of

00:00:45,789 --> 00:00:48,339
these things like care about user

00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,289
privacy and they are impossible to

00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:52,420
censor in global and run by the

00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,749
community and not by a central company

00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:58,569
which has their own set of interests so

00:00:55,749 --> 00:01:00,760
first of all what's Aragon so Aragon is

00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:03,280
a project to empower freedom by creating

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,890
tools of their label decentralized

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,590
governance and so now you will ask what

00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,120
is the centralized governance and before

00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,310
getting into that I want to know how

00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:18,910
many of you have heard about the word

00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:20,320
blockchain okay and how many of you when

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,860
you think of a blockchain think about

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,750
like scams and like you know crappy icos

00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:30,400
I kind of think that way too sometimes

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,350
so there's a lot of that but what I'm

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,120
going to talk about today is the actual

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,940
technology that is being built and there

00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,960
enables a lot of functionality

00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,820
everything that you're gonna see here in

00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,130
this is lights you don't need any token

00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,650
at all to use it's all free and

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:47,410
open-source and it's actual technology

00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:50,950
that has been built grassroots and not

00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,750
by some kind of scam so technology like

00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:56,710
this that we are seeing here so this is

00:01:52,750 --> 00:02:00,310
the Ariane client and this enables to do

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,380
permissionless boring so for example I'm

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,440
from Spain and I so everything that

00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,030
happened in Catalonia when people

00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,209
basically wanted to vote whether to

00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:11,739
secede from Spain or not and I will not

00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,950
get into a discussion of whether does

00:02:11,739 --> 00:02:17,970
legal illegal whatever but people were

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:20,430
hit people were detained people

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,320
were put into jail because they wanted

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,810
to vote and they were not allowed to

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,150
vote because the systems we have today

00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:28,950
they are very centralized and they

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,020
require you to physically go somewhere

00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,570
in both and that shouldn't be the case

00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,880
if we can have purely decentralized

00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,890
applications decentralized applications

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,530
like voting that we can mathematically

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:43,410
prove that you have bought some auction

00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,660
and some option that you can like proof

00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,370
on a blockchain so everywhere in the

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,620
world you can vote without you know

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,380
going somewhere and getting hit by the

00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:54,750
police that's a huge step forward not

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:57,720
only for places in the first world like

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,400
Spain but also places like Venezuela or

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,010
China where there is a lot of censorship

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,110
going on and apart from that there is

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,709
also the component of efficiency this is

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:11,640
very efficient you use go here and for

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:14,940
example do you wanna make a transfer of

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,040
money and then you know you can use open

00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,600
a boarding from here and then bar in

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,420
this beautiful application which is a

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:23,790
couple clicks so I want to go into what

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,480
we are seeing here so what we are seeing

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:30,959
here it's a decentralized organization

00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:33,570
and a decentralized organization it's an

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,470
organization which can be a company and

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:39,330
nonprofit it can be any kind of entity

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,700
that in the legal world we will consider

00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:43,500
a company a nonprofit whatever in the

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,840
crypto world this is just an

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,670
organization it's code it's a smart

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,470
contract it's code running on a

00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,110
blockchain and you can customize and

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,630
then we have this beautiful front-end

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:57,090
that makes it easy for you to interact

00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,340
with these organizations so an example

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,580
could be instead of going into like a

00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,840
company registry and creating your own

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:06,540
company there and having to go through

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,610
like a central government and having to

00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,910
pay a lot of you know taxes and

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:14,100
registration fees and bureaucracy which

00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,690
sometimes they even censor you like I

00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,609
was trying to create my first company

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,799
when I was fifteen and the Spanish

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:22,019
government basically was like hey you

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:25,140
are not 16 you cannot create a company

00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,539
wait till the earth you know Gosnell

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,130
around around the Sun and then you will

00:04:27,539 --> 00:04:31,530
be able to create a company and then I

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:33,990
was like okay I just wanna you know

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,000
it's an open source and get paid that's

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,260
it I don't wanna I know like a terrorist

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,540
or something I just wanna create a

00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,880
company and with these tools who enabled

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,310
that we enabled that anyone in the world

00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,400
regardless of the gender race religion

00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,220
whatever they can organize they can

00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:53,250
create companies NGOs whatever kind of

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,870
organization that is global from day one

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,760
because it's living on a blockage in the

00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,620
runs across thousands of computers and

00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,620
you don't need to rely on these

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,200
centralized parties like governments or

00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,540
even central companies which have very

00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,790
perverse incentives sometimes as we have

00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,530
seen with all the banking crisis and

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:12,020
well that was the whole reason that

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,650
Bitcoin was created in the first place

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:19,560
and the crypto movement started so I

00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,480
want to talk first about what is

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,400
etherion so how many of you are familiar

00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:27,840
with smart contracts and etherium okay

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,730
well that was more people than I

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,280
expected anyway I will go into it very

00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:36,060
quick so basically smart contracts are

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:38,760
code that is run across all ethereal

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:41,010
notes and aetherium is a blockchain just

00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,050
like bitcoins blockchain - but it's very

00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:45,810
different because in Bitcoin you just

00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,720
have a lot of computers that are

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,680
agreeing on whether you can spend some

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,020
money or not

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,729
so basically solve the problem of double

00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,979
spending so you cannot spend the same

00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:58,050
between twice which before Bitcoin is

00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:59,550
what it was not possible in a

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:02,370
decentralized manner you have to rely on

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:04,500
a bank to check if your balance was

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,470
greater than zero or not and then the

00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,270
less you transact aetherium takes that

00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:11,370
philosophy to the next level and

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,740
basically says I want to be able to have

00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:16,260
any state transition so I want to be

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,330
able to have a network of computers that

00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:20,490
are running a virtual machine and then

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,470
you can execute any code there and if

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:24,960
the code is correct and you are creating

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,510
a good statement system then this state

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,820
is updated on what is called the smart

00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:31,830
contract and so here we can see a

00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:34,800
counter so this is a very simple

00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:37,530
contract this counter here just has an

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,979
estate which is a an integer and then

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,650
you can increment or decrement it very

00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,180
simple and this happens on chain so

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,650
basically if you want to increment

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,660
you have to create an ethereal

00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:50,850
transaction and broadcast it to the

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,289
Thira network and then the theory nodes

00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,979
will check okay

00:06:52,289 --> 00:06:58,949
is this address is this entity allowed

00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,110
to perform this action can it increment

00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:03,120
the counter or not and if it can it will

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,400
increment the counter and if not it will

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,919
decrement like very simple and every

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,190
single ethereal node every single node

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,070
on the network can then fetch the new

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,039
value for this counter and as we see

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,470
here a theorem is actually very reactive

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,360
in the sense that if you see the events

00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,699
the event you were there what we are

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,530
saying is when someone increments or

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:28,740
decrements the counter we are going to

00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,330
emit an event because the theorem

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,280
virtual machine is a built-in machine

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,410
that is executing across thousands of

00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,750
nodes and this consensus is great

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,210
because you solve the problem of double

00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:41,220
spending you can have a single truth of

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:43,860
what is the state of any given

00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:45,509
decentralized app but on the other hand

00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,430
it is very expensive to execute you

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,720
cannot execute very complex logic here

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,880
because it's gonna be executed across

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,289
thousands of nodes and they require a

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,180
fee for that because otherwise they

00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:56,699
wouldn't be incentivized to perform any

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,530
computation power so you gotta be very

00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,080
careful about what happens here and so

00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,510
instead of having all the estate here as

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,490
we will see later we just have events

00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,470
and then the clients can consume the

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,120
event and can recreate can reduce the

00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,099
events and can create a final state that

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,620
we sell to a user and that in a write is

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:15,090
like the OP code basically the stuff

00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,550
that it's like under the hood and the

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:20,789
smart contract in the left it's a fully

00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,979
feature builder machine so I solve the

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,930
app before it is a very simple

00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,970
straightforward app to use but it's a

00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,830
purely decentralized one and it's purely

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,919
censorship resistant so I want to go

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:34,079
into the architecture so you secure the

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,260
the beautiful app and then to the left

00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:39,779
you see some items talking manager

00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:41,190
button and then to the right you see

00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,649
this voting app but then if you go to

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:45,120
the finance app as we see before it's a

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,910
different app that enables you to do

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,279
another different thing and how we see

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,920
this is you know this centralized

00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,290
organizations and organizations in

00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,880
general enabled you to create ways of

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:58,360
human organization that were not

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,249
possible before

00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,110
so it's just like a template like

00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:03,879
company or NGO which is very brief and

00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:06,549
you have to choose one here you can like

00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,929
plug and play different smart contracts

00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:12,100
different views of code to create your

00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:13,689
organization so what we thought is we

00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,399
don't know how these organizations will

00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:18,160
behave because we just can't predict the

00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,100
future so we will just make Aragon into

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,079
an app platform we Bo can create apps

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,730
and they can create apps like token

00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,439
manager bought in finance but it comes

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,689
to create very complex apps that do very

00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:30,939
different things and so I want to get

00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:32,860
into how the architecture works because

00:09:30,939 --> 00:09:35,829
we are achieving here is we are kind of

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,749
creating an operating system with all

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,910
the security assumptions and some boxing

00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:42,670
assumptions that that has inside a

00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,319
browser and so basically here you have

00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:46,720
the Argan client to the left and then

00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:50,230
you have sandbox up and so this sandbox

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,799
app cannot do any malicious thing to the

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,269
client for example when you deal with

00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,220
crypto and you deal with the theorem and

00:09:55,269 --> 00:10:01,029
you deal with like money that is not

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:02,829
held by a bank if you is a user signs a

00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,199
transaction that they didn't want to

00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:07,029
sign then their money is gone so there

00:10:05,199 --> 00:10:09,040
are a lot of ways to deceive users into

00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,839
doing that which you know is kind of the

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,189
way like a lot of crypto scams are

00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:15,850
famous because you can really steal a

00:10:12,189 --> 00:10:18,879
lot of money this way and so what we do

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:20,470
is these apps are all iframes and then

00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:23,169
these iframes have some web workers

00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:25,119
because as I was telling before it is

00:10:23,169 --> 00:10:26,739
you have to fetch a lot of data from the

00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:28,509
blockchain so for example if you have a

00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:32,799
boring app you have a smart contract

00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:34,779
similar to the counter I use is own and

00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:37,089
what you have here is you have full of

00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:39,009
events so when you devote for example to

00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:41,049
this mark contract this mark contra will

00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:43,329
emit an event which is there was a new

00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:45,129
vote and then since this is purely

00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:48,610
decentralized this doesn't have any

00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:50,889
single server at all no Amazon no Google

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:53,589
cloud no server at all this is purely

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:55,629
decentralized and it's peer-to-peer what

00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:57,819
we need to do then is we cannot rely on

00:10:55,629 --> 00:11:00,819
a centralized server with a centralized

00:10:57,819 --> 00:11:02,769
MongoDB instance we don't have that so

00:11:00,819 --> 00:11:04,449
what we have to do is we have to watch

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:06,309
this my contract we have to watch the

00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:08,439
theorem blockchain and the state changes

00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,539
that happen there and we have to slowly

00:11:08,439 --> 00:11:12,010
consume that state and reduce that state

00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:14,530
to something that the

00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,480
in UI console and so instead of doing

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:18,700
that in the in the main thread what we

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,670
do is that each app loads its own web

00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,990
worker and I will get into that later

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,970
and then you have this mark contract

00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,640
so it's app has its own as my contract

00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:30,790
basically which the script the web

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:33,220
worker is fetching data from so this is

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,680
how the how it would look like so you

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,690
see there it says server but that's not

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,720
like a cloud server that refers to like

00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:44,860
the Ireland client which is what apps

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:47,020
are run inside of it so you see like the

00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,790
theory mirror machine down there all

00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,410
this mark contracts and then you see

00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,660
like the JavaScript part of it which is

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:54,690
basically the stuff that reduces the

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:56,920
state and then you have the client UI

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:58,540
which is the sidebar that we saw with

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,250
like the one you can choose the apps and

00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:04,390
then the app UI which is individual apps

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:06,280
or sandbox so this one of my favorite

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,410
parts of all of this is not how the

00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,600
architecture works but how data is

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:13,900
delivered so we are used to package

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,030
managers like NPM and NPM is great and

00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,310
everything but have you seen the es lint

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,140
you know issue that happened like I

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,820
think three months ago or so like

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:25,030
basically this package managers can have

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:27,460
a lot of malicious actors behind them so

00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:28,960
you're gonna have NPM trying to trick

00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:31,990
you into downloading some malicious

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,390
software you can have a like a manager

00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,220
from some package that you spoofs a new

00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:38,770
version that is malicious and then you

00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:40,690
do MPX or whatever and you're basically

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:42,730
like executing like malware on your

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,830
computer and we are doing that all day

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,830
we are like doing npm install and MPX

00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,300
all day and nothing happens but then you

00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:51,250
know some days nothing happens like the

00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,730
es link back and then we all lose a lot

00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:56,980
of money so that's bad so what we came

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,810
up with is instead of having a

00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,400
centralized package manager that is in a

00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,740
centralized server with everything that

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:05,470
that conveniens let's create a

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,150
decentralized vargas mayor and so with a

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:09,040
decentralized package manager living on

00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:13,690
etherion you can do something like this

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:16,150
you can have a package maintainer which

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,000
uploads some data to some decentralized

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:23,140
peer-to-peer data hosting like ipfs or

00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,480
swarm and then the this package

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:29,139
maintainer can include URL

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,060
of where these data blob lives inside a

00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,220
smart contract just like the one we saw

00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,790
earlier and this is my contract is very

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,040
simple

00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,110
it used tracks versions of a new packets

00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:40,029
and then you can have different

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,040
governance mechanisms for how these

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,139
packages are updated so you can say I

00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,060
want to have a package registry in which

00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:48,730
I am the dictator and I can just post

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,459
updates or I can have something more

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,980
modular in which like I am the person or

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:56,410
like some committee of persons can push

00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:58,540
new versions but the community has to

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,779
review them and has to vote on whether

00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:03,399
they are malicious or not and maybe they

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:06,940
have some tokens so like the maintainer

00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,980
has some tokens staked and if the

00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,290
maintainer booth pushes some malicious

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,820
code then the community can say hey I

00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,320
want to slash your stake and then you

00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,940
lost money you lose like if they're on

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,230
any token that you have finished my

00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,510
contract because you were pushing a

00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:21,070
malicious code update so this is very

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,529
cool because first of all there is no

00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:25,089
centralized server at all these have

00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,940
references to where the data is stored

00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:29,470
on chain both for smart contracts

00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,209
because you can also update the smart

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,529
contracts with this system which is one

00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:34,899
of the problems that the blockchain has

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:36,550
it's available by default so with this

00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,410
we can actually fix that we can make a

00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:41,170
smart contracts upgradable so we can fix

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:43,720
them and fix bugs as well and release

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,730
new updates and enhancements but we can

00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,670
also release any data blobs

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,470
so we can have a decentralized NPM or we

00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,510
can have a decentralized Android app

00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,310
store which is bettered by the community

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:55,899
and people can check what's going on and

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,910
there is no centralized server or

00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:59,769
company that needs to run this you can

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:01,899
use airdrop a bunch of tokens to your

00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:04,389
community and have them both on the

00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,220
staff about how these packets man I used

00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:08,260
to work and I think this how package

00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,720
managers are going to work in the next

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:12,819
few years because centralization doesn't

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,319
help where when there's a lot of

00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:15,310
mistakes it's just with package managers

00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,500
or NPM

00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,970
you do NPM install these days and you

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:22,329
have like a small library which can be

00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:25,149
called like is RI as array buffer or

00:15:22,329 --> 00:15:26,680
whatever or I have seen terrible like

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:30,040
you know packages there are just like

00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,740
literally one line of code and then they

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,140
get a malicious actor in them and your

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,089
whole project is a screwed so we

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,200
shouldn't do that

00:15:37,089 --> 00:15:40,790
another part of the architecture that I

00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,370
want to talk about is the absent

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:44,899
manifest so basically you have here for

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,880
all of the apps that we were seeing in

00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:48,950
the sidebar first of all the finance app

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,860
they have a very simple manifesto

00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,800
this is like an estándar manifest for

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,920
apps and then they also have these were

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,220
manifest which says okay I'm a finance

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,440
app and as a finance app I need to

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:06,019
access a vault and the vault is where

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,779
the money is actually very simple smart

00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:11,959
contract in which the money is actually

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:15,529
stored so the finance app says hey as a

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:18,680
dependency I want to have the vault and

00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:20,600
I need permission to transfer money from

00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:23,889
the vault this is very similar to how

00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:26,540
permissions work in like Android or iOS

00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:27,980
and using this very pluggable system you

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,540
can have different apps that are request

00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:32,149
different permissions from the user and

00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:33,459
from other apps so you can say if you

00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:36,079
install the finance app in your

00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:39,410
organization you need to have a vault

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:43,370
where the funds are stored and then as

00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:45,050
you can see here the finance app can

00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,720
also define some roles which is the

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,490
permission which is as an app what can I

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,470
do for the other apps in this case it

00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:53,630
can create new payments so you can build

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,699
really complex systems here which have a

00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:58,370
lot of different functionality by doing

00:16:55,699 --> 00:16:59,779
like very simple modules just following

00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:01,120
like the UNIX philosophy kind of thing

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,290
just have a lot of very simple things

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,299
we're just so great for security because

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,790
it smart contracts shouldn't be complex

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,079
because they can be hacked and so I

00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:12,549
think that's that's great for the

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:16,040
architecture then we have some boxes so

00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:18,260
what happens if an app is malicious and

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,510
decides to try to steal some funds and

00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:22,910
this decides to like you know tell the

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,709
user hey sign a transaction with your

00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:27,530
etherion wallet because you will both

00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,870
but then what it does is it doesn't both

00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:33,350
it basically like you know central

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,940
advanced to like an attacker so that

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,590
cannot happen because then we will have

00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:39,860
to review every single app we will have

00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,419
to kind of follow the like Apple model

00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,740
and like review every single package

00:17:41,419 --> 00:17:45,200
make sure that all the apps are not

00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:47,299
accessing any malicious API so we don't

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,280
want to do that because something that I

00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,090
forgot to mention is all of this code is

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,760
open source

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,320
because otherwise if you have apps that

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,170
are not open source you cannot really

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,720
trust what it's running inside them in

00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:01,940
the smart contracts but nevertheless is

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,220
great to have a lot of Sun boxing here

00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:07,340
so basically what we have is an iframe

00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,610
and if I click boat for example this

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:13,910
sends a message to the parent and so the

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:16,460
parent says okay this app wants to sign

00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:19,370
something and instead of letting the app

00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:21,470
directly sign transactions it so another

00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,360
signer view at the top level of the app

00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:25,340
at the parent level which tells the user

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,880
information about what they are gonna do

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:31,130
and so the user can make sure that they

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,750
only can sign transactions if it comes

00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,850
from this parent level screen another

00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:36,230
way around and so when a transaction is

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,730
signed it goes to a theory and virtual

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:42,650
machine and then for example let's say

00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,870
this client was the one pushing a boat

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:47,810
and this line is the one pulling it so

00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:49,100
like updating the UI so basically you

00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:51,110
can get the event from the blockchain

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,910
and then the parent context sends that

00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:55,580
to the web worker and then the web

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,070
worker reduces the state and when the

00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,470
state changes it sends that back to the

00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:04,250
app UI the cool thing is all the web

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:06,110
workers as I also hear all the web

00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:09,170
workers the background scripts are

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,670
basically run at the parent context so

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:14,270
as you know like they are sandbox

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:17,930
because you cannot access the Dom or do

00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:21,320
any any of that and so we actually fetch

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:24,740
the web worker script from ipfs and then

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,600
we don't really like a local URL for

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,940
security and so basically what we have

00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,620
here is we have a lot of life for

00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,450
example five background scripts are

00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,950
constantly fetching data so when you

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,630
open the app it automatically loads

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:37,490
because that's a huge problem for

00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:40,160
decentralized apps they are great and

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,270
some serval unstoppable but then like

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,920
you know you don't have any server that

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:47,510
is caching for you so you gotta do this

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:49,130
kind of things and then finally I want

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,780
to show how to build up totally

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:52,790
centralized up you see this system I

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,230
believe we have built the easiest way to

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,090
create a decentralized app you don't

00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:57,560
have to care about a lot of like smart

00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,690
contracts heavy stuff you don't have to

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,950
care about a great ability you don't

00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:02,240
have to care about package management

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,290
you can post new updates of your

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,850
front-end or

00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:06,860
as my contracts in a purely

00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,900
decentralized fashion something that I

00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,490
forgot to add is all the apps that we

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,140
were seeing there they actually use our

00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:16,250
package managers so they are all fed for

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:18,530
an IP FS so if you go to like Aragon

00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,510
p.m. comm that is like a gateway to the

00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:23,900
decentralized world - Aragon p.m. dot

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:27,170
Eve which fetches the last hash in the

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,970
packets manager from the package one you

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:30,740
want to get she's purely decentralized

00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,390
there is no central server role the only

00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,850
central point of failure right now is

00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:36,440
our centralized gateway which is Aragon

00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:38,000
p.m. comm which is like a you know

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,710
dot-com domain so that's a centralized

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,330
point of failure but then if you run

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,040
your own ITF s node it's purely

00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:46,210
centralized you can be in China you can

00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:48,500
be whatever it works so this is how

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,840
running and I are gonna works is very

00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,570
simple used to Aragon in it it creates

00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,250
your app and then you do a logon run it

00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,390
does really like blockchain stuff for

00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,560
you so you won't have to worry about

00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:59,240
that you just have to worry about

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,890
creating a great user experience they're

00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,660
responsive and creating a smart

00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,800
contracts that are easy because you can

00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,180
leverage all the other apps for example

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,820
you don't have to implement your own

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:09,740
finance mechanisms or body mechanisms

00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,450
you can use put all the apps as a

00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:14,030
dependency the boring on I'm finance

00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,950
apps then you do Aragon run it generates

00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:18,470
a lookup block team for testing for you

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:21,950
in its ipfs creates a decentralized

00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:23,450
organization all the cool stuff so if

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,100
you--if you want to try out how to

00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:27,530
create apps I think this that's a that's

00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,050
a very cool way finally I wanted that by

00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:32,000
talking a little bit about stuff that is

00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:34,460
been built so for example we all know

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,590
that Microsoft bought it hub and we're

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,150
probably not very happy about that so it

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,740
was supposed to be decentralized but

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:41,630
then you have github which adds a lot of

00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:44,090
great features and that is centralized

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:46,670
so with the stuff like panda panda is a

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,550
product that was built using the Aragon

00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:51,680
SDK and pandas a purely decentralized

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:52,190
control version system built on

00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,350
aetherium

00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:56,810
so you have a smart contract which

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,510
tracks changes and then you have the

00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:00,380
data itself in ipfs or arm or like a

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,290
decentralized

00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,810
data provider and you can add Berger our

00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:07,220
permissions so you can say for example

00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:09,200
these are the formant a nurse and these

00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,180
are the four people that can merciful

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,490
request but poor requests can only

00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:15,020
emerge in the codebase if there is a

00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:17,000
boring and the community approves that

00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:19,100
and you can do a lot of cool things here

00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,900
for example open-source sustainability

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,760
you can have a pool of funds into a

00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,500
decentralized organization that gets

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,630
released over time as people make pull

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,250
requests and they get merged so that's

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,380
very cool because there are products

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,510
like Python that don't have a clear

00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,010
leader anymore and anyway this wouldn't

00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:35,330
have clear leaders these are community

00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,590
run projects and this would be run with

00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:39,789
the community and it is the best way to

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:42,770
run open-source projects by a community

00:22:39,789 --> 00:22:45,409
so I don't have a lot of a lot of time

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:46,549
to get into a lot of details but we've

00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:49,010
been working on this decentralized

00:22:46,549 --> 00:22:52,880
organizations for a lot of time since

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:55,520
November 2016 I've been into crypto

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,960
since 2011 and decent rights

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,280
organizations are truly the thing that

00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,659
can really solve a lot of the world

00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,850
problems that we are seeing here from

00:22:59,659 --> 00:23:03,679
like you know they like micro problems

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,150
like I'm a 15 year old and I cannot

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,710
create a company to contribute an

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,960
open-source or to get rewarded for

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,090
working on open source - like the macro

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,590
problems - like basically Donald Trump

00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:15,140
getting elected into the u.s. because

00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:17,150
democracy doesn't work anymore and I

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:18,799
think the centrist organizations really

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:21,380
unleash a lot of possibilities on how we

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,600
organize so we were working on this

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,330
stuff for like a year and a half or this

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,970
unboxing all these mod pieces so it's a

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,860
truly decentralized app when we release

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,620
this it's an ester bubble like even if

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:35,510
our whole team goes to Hawaii or like we

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,780
like we were in a plane and the plane

00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:40,549
crashes it will still work there

00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,159
wouldn't be a lot of commits yet but a

00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:47,090
lot like people commit him but a lysse

00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:48,140
will work without us at all so we've

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,970
been also working on a smart contract

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,530
audits because if you know about the

00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,809
theory misplaced there was a huge hack a

00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:55,490
couple years ago 150 million dollars got

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:58,190
stolen because Marc contracts are great

00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,890
but I said before they were used to be

00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,350
Mirabal and with the mutability comes a

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,570
lot of risk because when you put smart

00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,740
contracts or code as a programmer it's

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:08,960
very hard to make sure that your

00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,610
contract doesn't have any bugs so we're

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,460
working on this for a long time we have

00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,110
under went like a lot of like security

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,740
audits to make sure everything is great

00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:19,250
and after a lot of work and a year and a

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,530
half

00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,559
everything that I using here which

00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:26,510
before today was this testing you could

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,480
just test them and by the way there are

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,620
more than 15 k organizations created

00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,330
this last year with our ago

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,880
that's more than the number of

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:36,650
businesses in Malta Luxembourg and I

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,230
think like Finland together for the same

00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:41,710
period of time so this is like this

00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:44,660
creating more businesses than like

00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,400
countries which is great but they were

00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:48,470
all tests they were all running on a

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,460
test network so we don't lose any funds

00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,190
because we wanted to make sure

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,960
everything was right and after a lot of

00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,880
work today

00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:59,059
everything is finally right and we are

00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:03,160
listening Aragon 0.6 Alva which you can

00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:03,160
try now it may net dot Aragon dot org

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,180
[Applause]

00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:15,679
thank you very much Luis and I still

00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:17,570
have a couple things is very quick if

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,520
that sounds interesting we are green

00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:23,270
eyes in a conference in Berlin called

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:26,540
Eric on Eric 1.1 check it out it's in

00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:28,190
January and finally if you want a hug

00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,540
hotdogs are gone that org you can

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,900
experiment with governance at a speed of

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,100
software finally and one last thing come

00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,220
to drink beer with us

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,450
so 7:30 we're gonna be drinking beers

00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:40,370
and the whole depth team is gonna be

00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:46,520
with us celebrating this launch so

00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:47,420
that's it thanks everyone that's ready

00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,490
for a few questions

00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:52,160
sounds right yeah good let's go to the

00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:55,040
first one what is the use case for NT

00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:57,559
tokens in the system that's a great

00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,679
question so AMT is a talking that we

00:25:57,559 --> 00:26:02,330
released and basically AMT fixes one of

00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,640
the problem is that there are we

00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,230
decentralized organizations so as I said

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,940
before all of these you can use it

00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:09,410
without any token because we believe

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,730
this is core infrastructure for the

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,740
decentralized world this would be free

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,900
to use but then what's the problem with

00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:16,550
the smart contracts they are great

00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:18,350
because they are computer code so they

00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,090
are efficient you can for example have

00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:21,650
payroll app and we are going to have a

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,540
payroll app for ourselves to pay our own

00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:25,970
salary on chain without doing anything

00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,540
it just pays you but then you have more

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:31,610
complex stuff like for example imagine

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:33,890
you hire someone and do when I give them

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,450
a laptop but they sue you because the

00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:37,100
laptop was compromised or something

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:38,900
these things the blockchain doesn't know

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,490
about so we are creating is a purely

00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,590
decentralized restriction called the

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,419
Aragon network using a country you will

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:46,009
have a court in which you'll be able to

00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:48,139
disputes in a purely decentralized

00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,609
fashion no central escort role no

00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,379
centralized legal system everything's

00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:53,690
gonna be decentralized and community-run

00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:56,570
so that's a use case for A&T governance

00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,029
over that Network right next question

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,980
from anonymous since you can't delete

00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:02,929
entries in blockchain how can you

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,669
respect the right to be forgotten in

00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:08,539
Europe that is an amazing question and I

00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:10,399
don't really have an answer for that

00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:11,899
it's very tricky they would think of the

00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,600
Box in is you can be pseudonymous

00:27:11,899 --> 00:27:16,279
so what I encourage everyone to do is

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,259
don't use your real name

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,239
let's come back to like the 90s where

00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:22,609
Facebook wasn't a thing and people were

00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,529
use valued for their content and not for

00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,989
the nickname or Twitter followers so I

00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:29,090
just hope we come back to that mm-hmm

00:27:26,989 --> 00:27:31,749
all right don't you think owners of

00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:34,309
packages can still inject malicious code

00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:36,019
well they can but we reduce what they

00:27:34,309 --> 00:27:39,049
can do a lot they cannot change

00:27:36,019 --> 00:27:40,759
transactions and if it's like a generic

00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,289
package deploy to the Aragon package

00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:44,869
manager at least you can have a

00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:46,940
community veto so they can check the

00:27:44,869 --> 00:27:49,340
code and be like no we're not pushing

00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,859
this out so nothing is perfect but this

00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:55,269
really really increases security for

00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:58,190
like all Upton you can run basically

00:27:55,269 --> 00:28:00,049
mm-hmm all right what are you doing

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:02,480
better than other products like a DA

00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:04,369
there are so many ERC 20 tokens out

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,609
there without a real product do you have

00:28:04,369 --> 00:28:08,840
a working product that is used well I

00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:09,859
don't want to talk about it talking so

00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,470
much because this was about the

00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:13,609
architecture but basically that token

00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,769
there's a blockchain we are not a

00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:17,119
blockchain we're a non aetherium so the

00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,649
token is for the governance of the

00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,629
Aragon Network so I think it's

00:28:18,649 --> 00:28:22,249
comparable to like those tokens and I

00:28:20,629 --> 00:28:24,109
mean it's talking hydration

00:28:22,249 --> 00:28:28,820
functionality a lot of them are scams

00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:30,230
and ours is use a governess way for for

00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:31,399
people to control the Aragon Network

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,230
because we are really into this thing of

00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,480
like being community govern within this

00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:39,950
goods so the community goods Andromeda

00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:41,889
community ok any comparison to di t

00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:44,690
protocol be Krauser

00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:46,279
yeah so the DAT protocol is something

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,639
more similar to like ipfs which are

00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:51,649
decentralized storage system we use IP

00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:54,230
FS and we could also use the 80 for

00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:56,239
example I think it's great for storage

00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,279
so you could build the Aragon package

00:28:56,239 --> 00:29:00,139
manager' on top of dat actually which

00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:02,059
for any data reference so if you put

00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:04,940
like a DAT reference and you implement

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:07,700
some code inside our library to fetch

00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:10,399
files from not only ipfs but also dat it

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,899
will work so yeah it's fine mm-hmm

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,769
next one Louis who pays for the

00:29:11,899 --> 00:29:18,289
computation power okay that's well the

00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:19,700
right now is the users so if you want to

00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,919
create a decentralized organization

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,719
today you have to pay fees to the theory

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,239
or network and that's around ten dollars

00:29:23,719 --> 00:29:27,859
this is still I probably list that when

00:29:26,239 --> 00:29:29,090
you get for like incorporating a company

00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:31,609
like for example in Switzerland is like

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:34,249
a hundred K or so so I think then K is a

00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:36,469
fine price to create businesses probably

00:29:34,249 --> 00:29:41,059
for one last question how will you

00:29:36,469 --> 00:29:42,700
prevent 51% attack inside the blockchain

00:29:41,059 --> 00:29:45,019
well that's nothing that the blockchain

00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:46,909
has to do like we are not a blockchain

00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:49,489
so we are relying on the blockchain to

00:29:46,909 --> 00:29:51,589
work a thing about 51% the tax is you

00:29:49,489 --> 00:29:53,299
can do two things one half economic

00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:55,249
incentives so that's very expensive to

00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,529
do like hundreds of millions or even

00:29:55,249 --> 00:29:59,179
billions of dollars and second you can

00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:01,309
hard work so you can be like I don't

00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:02,839
like this you know entity here that is

00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:05,059
trying to attack me I will create

00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:07,639
another fork without this entity in the

00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:09,169
system and you can do that fantastic

00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,610
all right let's give Louis a hand thank

00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:12,400
you very much

00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:14,460
[Applause]
