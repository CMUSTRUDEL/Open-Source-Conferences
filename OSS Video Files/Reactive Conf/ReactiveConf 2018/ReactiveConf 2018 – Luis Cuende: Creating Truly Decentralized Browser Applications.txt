Creating truly decentralized browser applications

With the onset of decentralized networks like Ethereum and IPFS, applications today are at the cusp of becoming truly decentralized. In this talk, we’ll get our hands dirty by digging into the capabilities that modern browsers offer, to explore how we can not only build on these networks, but also create applications whose feature sets can be extended by anybody in the world for truly decentralized user experiences. Primarily, we’ll take a look at the security assumptions, sandboxing, process spawning, and inter-process communication capabilities available to browser applications that allow a user to run (and trust!) 3rd party code, and how we’ve orchestrated these pieces together at Aragon to build an “operating system” for organizations in the browser.
