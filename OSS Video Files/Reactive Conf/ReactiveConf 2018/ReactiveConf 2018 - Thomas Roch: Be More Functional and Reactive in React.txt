Be More Functional and Reactive in React

Components with an unidirectional data flow have become the most popular way to build UIs. With such architecture, there is still one outstanding question: what do we do with side-effects? And they are everywhere: logging, error reporting, network requests, websockets, analytics, storage persistence, etc. In this talk, we will explore how observability is key to side-effects, and how reactive programming can unleash a slew of possibilities. I'll demonstrate how a new library called Refract can help you be more Functional and Reactive in React.
