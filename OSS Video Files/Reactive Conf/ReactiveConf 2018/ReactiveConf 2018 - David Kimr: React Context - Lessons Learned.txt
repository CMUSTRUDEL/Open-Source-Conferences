React Context - Lessons Learned

As Unicornâ€™s CTO, I am responsible for the design and development of the Unicorn Mobile-first IoT-ready Cloud Architecture that all of our most recent products and projects use to deliver end-user functionality to our customers. The key part of the architecture is a React-based frontend library called UU5. Making React Context official in version 16.3 (with new API) we have upgraded several concepts in the library using the new feature - themes, multi-language, SPA layout and components communication. The speech will cover our experience with React Context and will show cases where React Context can help and be more efficient as compared to traditional Redux/MobX state managers.
