Description: 
	React is great and Flux is awesome. Running both on the server and client is even better! You've built your app with the latest and greatest tech stack, but will your app scale to millions of users? We created and open sourced Fluxible and other libraries that support Yahoo's high-traffic web applications. I'll share our learnings and go through best practices, performance concerns, and challenges of building robust and scalable web applications.

Rajiv is software engineer at Yahoo working on node.js and Fluxible (Universal Flux and React) frontends that power high-traffic web applications.
