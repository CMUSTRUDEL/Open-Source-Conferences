so my name is javie Velasco I work for a

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,719
company called social bro I'm Spanish

00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,660
I'm from Cordova little town in the

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,349
south of Spain and I've been building

00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:22,539
these days a little too which I call

00:00:19,349 --> 00:00:24,490
react toolbox I'm making that with a

00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:27,840
friend you can go to the projects page

00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:33,190
and uncheck what we've done so far and

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,199
what is it it's a library of component

00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,979
react components implementing material

00:00:35,199 --> 00:00:41,350
designed gathered Lions so you probably

00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:43,300
know there is already a project which is

00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,249
doing more or less the same but they are

00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,989
they have some things that I don't

00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:49,989
especially like and it's not quite

00:00:46,989 --> 00:00:53,440
compatible well with what we wanted to

00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:57,399
do so first of all I don't like in line

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,319
styling by the way I loved the talk by

00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,269
mark I don't know if you were there

00:00:59,319 --> 00:01:04,210
before but we are facing more or less

00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:06,100
the same problems so I wanted to create

00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,190
something different from that and also

00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,760
create a proof of concept or for CSS

00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:15,490
models so there's another things that I

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,180
wanted to do like generating more

00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:21,100
semantic markup for our components and

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,130
also I we are creating this because

00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,850
people love material design and I wanted

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:30,370
to open source components we SI so far I

00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,710
never contribute too much I never give

00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,830
too much to the community I away we

00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:39,160
wanted to start with it so the proposal

00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:41,320
includes CSS models and an integration

00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,570
with web pack which is pretty well known

00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,610
and I'm sure that all of you are using

00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:50,800
in your current workflows and so as we

00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:55,030
are using webpack we can also include

00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:58,810
such loader so we can have better style

00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,600
sheets and we faced also the problem

00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:05,729
with the customization thing we created

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:09,640
something similar to what mark refer

00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:12,220
this morning which is a customized a

00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,159
little toolbox loader is just like 10

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,470
lines of JavaScript that allows you to

00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:20,770
give to the library early

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,250
style well it's not quite a stylish

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,600
it but our file with SAS variables

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,960
overriding the things that you want to

00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,660
change for the final build so we have a

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:35,020
component structure that is composed by

00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:38,020
a configuration configuration file with

00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,600
such a configuration variables and a

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,750
stylesheet the component JavaScript

00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:46,360
source I'm also we have the Reedman the

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,640
same file assets and maybe subcomponents

00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,580
it if the in case their components is

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,260
quite complicated so for now your

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:55,630
feedback is quite important we got

00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,500
because a something the components are

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,720
not being used it yet in a big project

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,030
there are some things that I want to get

00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,740
the most possible feedback from it for

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,050
example what happens if I don't want to

00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:10,450
use web back well I don't know exactly

00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,770
how can this can be integrated with

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:15,970
another workflow but i'm pretty sure

00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:17,110
that we can find a way and also i don't

00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,830
know if there is a better way to

00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:23,320
integrate dimmable components and the

00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:26,800
stateless thing everybody's going for

00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:30,730
state a stateless component nowadays and

00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,340
we have some of them actually with a

00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,350
state and exposing some methods I think

00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,950
I think that this is going to change

00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,110
soon but it's important that you

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:44,050
contribute and give your opinion on how

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,540
come we build the best possible API for

00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:48,459
all these components and also the use

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,959
cases which is so important because I

00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:53,080
don't know how can be actually

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,320
integrated with redox yet but I am sure

00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,680
that it's going to move all these

00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:01,510
components to the stateless for now we

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:05,230
released the first version just 24 hours

00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:09,130
ago and we go end from 34 starts to

00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:11,560
almost 500 in a just in 20 hours I think

00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:14,290
it's a good number so the community is

00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:18,609
embracing that be ready I think very

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:21,250
happy so this is the first version we

00:04:18,609 --> 00:04:24,130
want to build it with you and we created

00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:27,250
a little playground in the documentation

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,169
site so you can test the components and

00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:33,319
you can try how are they

00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:36,710
working so i'm going to show you here a

00:04:33,319 --> 00:04:41,330
little bit of this a playground to stay

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:44,569
the home page and here in the components

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:46,490
page we have a list of components over

00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:48,259
here you have this installation page

00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,629
also and you will have this little

00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:52,400
bottom here so you can try every

00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,830
component for example if you want to try

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,020
the button you can click here you can

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:59,330
see an example click loading playground

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,580
and you can see here are an editor which

00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:07,960
is a dumping here the components you can

00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:07,960
