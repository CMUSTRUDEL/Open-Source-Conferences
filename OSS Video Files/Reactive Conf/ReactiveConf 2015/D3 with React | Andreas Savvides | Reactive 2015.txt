Description: 
	d3 has been the de facto standard when it comes to data visualisations for a while now and React has recently emerged as the go-to library for building user interfaces. d3 and React are both data-centric libraries, making them a natural fit; d3 takes a data-driven approach and React aims to solve the problem of data changing over time in the context of building large applications. 
There have been various approaches documented on how to effectively use d3 and React together. In this talk, I will be going through a number of these approaches, talking about what I have learned from them and how I go about creating reusable chart components for large scale applications.

Andreas is a full-stack, product-driven Software Engineer who enjoys building interactive single page applications with rich data visualisations.
