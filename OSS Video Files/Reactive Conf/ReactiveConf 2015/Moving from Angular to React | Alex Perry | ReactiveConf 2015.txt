I'm hi everybody today I wanted to talk

00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:12,129
to you about moving from angular to

00:00:08,799 --> 00:00:13,510
react my name is Alex but first of all I

00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:14,980
know it's been you know you listen to a

00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,460
lot of talks today and I want to grab

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,099
your attention straight away so today

00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,899
I'm going to talk to you about what was

00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:26,189
good about moving from angular and what

00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:28,300
was really difficult as well so for me

00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:31,119
leave an angular was really really

00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,969
emotional I spent a year building an

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,920
angular app angular's is big big library

00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:38,260
that you spend a lot of time investing

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,060
about learning and so leaving that will

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,340
kind of like you don't want to start

00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,640
again but you have to do these things

00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:47,350
sometimes I'm so startling in so I'll in

00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,120
the reactor it did a couple of basic

00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:51,250
tutorials and I'm like I'm the master

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,350
react now this is easy and then you

00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,970
realize yeah I can't make an appt just

00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:58,570
with this I've got to learn all these

00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,280
other things I remember sort of looking

00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,030
at flux and someone shared with this

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,610
diagram and that didn't really help and

00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,850
then I remember going to work one day

00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,520
and I built less really basic react and

00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:15,760
flex up using the Facebook flux and the

00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,440
guys at work were like what no no one

00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,260
uses Facebook's flux what hell are you

00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,330
doing ah another one of those moments

00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,810
were definitely kind of confusing that

00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:29,500
start buffing the moment came for me

00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:31,150
when I realized that react is just a

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,950
view layer which is kind of confusing

00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:34,960
when you're first moving over because

00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,540
people talk about why you should use

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,020
react over angular but really they mean

00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:43,270
you should use react flux Redux reactor

00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,990
over angular and maybe I would have made

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:48,460
a bit simpler but I get only end and the

00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,970
shift in thinking was a big change as

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,619
well but not it took it took a long

00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,689
amount of time it's just actually it

00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:57,549
felt really good compared to this

00:01:55,689 --> 00:02:01,270
magical scope that you're updating and

00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:03,580
definitely felt better identify sis

00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,439
because I came from angular necessarily

00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,470
but I was doing it really really wrong

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,509
for a long time I had a lot of state in

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:12,310
my flux tours and a lot of state in my

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:14,019
components I member read an article

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,900
about a container components and that

00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:18,250
definitely cleared things up for me I'm

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,780
so a relation to things

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,750
I thought we're the same from angular

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,530
that sort of rang a bell for me I

00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:28,120
thought that react components definitely

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,550
reminded me of the angular view layer

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,780
and angular controllers in the sense of

00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,610
you've got a view layer that you're

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,110
calling methods I'm an angular you to

00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,550
call methods on your controller and a

00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:40,930
reactive calling methods from within

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,670
your component and reacts doors reminded

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,459
me of angular services or angular

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:49,120
factories in a sense as the place where

00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,610
all your stay is stored but now I

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:54,130
thought it'd only be nice to live on

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,750
that slide after the first slide and my

00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,310
big fan of react really enjoyed the

00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:59,790
talks today thank you very much for

00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,790
