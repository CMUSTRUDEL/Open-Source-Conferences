The ability to express essential complexity in a simple way is crucial for any code-base. At Mendix we did an interesting discovery during the development of a complex MDD tool. React, mutable data structures and transparent reactive programming are a match made in heaven. We published a library that leverages these concepts; Mobservable. It helps you to write simple, declarative, yet highly efficient code. Your future code maintainers will love you for applying it.

Michel is a full-stack lead developer at Mendix. A company that drives digital innovation in large enterprises in partnership with companies like HP, Capgemini and Pivotal.
