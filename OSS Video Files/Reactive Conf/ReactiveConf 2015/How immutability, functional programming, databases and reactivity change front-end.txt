Even though I believe programming UI can be made simple, right now, front-end is hard. We’re at the very beginning of our path to the future web: simple, error-prone, pleasant to use. In this talk, we’ll see how practices we have today in back-end programming, such as immutability, use of database engines, query languages and functional programming, can help us build JavaScript UIs. Examples include DataScript, Elm, Om, ClojureScript, Relay and more

For the past ten years Nikita Prokopov has been building web interfaces, backends and distributed systems in Clojure, Erlang, Python, Java.
