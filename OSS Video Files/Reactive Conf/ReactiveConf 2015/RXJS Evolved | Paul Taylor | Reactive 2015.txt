Description: 
	Reactive Extensions for JavaScript is evolving! Building on lessons learned from RxJava and RxMobile, Microsoft Netflix, Google, and the ReactiveX community have begun work on the next version of RxJS. This talk will enumerate the improvements we’ve made to increase speed, reduce memory, expose locations for extension, provide more debuggable call-stacks, and enable more readable flame charts.

Paul is a consultant in San Francisco, CA, and former lead engineer on FalcorJS on Netflix’sUI Platform team.
