Title: Victory.js - A powerful data visualization library for ReactJS - Colin Megill
Publication date: 2015-11-16
Playlist: ReactiveConf 2015
Description: 
	We tried swapped out D3's DOM model in favor of React. The result? Love at first iteration. Building a data visualization library as React components means that you can reclaim your SVG as declarative markup, NPM install visualizations directly into your project (can't do that with bl.ocks!), fork them, remix them and file issues against them. It also meant completely rethinking how animations are done, since D3's animation model relies on its DOM model. Come learn the API, and what it means for the future of interactive data visualization.
