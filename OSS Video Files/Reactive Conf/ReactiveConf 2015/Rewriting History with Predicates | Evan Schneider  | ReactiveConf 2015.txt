	00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:07,599
so two weeks ago I got the idea that I

00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:08,590
wanted to give lightning talk on

00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,549
something that I was playing around with

00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:15,039
I saw Dan Abrams talk on redux I thought

00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:16,269
it's very cool and of course I saw his

00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:19,170
dev tools which I thought were really

00:00:16,269 --> 00:00:22,780
interesting which led to this really

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,789
interesting idea of maybe you know you

00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,380
cured about redux today and maybe being

00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:27,670
able to capture all these actions and

00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:29,550
make use of them has some interesting

00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:32,920
possibilities that are like legitimate

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,780
to use an application so what I wanted

00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,329
to play around with was what happens

00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:40,539
when you basically always produce your

00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,589
state for your actions and of course I

00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:47,260
then had to do the obligatory to-do app

00:00:43,589 --> 00:00:51,489
so that's what I did so about that was

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,569
back in September two weeks ago I

00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:57,699
thought hey I have this to-do app I

00:00:52,569 --> 00:01:02,350
should talk about it so anyways closer

00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:04,080
that's better okay so I thought cool

00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,869
i'll travel to different complement i'll

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,810
do a demo where I like show how you can

00:01:07,869 --> 00:01:13,420
do this with drawing and I definitely

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:17,320
will not get distracted so I got here

00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,460
about four days ago anyways so what I

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,220
thought was interesting was just the

00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:26,620
ability to go back and change something

00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:28,030
and then go forward sure where the code

00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,070
is here but clearly you see doesn't

00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:36,730
actually stick anyways so the other demo

00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:38,170
that I had is here where what I wanted

00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,930
to do was take this ideas to a more

00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,880
applicable place so my entire idea is

00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,380
that you can be able to go back and

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,490
insert something and it'll either be

00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,850
able to affect the things in front of it

00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,920
or the thing behind it so the actual

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:53,080
static application in this actual state

00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,120
that your application is in is

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:58,330
determined pretty much at any point in

00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,100
time which allows for a few things that

00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,150
if you saw the Circle C article article

00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,100
about a year ago global state local

00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,780
concerns they demonstrated with closure

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:10,330
script and arm how you could basically

00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,680
see realize an app state and break it up

00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,819
somewhere else that's really cool there

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,280
are lots of debugging abilities if you

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:16,780
basically have your state be

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,010
serializable but if you have your action

00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,430
be serializable then you have the

00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,709
opportunity to sort of replay history so

00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,390
I really wanted to play around with what

00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:31,950
that allowed you to do hold on one

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:34,420
second so here we go there's canvas so

00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,799
unfortunately there were a lot of things

00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,040
that I tried to do here which I was not

00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:42,670
particularly capable of such as a lot of

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,989
time with canvas anyways so what I

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,640
wanted to show which is the ability to

00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:49,689
do summer race that was more interesting

00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:53,650
than just as you app but what I'm hoping

00:02:49,689 --> 00:02:57,250
to ultimately show with this is a okay

00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:00,970
well what I tell me show with this is

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,639
that there's a real opportunity to

00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:06,220
basically take this action pattern and

00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:08,829
take advantage of it to either send that

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:13,150
information back to the server or simply

00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:14,139
allow you to enter into like very

00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,190
different application states that would

00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:18,549
have been complicated before but are

00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:21,720
easy when you can simply change how you

00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:24,699
were routed there in the first place so

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,319
it's the built-in it's ultimately like

00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:27,669
fairly cheap there's only one problem

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,440
which is basically when you have to do

00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:32,230
any async work because that's naturally

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,190
side affecting so I have another version

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,310
of this to-do app that has a login which

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,269
anyways I don't have a link for that but

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,379
there are ways around that but there's

00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:44,859
just a lot of interesting opportunities

00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:48,639
that you have once you can move from one

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:52,629
place to another and begin to I guess

00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:56,739
change what you have see this code work

00:03:52,629 --> 00:04:00,840
is it working right now yeah cool it

00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:02,799
works it says watch evan that's me so

00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,269
it's not a practical it's not like a

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,739
very useful you I feature inner to-do

00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:07,989
app who the hell wants to go back and

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:08,919
change something like that but I think

00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,299
that there are a lot of opportunities

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,480
where actually just the ability to

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:18,180
change the course that you took to get

00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,180
