Description: 
	React's future is going to be more functional, and less OOP. What if that future is already reality? How would it look like? React's foundations are reactive rendering and UI as a pure function of state. These two foundations are reactive programming and functional programming, yet React has a lot of concepts from imperative programming. In this talk we will discover how Cycle.js is purely reactive and functional, and why it's an interesting alternative to React.

Andre is a user interface engineer at Futurice, with extensive knowledge in reactive programming.
