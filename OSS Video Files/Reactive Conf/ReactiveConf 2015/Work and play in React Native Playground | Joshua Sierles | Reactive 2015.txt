Description: 
	If you’re like me, coming from web development, you find traditional mobile development slow and difficult to learn hands-on without a lot of guesswork, headaches and patience. Above all, things just move slower. 
The React Native Playground breaks down barriers to mobile development by making it speedy and trivial to write and test React Native code across platforms and devices. I want to share my experience working with an amazing team on this free resource. 
First, I'll give a quick tour of what's possible with the Playground, showing off some of React Native itself. 
We’ll see how React Native’s unique architecture made this project possible, revealing some interesting details of its inner workings. For example, how we're serving React Native javascript code over the web, and how we can load an application from inside another one. 
Finally, I want to briefly discuss how working on project like this, which help developers learn faster, can be fun, rewarding and an antidote to programmer fatigue.

Joshua is React Native Playground and Rails/DevOps guy. Plays flamenco guitar in Sevilla, Spain, while working on a React Native development platform.

	00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,370
thank you

00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:15,429
so we should make sure this works great

00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:23,390
so I want to talk about Iraq native

00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:26,390
playground and about react native but

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:27,919
mainly I I want to leave two things in

00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,680
your head today and start a conversation

00:00:27,919 --> 00:00:32,390
not give a speech but start a

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,879
conversation about play and

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,710
experimentation because I think this is

00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:41,050
a really important thing in kind of work

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:44,420
that we do in fact two things play and

00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:45,800
speed development speed think these are

00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,380
two things that we have to constantly be

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,050
thinking about focusing on whenever we

00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,630
can with the kind of work that we do

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:58,700
because I think you know the work we do

00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,700
really allows us to change the world and

00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:03,620
I know how that sounds I'm not talking

00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:06,470
about Google Facebook change the world

00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,469
but dis dropping these this little drop

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,750
of water and seeing the ripple effect go

00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:14,000
out and then come back to us in in

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,190
unexpected ways this is what happened in

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,799
our experience building the react native

00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:21,590
playground and that's something I want

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,870
you all to kind of feel if I can express

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:30,729
myself well feel what we felt well we

00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:33,890
were building it a brief side it's 1996

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:35,900
anyone know what this is anyone seen

00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:42,280
this before early something like this

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:44,799
okay this is my first web design

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,659
and we'll come back to this later and

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,860
see exactly I won't tell you now what it

00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:50,520
has to do with the react native but

00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,900
there is a relation I did want to ask

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,950
how many of you actually have played

00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,050
with react native so far okay so a good

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,790
amount cool and the react native

00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:03,670
playground how many of you have actually

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,159
used it or seen it well not so many so

00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:09,220
that's good that means we're going to

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:14,260
get you all excited about it today so

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:19,720
yeah we'll come back to this one guess

00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:21,970
he on this guy in April 27 2015 wreck

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:25,000
native just come out and we were all on

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,760
chat talking about the possibility of

00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,850
getting sort of like a jsfiddle type

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,790
experience should be super easy to write

00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:36,730
said Christopher didn't turn out to be

00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,340
super easy but you know this is just

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,380
this crazy idea as an experiment it

00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,030
wasn't commissioned by Facebook or buy

00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,459
new one it was just an idea that we have

00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:50,290
something fun to play around with and

00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,540
you know how would we do this how does

00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,360
react native work to make something like

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,180
this possible the core concept it's

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,190
important to know is we're actually need

00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,510
javascript in a native environment but

00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:05,860
that means we can load that JavaScript

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:09,880
from anywhere even a URL so a first idea

00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,010
of to load this URL from a QR code on an

00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,420
app running on a phone that still meant

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,720
you had to compile this app on your

00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:19,690
phone still had to have a mac an iphone

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,030
but we got this to work managed to load

00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,760
a react native app inside of another app

00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:28,690
on a phone this was really cool this was

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,549
never possible before but no we had this

00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:32,530
dream we just wanted everything to load

00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,170
just have one URL could send out to

00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,989
anyone just like with jsfiddle or or the

00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,420
web in 1996 just sent out a URL and be

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,400
able to test the mobile app you know

00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:46,630
this also something that hasn't been

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,420
possible yet so fast forward to today

00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,220
and this is the rack native playground

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,819
so we're gonna see a little example of

00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,110
how how this works this is a game built

00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:58,540
by Alexander no sir

00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,760
no he's here if you are thank you for

00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,310
building this this cross platform

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,530
example this is a code editor we have on

00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,600
the site you can see over here we have

00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,910
some files for the Android and iOS

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:14,890
versions of this so now we can we're

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,760
loading nap here in a simulator running

00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:23,530
on the web we can play around with it

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,510
experiment and we can do it on iOS as

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,310
well both of these simulators are

00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,200
running right there on the web so it's

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,840
not a web view or anything like that

00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,180
there's an actual mobile simulator and

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,169
eating here this is the same code for

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:40,210
both iOS and Android so we can also go

00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:43,600
back to our old QR code and run this

00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:46,090
this is my iphone right here scan the

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,890
code and you can run the same lap right

00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,430
there on our device and get that native

00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:54,580
behavior pretty cool now so this this is

00:04:51,430 --> 00:05:00,160
you know what we were imagining and it

00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:02,440
in a heaven so just wanted to bring this

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,979
court out from friend of mine who's said

00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,630
this a lot and something that stuck in

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:10,330
my head all the time it's really

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:12,490
important about it's really related to

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,070
what we're talking about here today and

00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:17,200
that's the inspiration that we have to

00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:20,350
build things to get things out there in

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:22,660
the world it's perishable it has a has

00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,669
an expiration date so it's really

00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,460
important that we have tools that allow

00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:30,729
us to play around and also get things

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:32,530
out there as quick as possible I think

00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:37,169
this is something that we really should

00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:40,060
be focusing on for example one of the

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:42,190
biggest contributors take for examples

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:44,140
on the react native playground is the

00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,910
guy named Jason Brown who when he

00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,060
started out playing around with react

00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:51,010
native he didn't have a mac or an iPhone

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,810
which is what you needed to play around

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,510
with react native what does that mean

00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,430
that means you're cutting out a huge

00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:59,169
number of developers who only have a

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,910
little bit of time to play around and

00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,979
maybe their inspiration runs out they

00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,900
have to go back to work back to life and

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:07,450
they're never going to contribute to

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,680
this community but in this case he found

00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,630
the playground

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,600
and he learned how to build react native

00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,250
apps here and now he's one of the

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,720
biggest contributors of really cool

00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:28,600
examples things like this which this is

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:31,440
like an Instagram filter type app see

00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,440
how to get this thing running

00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:38,490
okay I think it actually is playing here

00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,990
so we're changing a value here can't

00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:45,610
really see this we're changing a value

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,499
here and the simulator over here is is

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,089
loading in real time the changes that

00:06:47,499 --> 00:06:51,550
we're making so wanted to show example

00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:52,839
of how that actually is possible using

00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,389
the playground so we can play around

00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:57,729
experiment with this code we can fork it

00:06:55,389 --> 00:06:59,589
we can make changes and play around with

00:06:57,729 --> 00:07:01,779
it there in the simulator has really

00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:03,849
cool that this guy maybe if you hadn't

00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:09,699
found this tool he would not be doing

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:13,839
react native today so this guy this guy

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:16,029
on the right here had this idea to get

00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,099
these simulators working on this on this

00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:19,870
site but you know this wasn't a we

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,719
didn't build that simulator this is an

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:25,389
extremely complex technology to make

00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:27,310
work and Brent here it's going to be

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:28,419
giving a great talk later today don't

00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:32,529
miss it if you're interested in react

00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:34,149
native he just said let's just write

00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,580
these guys have this online simulator

00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:40,360
and see if they give it to us for free I

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:42,580
said no that's hard sure why not that's

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,439
probably I was thinking now that's not

00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:46,839
gonna happen no just we'll just use the

00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:49,870
phones and erode the next day they wrote

00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:52,209
back said yeah let's do it we loved rec-

00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,490
we want to be part of the community you

00:07:52,209 --> 00:07:55,839
know this is again just getting stuff

00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,149
out there and showing you the people

00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,490
gets people excited and gets all these

00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:03,039
ripple effects that go out and then then

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,580
come back in unexpected ways and this

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,800
this really made the playground possible

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,180
well we have today so I want to shout

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,099
out for these guys is really cool

00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:14,050
product that they have and you should

00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,969
check it out and be it's great for doing

00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:21,879
product demos anything you want with

00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:23,709
mobile you can do on the web I'm not

00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:25,779
going to cover this too much I just

00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:27,520
wanted to reiterate that the way that

00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:29,080
rack NATO works is there's a bridge

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,629
between the native environment on

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:34,000
Android and iOS and a JavaScript

00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:35,829
execution environment and the transfer

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,589
of code between these two can happen

00:08:35,829 --> 00:08:40,659
over many channels including over the

00:08:38,589 --> 00:08:42,250
internet which is how the react native

00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:46,209
play round works let me try to explain

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:48,130
here it's this crazy diagram of how this

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,680
works and it was kind of an insane idea

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:51,760
but again just trying an insane idea and

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,910
seeing that it actually works better

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:58,540
than you expected is a great way to get

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:00,850
stuff out there in the world so what we

00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:05,440
do to make the playground work we build

00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:07,900
a native rack native app which is just

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,780
full of community modules modules for

00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,080
accessing the camera gps maps things

00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:18,190
that are actually make using native apps

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,050
more fun and we host them on emphasize

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,110
service which are actually max and linux

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:26,020
box is running out there in the cloud

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:30,160
and they send a jpeg image stream to the

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:32,110
browser and then in the browser this you

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:37,990
actually on their servers we pass any

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:40,330
URL to to the javascript react native

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,190
packager that's running on our servers

00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,280
so let me explain a little bit of what

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:46,720
that means that means that on our server

00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,740
here and this little tree of

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,010
applications we're running a single

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,870
development node server that watches for

00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,230
changes and all the files in the apps

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,330
and pushes them back down to to the

00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:03,580
browser which allows us to update the

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,290
app in real time and this is kind of

00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:06,580
crazy that this actually works because

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,110
this was not designed for this this

00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,870
package or the thing that you run in

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,850
development when you're developing apps

00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,190
and we're running this in a production

00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,660
environment on a service probably using

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:19,630
3 4 gigs of memory and it's actually

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,460
working great for this purpose this is

00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:23,800
no long term solution but it was good

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:27,460
enough to get it out there and be really

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,850
useful to a lot of people some examples

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:34,450
of how the playground has is become

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:37,360
really useful I'm is in things like pull

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,460
request for react native species quite a

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,870
lot in pull request to to actually

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,490
observe behavior with bugs and issues

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:48,190
but also we had this idea that we could

00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,830
embed directly in the rack native

00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,480
documentation and we've done this we

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,370
just have one example working now but we

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,589
want to get them all out there you guys

00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:59,140
can help that with that please let me

00:10:56,589 --> 00:11:00,899
know but now right there in the

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,420
documentation you can just click on this

00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:05,519
emulator and you can run one of the

00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:08,819
official examples and you can see here

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,360
this is the alert iOS component that

00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:13,529
just works right there in the browser so

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,149
we want to keep doing more things like

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,149
the experiments getting stuff out there

00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:23,100
talk a little bit about the future of

00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,860
what the playground is going to do

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:28,439
hopefully and I want you guys to help us

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,160
out with this we'd like to host official

00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:34,230
native modules so the native modules

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,720
that are out there have examples but

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,429
it's also again to get that on to your

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,470
machine and compile it and test out

00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:42,389
those examples it takes up time that you

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:46,110
could be using to actually develop stuff

00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:48,660
so we like to host all of these modules

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:50,759
official examples and have them updated

00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,800
regularly so this is something that

00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:56,189
again you want to help out with let us

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,220
know summit told me this morning they're

00:11:56,189 --> 00:12:00,480
using the playground to do workshops in

00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,689
tutorials some of the workshops that

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,209
were happening here at this conference

00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:08,100
of course i was told that while some

00:12:06,209 --> 00:12:10,220
people were downloading the android sdk

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:13,050
other people were developing apps and

00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,019
finishing the workshop on on the

00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,579
playground so again development speed is

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:23,429
a crucial thing in so many different

00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:26,459
environments another interesting thing

00:12:23,429 --> 00:12:28,589
about something like the playground is

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:31,110
that you can now that you can have

00:12:28,589 --> 00:12:34,079
mobile apps online and so distribute

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,240
them this way without putting them on a

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,209
app store having some other kind of

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,839
distribution system you can get feedback

00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:44,819
much quicker than you would in another

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,920
in the traditional mobile development

00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:50,730
environment so this is an idea that we

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:55,019
had to extend the playground into a

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:58,799
product that would allow us to do QA and

00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:01,170
staging of react native applications but

00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,779
of course you know this this seems like

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,429
quite an ambitious project but again

00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:07,860
react natives architecture is really

00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:10,350
made in such a way that we could we

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:13,170
built a prototype of this only in a

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:13,740
couple weeks using another technique

00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:16,650
which

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,920
is something that seemed kind of crazy

00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:23,820
idea but it actually works pretty well

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,830
react native app is just just a giant

00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:27,780
component right and at this top level

00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,180
component we can actually wrap this

00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:34,260
component in another component which has

00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:38,100
its own behavior so for example if we

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:40,230
want to give feedback on a nap get and

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,300
put a sort of an annotator screenshot on

00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:44,910
top of this app we can do this by

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,670
injecting code on our service so when

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,190
somebody gives us one of their react

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:52,890
native apps we can build its JavaScript

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,530
and inject another component around

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:57,120
their application giving us all this

00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:59,010
behavior without the developer having

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,560
even think about this another thing that

00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,470
before was pretty much impossible to do

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:07,100
I just wanted to give a quick demo what

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:11,970
we're doing here on this product we have

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,770
we can select multiple devices and can

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:15,960
rotate as well something we're not doing

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:18,060
it on the playground but also we do want

00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:20,150
to get in place and we can do something

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:22,980
like this when we take a screenshot and

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,540
the feedback right here in this

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,220
environment something that's missing

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:28,860
from the playground this extra step of

00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,770
being able to get feedback from QA teams

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,650
and so on and then we can we can view

00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:37,980
this feedback here pass it on to a boss

00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:40,170
or a customer and really bring really

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,800
close this looping and make development

00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:45,960
faster and in the native environment we

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,090
actually shared a lot of this code and

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:50,550
made it work almost the same way right

00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:52,230
right here on the iphone with a very

00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,330
minimal effort using this same technique

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:59,280
which was only made possible because of

00:14:54,330 --> 00:15:01,590
the rack native architecture so what I'm

00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:04,320
trying to emphasize here is that a lot a

00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,110
lot of this stuff was built very quickly

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,330
by very small team of people were really

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:11,670
enthusiastic about this because it was

00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:14,280
new and finding it was an experiment it

00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:17,880
wasn't it's the same old thing so I

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:20,850
encourage all of you to bring out as

00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,590
much of this energy as you have and how

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,740
much time as you can to put into these

00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:26,449
kinds of projects that aren't not just

00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:28,639
in

00:15:26,449 --> 00:15:30,199
proving open source libraries and things

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,730
like that which of course is ensuring

00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:35,299
the important work but also sprinting

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:37,759
out a little bit and thinking and in how

00:15:35,299 --> 00:15:41,959
you can hack things up and make them

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:43,999
work in different ways I would said I

00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,089
would come back to this you know the

00:15:43,999 --> 00:15:49,429
reason I I brought this up was you know

00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:51,589
I built this site not having any idea

00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:53,269
what I was doing back then and kind of

00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:55,339
it just passed into history and didn't

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,779
think much about it obviously I didn't

00:15:55,339 --> 00:15:58,309
show it to many people because now

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:01,519
looking back at her she's kind of

00:15:58,309 --> 00:16:04,009
embarrassing all this alien stuff

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,889
hackers aliens in our thoughts back then

00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:08,809
I thought that was amazing thing but you

00:16:06,889 --> 00:16:13,249
know just passed into history and then I

00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:15,649
don't know if anyone's seen has anyone

00:16:13,249 --> 00:16:18,169
seen this show I'm not someone to plug

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:21,379
TV shows this is a really cool TV show

00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:23,389
about a computer hacker because it tells

00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:25,790
truth about the way that developers

00:16:23,389 --> 00:16:31,850
think and hackers work but there was one

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:34,519
particular episode where this guy was

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,410
talking about how he learned to code and

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,239
how he learned to make websites things

00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:41,779
like that and I saw him go to this site

00:16:38,239 --> 00:16:43,910
that I built back then and do view

00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:46,100
source so he's viewing source on this

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:48,709
signed it made me think you know this is

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,929
you know crazy that thing was a system

00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:53,389
site that was up there and it didn't

00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:55,549
really matter to anyone maybe back then

00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:57,889
but just passed into history but it

00:16:55,549 --> 00:17:01,309
stuck in someone's mind and then it came

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:03,259
back to me through this dish TV show and

00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,699
on this this is what I'm talking about

00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:06,889
it like just getting stuff out there

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:09,889
even stuff like that design that I put

00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:11,419
up there it's it it has these unexpected

00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:15,500
effects that ripple out through the

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:18,230
world and and I really want I'm really

00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:23,720
hope that you guys can feel that that

00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:25,730
same kind of energy so there's another

00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,199
thing that I saw it was interesting a

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:31,130
couple of weeks ago related to all of

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,159
this this is a CEO github who I know

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,230
from the Ruby community way back who had

00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:40,010
worked on maybe 20 other apps before

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:42,230
working at github he worked on 14 mm

00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:44,960
adding a family pastebin social

00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:46,970
networking sites week is but all that

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,090
experience all that hacking and

00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,190
experimenting it was valuable when they

00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,890
started building github now all of this

00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:57,590
experience was extremely useful because

00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:01,550
they could build servers they could hack

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:03,830
around in a low level had on the web and

00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:05,870
mobile all the dis experience that just

00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,520
seemed like maybe not directly related

00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:10,610
to the work they were doing at the time

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,790
all of it was what made github possible

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:15,950
and and made our social code revolution

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,740
possible today it's another great

00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:28,090
example of how important experimentation

00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:32,210
and play is so I really wanted to just

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:34,580
say that all of us are responsible for

00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,080
making our community better we're all

00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,500
have a shared responsibility in this

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,510
whether or not we consume or produce

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,580
we're all responsible at some point to

00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,370
contribute and I think this is something

00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:48,530
that maybe it seems like I'm preaching

00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:49,760
to the open-source choir but when L

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,980
there's a lot of people out there who

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:54,530
had these ideas but they don't get them

00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,940
out there and I just want you to get

00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:58,190
them out there if you're excited about

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,830
react native please come talk to me

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,950
honey one else on the react native team

00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,840
and talk to us about this and help us

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:08,000
out with with these kinds of tools and

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,370
make them better I just want to thank

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,530
these guys the the team that kind of

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,460
rallied around the site and and built it

00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:18,860
up and now I just want to get go to some

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,230
questions because I think it's important

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:25,280
that you talk to me and we have a little

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:29,180
discussion so check out the rec native

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,540
playground here my site and our feedback

00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,540
product

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,970
so let's take see the questions can we

00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:46,440
use the mobile simula on the web to run

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:48,480
code from localhost not how we have it

00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,430
set up today what is it certainly

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,590
possible there's tools like any rock or

00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:54,870
another really cool hacker tool which

00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,600
has for us if we're developing this has

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,100
been extremely useful this is by the way

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,320
I just you should mention it's the react

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,090
native playground the entire source code

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:06,210
base is open source it's a rails

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:08,100
application fronted by react and some

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:10,800
other funky stuff in there some docker

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:14,640
containers for running these the node

00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:16,590
servers and yeah we can use if you run

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,790
it and local host you can use that now

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,370
to do that you can actually run the

00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,500
entire playground there and run and

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,810
point the simulator to your integral

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,990
which is a tool for tunneling traffic

00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:29,730
into into your local machine but it's

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,840
something we like to support in in the

00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:35,490
future on the site as well does Apple

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,210
seal the Scourge app that load bundles

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:40,890
on everything from a server actually

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:43,920
this hasn't been a problem in all

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:47,190
there's there's some 30-something apps I

00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,110
think on the on the app store now and

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:53,010
quite a few of them and big ones as well

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:55,620
are are using various services to push

00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,850
code down and they're doing it now and

00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:59,190
it's happening and it hasn't been a

00:20:56,850 --> 00:21:00,600
problem for anyone and probably

00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,930
something that will prove that this is

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,250
going to be a long-term viable solution

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,980
and it's not going to be cut off by

00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:10,440
Apple is that Microsoft just released as

00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:16,200
a tool that does this as well so

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:18,240
microsoft is offering a free a free what

00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,030
we call it I don't know what we call it

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,740
it's a command line tool and a server

00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:24,150
back-end so basically it's the

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,980
deployment environment where you can

00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:28,290
push your coat up to their service and

00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,520
we'll update your your app on a manner

00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:31,620
so this is already happening out there

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,850
and and I just see that a future is

00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,380
going to be more and more stuff like

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,450
this so I don't think this should be a

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:39,480
concern for you today if you want if

00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:41,280
you're relying on this also a really

00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,500
amazing thing that we can do with react

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,740
native it's possible to use installable

00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:51,620
NPM dependencies in playground good

00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,320
something I forgot to mention we start

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,940
have a semi experimental but working

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,010
feature where you can actually push a

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,200
git repository right up to the

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:03,440
playground will install your mpm the

00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,390
dependencies for you and your Apple will

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,760
be running there so like adapt that you

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,530
saw just before with the game that app

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,850
is actually a git repository with you

00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,100
could see there were quite a lot of

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,780
files up there so that was pushed up and

00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,640
you can just make push changes and

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,800
they'll get updated on the site so yes

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,410
you can install dependencies as long as

00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,330
they don't contain any native code which

00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,830
would have to be compiled into the iOS

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,330
or Android app of course that's

00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:28,429
something we love to also support in the

00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:31,070
future is doing custom builds of those

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:32,600
kinds for more complicated apps but

00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:34,940
today as long as your end of NPM

00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:40,309
dependencies are just JavaScript based

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:44,020
they will work how do you manage to run

00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:46,550
iOS and Android simulators at scale

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:50,480
since we're not actually managing that

00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:53,300
and up till now the great guy that

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,910
advertised or i/o have let us run this

00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:57,260
at the scale that we have which I think

00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:58,730
for them is actually pretty small they

00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,260
have quite a lot of big customers

00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:01,730
running on their servers and they have

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:04,880
multiple data centers all over the world

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:08,540
so right now scale is not an issue for

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,640
us and but for them it's a good question

00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:12,950
and something that I want to talk to

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,660
them more about and find out what how

00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:16,610
does I really work how is it possible

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,800
you can have these simulators running on

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:21,740
these servers and and run them at scale

00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:25,910
right it's a good question I will find

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:29,090
out more about that and those aren't

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,429
play support hot reloading so what it's

00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,150
doing now is a live reload which is just

00:23:31,429 --> 00:23:37,010
reloading the JavaScript the entire app

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,470
poetry loadings I think is what you're

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:42,410
referring to here is is reloading like

00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:45,110
like hot reloading on react web there

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:47,600
are as long as your JavaScript

00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:49,309
environment supports it right now we

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,070
don't support it because we can't we're

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:54,110
not running you have to run web pack

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,929
which is the only environment right now

00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,870
that supports the hot reloading of that

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:01,370
kind so you would have to run we would

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:02,570
have to run a web back server we don't

00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:04,580
support that today but

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,639
certainly something good in the future

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:09,289
once we are running once we were able to

00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:11,090
run something other than the default to

00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:13,610
react native packages what is what which

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,679
is what we run today so something we

00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:19,850
could definitely support but not we're

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:23,870
not quite there yet windows phone

00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:25,519
support no plans because as appetizer io

00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,320
doesn't support it and those are the

00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,149
guys who gave us that but if somebody

00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,200
builds a Windows Phone simulator then

00:24:29,149 --> 00:24:34,879
why not but of course we reckon aided is

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,379
going to have to support it windows

00:24:34,879 --> 00:24:42,049
phones I think are able to run android

00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:43,850
apps now so as there's a possibility

00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:48,169
that that could be supported on the

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:53,000
playground at some point are the native

00:24:48,169 --> 00:24:56,240
modules what disappeared do you have

00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,919
plans to monetize this not the

00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,889
playground itself because I think it's

00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,690
really important that tools like that

00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:04,879
are always free and always out there

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,159
because the things we get back from the

00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:09,919
people that use it is much more valuable

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,720
than what we could monetize off of this

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,809
platform in particular what we are doing

00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,909
is monetizing the feedback platform that

00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,860
I showed you a little demo of if you go

00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:20,240
to replay that I owe you can sign up for

00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:23,149
a beta which hopefully will have out

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,710
soon what we're hoping is take the ideas

00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:26,659
on the playground perfect to them in

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,950
that environment and then bring some of

00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:32,590
those back so we can do things like

00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:36,049
custom iOS builds in the playground are

00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:39,769
the native modules conceptually similar

00:25:36,049 --> 00:25:43,279
to Cordova plugins in a sense a nap

00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:46,600
talks to device via JavaScript native

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:49,399
bridge I think about that for a second

00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,039
yes they're conceptually similar the

00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:54,590
interface is quite different and my

00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,899
opinion is much cleaner I never done iOS

00:25:54,590 --> 00:26:00,529
programming I was working with Ruby

00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:01,879
motion before coming to Iraq native so I

00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:03,980
understood the API but hadn't worked

00:26:01,879 --> 00:26:05,870
with Objective C and and writing I had

00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:08,360
to write in module for audio recording

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:09,919
and I found it quite simple there's some

00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:12,710
great examples from Brent which really

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:16,010
helped me out but the environment itself

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,410
is it's a very small and very clear API

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,650
we

00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:22,020
well documented and how to to work with

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,270
this bridge so yeah the concept is

00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:29,100
similar but the interface is I think

00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:32,400
very superior it's possible to embed a

00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,100
playground app in a website certainly

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,600
possible but just we're not sure yet if

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,150
that's something we can support because

00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,130
we have to be careful with the the usage

00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,810
numbers we have from appetizers so it's

00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:46,740
something we're talking about to figure

00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:48,450
out what kind of usage we could allow

00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,000
because maybe we don't want to have

00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,680
product demos things like that but for

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,510
open source I think that's definitely

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,340
what we would like to support for

00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:59,190
example some people who are doing

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,570
examples on the cider want to blog they

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,190
want to post it on their blog which is

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,780
makes perfect sense where they're

00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:05,280
explaining what they're building up

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:12,030
there so hopefully we'll be able to

00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:18,390
support that soon so one minutes can I

00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:20,640
run cycle jas apps I have no idea so I

00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:27,300
don't know maybe brain can answer that
