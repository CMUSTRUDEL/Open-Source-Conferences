Description: 
	With the push towards writing CSS in JavaScript within the React community, CSS Modules have suddenly emerged as a surprisingly popular alternative that still allow us to maintain our connection with the CSS community. 

Do we have to give up writing CSS in JavaScript? Are we clinging to the past, or do CSS Modules offer a new way forward for the entire web community? In this talk we'll examine both the history and potential future of CSS Modules, and hopefully inspire the next generation of styling in React.

Mark Dalgleish is the co-creator of CSS Modules, lead organiser of MelbJS and progressive enhancement enthusiast.
