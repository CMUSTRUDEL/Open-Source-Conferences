so I'm a layman I'm from reindex and I'm

00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:13,450
going to talk about rapid prototyping

00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:16,750
with relay or more generally just

00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:22,090
building products quickly and iterating

00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:26,800
them on them fast so I'm going to talk

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:30,730
about the stack of tools that I ended up

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:35,380
for this but first I'm going to delete

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:38,230
how and end it there so this is how a

00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:40,990
stack for an app that I was working on a

00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,960
year ago looked like as you can see we

00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:46,570
were using react on the front end which

00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:50,770
turns out to be very awesome for rapid

00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:53,470
iteration most of the design even was

00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:56,980
done directly and react component we're

00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:59,140
using flux and then the front end use

00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:03,059
dress to dock with the back end that was

00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:07,210
like freely state-of-art built with

00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:13,060
microservices and all that stuff by a

00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:16,870
super team so building recombinants was

00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,240
fast but working on this back-end was

00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:24,130
not so every time we had to build a new

00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,870
feature it took a lot of time and it was

00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,900
since the backend was built by a

00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:30,729
separate team with different tools there

00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:36,190
was also like a lot of communication

00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:40,420
overhead to communicate the requirements

00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:42,659
for the back end so we replaced the back

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:46,750
end with the backend SEO service

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:50,799
firebase as that Thomas talked about

00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:53,080
earlier and we also used another service

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,369
called El golea with like search as a

00:01:53,080 --> 00:02:01,450
service and this was very very nice

00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:03,610
because it allowed the product people

00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,150
like the product developers to build

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,519
everything for a single feature and it

00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,480
allowed us to move faster but once this

00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:16,260
bottleneck was removed we noticed that

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,140
there was another one in the middle ah

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,610
because

00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,760
writing all the stores for

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:30,010
different kinds of data and using rest

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:36,160
to rest api's to synchronize it was not

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:38,890
was not ideal and honest as thomas

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,430
mentioned in the firebase talk they were

00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:48,780
there were multiple round trips required

00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:51,840
and we had the same problem and so a

00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:57,930
solution to the problem in the middle

00:02:51,840 --> 00:03:00,430
was came from developers at facebook

00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:02,490
when early this year they started

00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:06,490
talking about relay and graphical and

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:10,450
graphical is a query language and a type

00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:12,220
system that lets the server expose its

00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:16,150
capabilities and then the client can

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:20,200
query are the server the data that it

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:24,370
needs and the relay is a library for

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:26,920
react that lets you describe these data

00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:30,490
needs in react components and it will

00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:32,710
handle fetching it for you but then the

00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,080
question was what shall we use us back

00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:40,830
end because firebase doesn't support

00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:44,350
craft cool so that's when I said that if

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,080
someone doesn't build this we're going

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,870
to need to build this ourselves so me

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,140
and my co-founder quit doing client

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:58,330
projects and build a craft wheel back

00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:01,900
end as a service called reindex and the

00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:06,730
way that it works is that it allows you

00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:09,370
to build built fast because you know I

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:16,600
wanted something that's as easy to set

00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:18,670
up as 5 a's and but it also should allow

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,320
you to change things without breaking

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:27,330
things so once you move past like the

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,070
first prototype it should be possible to

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:31,900
do a bulb the application without

00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:34,840
without breaking stuff

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:39,610
graphical can help with this because it

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,199
has a schema that that tells you if

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,350
you're trying to get the field that

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:52,120
doesn't exist or trying to put something

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:55,289
in the database that's invalid and this

00:04:52,120 --> 00:05:00,340
is how you use it you just install a

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:04,000
command-line tool you write a schema in

00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:07,930
this kind of JSON format and then you

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,680
just push it to the server and the and

00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:14,919
the craft google api gets created for

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,500
you and then you can start making

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:24,070
queries like this is the tool called

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:30,669
graphical which is very nice like this

00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:38,410
is for all the events in reactive

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:40,810
conference and there was a contest to

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:43,930
build an app for reactive conference and

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:47,550
actually one developer used this stack

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,590
that I just told about to build an app

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,669
and this is we're done with react native

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:59,979
it's like this pretty awesome you can

00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:02,370
find the code for this and get help add

00:05:59,979 --> 00:06:02,370
