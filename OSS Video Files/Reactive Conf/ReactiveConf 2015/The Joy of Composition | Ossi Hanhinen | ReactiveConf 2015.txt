great every hello everyone I'm Austin

00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:21,949
Hanlon so two things about myself I can

00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:24,529
do this and I've been coding I've been

00:00:21,949 --> 00:00:26,509
coding elm for production for past half

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:29,390
a year and I've never actually used to

00:00:26,509 --> 00:00:32,150
react but thanks for voting for me for

00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,940
this reacts conference so my talk is

00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:39,530
titled joy of composition why stateless

00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:41,660
rendering is pure bliss now meet joy

00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,719
she's a front that devil pro like you

00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,410
and me and she has this great new idea

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,859
she's going to be able to get hug and

00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:54,829
decide to use react for it so she just

00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:57,890
starts hacking away and in the beginning

00:00:54,829 --> 00:01:00,530
she's very content the code is very

00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:04,160
elegant Maurice it really simple or any

00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:07,100
readable but as time goes on she adds a

00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:11,509
little event handling logic there and a

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:13,729
little life cycle over there and she

00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:17,750
soon finds herself in this never-ending

00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:20,240
swamp of jsx and she's struggling know

00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:24,049
where the components and start and when

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,299
they end and what they depend on but

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:31,850
what's worse she doesn't know where the

00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:34,820
state lives anymore so she takes a

00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,560
little breather a moment of Zen she

00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,880
tries to figure out what went wrong from

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:44,540
the very beginning now here's HTML for

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,909
you the structure here depicts a very

00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:50,930
simple menu as you can see but already

00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:52,939
we can see the problem there's very deep

00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,049
nesting even in this very trivial

00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:59,899
example so deep nesting is bad because

00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:03,079
it obviously makes you didn't code less

00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:07,070
readable but there's other problems as

00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,920
well we are used to binding the data and

00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:12,950
the structure of page which basically

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,840
means the UI together up to the point

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:18,560
where we are actually repeating

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,330
ourselves now there's a lot of ways to

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,730
and solve some of these problems like

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,099
angular repeats and massage template

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,080
repeats and stuff like that but also

00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:31,370
there's the functional ways of doing

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,830
that like the array map map function so

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:36,800
joy decides to take a look at the UI

00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:39,440
from another point of view she figures

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,620
if I only had this solid block of data

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,110
that's read-only I could just pass it

00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:50,180
down to a function that takes it and

00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:53,060
returns the corresponding HTML and doing

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:55,610
so she could just delegate stuff from

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,330
there she could have a render header

00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:03,349
that takes stuff regarding the header

00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:08,120
and maybe just render menu menu item or

00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:10,190
even just an item link so since the days

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:15,080
of was read-only none of the functions

00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:18,790
could actually alter that data state so

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:22,549
that means there's no weird state ever

00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:26,900
render is essentially as a pure function

00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:30,769
from the state to HTML now so this also

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,900
brings composability so joy can start

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:36,410
working on the prototype using just the

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,260
render app function but as time goes on

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:42,650
she can explain it to rendering the main

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:44,690
panel and the side panel but she can

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,519
also split those up any number of times

00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:52,100
and it doesn't matter it's just function

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,799
she can also combine functional the

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:59,269
utilities like lodash or whatever to do

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,100
the rendering and she doesn't have to

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:04,870
worry about the whole UI at the same

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,970
time so she can focus on the component

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,859
now here's a quote from a friend of mine

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:13,579
who's sitting and sitting right there

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:17,750
and going to present tomorrow most UI

00:04:13,579 --> 00:04:20,690
code should look small it's actually a

00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:24,940
cold smell if you have jsx with lots of

00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:27,710
nesting so joy comes to this conclusion

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:29,780
if you're working on a drop-down menu

00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:31,620
you shouldn't actually be thinking about

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:36,630
how to render a single item

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:40,530
menu so left with these pure thoughts

00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:43,590
she's founders in and for her second

00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:47,490
next project she died decides to go all

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:50,729
functional and maybe go for cycle j/s

00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,949
and hyper script helpers instead hyper

00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:57,590
scripts helpers is actually a project of

00:04:52,949 --> 00:05:01,889
my own it's made makes writing vide on

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:04,289
basically simple functions and of course

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:08,720
you could go all the way and use elm or

00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:11,550
closure script instead so that's it I

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,830
Mohan he on twitter and github please

00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:16,050
feel free to poke me real life or

00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:20,330
virtually if you have any questions or

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,330
