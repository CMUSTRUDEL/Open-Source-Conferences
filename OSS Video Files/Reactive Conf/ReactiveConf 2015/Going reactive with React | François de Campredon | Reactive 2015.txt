Title: Going reactive with React | François de Campredon | Reactive 2015

Description: 
	In the past two years, React and all the related projects completely changed our way of creating application by breaking all the rules and forcing us to redefine what we thought being "best practice". However, there is still an area that has not changed much : how we define the relationship between user input and application state. In this talk, I'll try to demonstrate that we can express this relationship in a simpler and more declarative way by using techniques from reactive programing and by combining React with RxJS.

François is a Full-stack developer and co-founder of Fadio IT, JavaScript lover, creator of rx-react.
