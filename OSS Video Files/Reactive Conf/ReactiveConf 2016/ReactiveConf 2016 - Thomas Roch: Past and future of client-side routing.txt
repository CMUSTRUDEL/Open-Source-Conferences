Thomas Roch: Past and future of client-side routing

MVC frameworks made single page applications a lot more accessible to front end developers. Routing is a key feature of MVC frameworks, enabling view and URL changes without a full page reload. It has shaped a vision of routing which is specific to MVC frameworks. Nowadays, with functional and reactive programming influences, dedicated view libraries, and more runtime environments available (server-side rendering and native apps), routing is starting to look a lot different. This talk will give an overview of how routing used to look, and how it is likely to look like going ahead.
