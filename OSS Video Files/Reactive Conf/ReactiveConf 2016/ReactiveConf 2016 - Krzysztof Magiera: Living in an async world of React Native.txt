Krzysztof Magiera: Living in an async world of React Native

React Native’s asynchronous model of bridging between UI code written in JS and the UI thread that runs most of the native code has many advantages to the app users. But in same cases it may become a developer’s nightmare to deal with, especially when it comes to complex touch interactions, animations or "that damned AsyncStorage". In my talk I’ll be giving some tips on how to not get lost in the asynchronous world of React Native app development. We will discuss some common mistakes and important app and library design principles that are imposed by the asynchronous nature of the bridge.
