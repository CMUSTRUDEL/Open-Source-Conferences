Krzysztof Magiera: Living in an async world of React Native

React Native’s asynchronous model of bridging between UI code written in JS and the UI thread that runs most of the native code has many advantages to the app users. But in same cases it may become a developer’s nightmare to deal with, especially when it comes to complex touch interactions, animations or "that damned AsyncStorage". In my talk I’ll be giving some tips on how to not get lost in the asynchronous world of React Native app development. We will discuss some common mistakes and important app and library design principles that are imposed by the asynchronous nature of the bridge.

Have you heard about ReactiveConf? According to tech superstars such as David Nolen, Richard Feldman, or Brent Vatne, it’s the best conference on web and mobile app development! It focuses on all things React and beyond and takes place annually in Bratislava, Slovakia.

In 2016, more than 700 attendees from all over the world spent three days in Bratislava getting inspired, sharing amazing new ideas, and meeting more than 30 awesome speakers from companies such as Google, Cognitect, NoRedInk, RethinkDB, Airbnb, Microsoft, Facebook, and the list could go on forever.

If you want to be part of the next event, get your tickets now at https://reactiveconf.com, and React with us!

I work at a separate agency and also I

00:00:12,299 --> 00:00:18,119
mentioned that in fact there are 30

00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:20,730
people not in use we have been related

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,369
if Limoges in many art projects and so

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,259
prior to that I was Facebook working in

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:26,550
the great native quarter my team almost

00:00:25,259 --> 00:00:29,399
systematic started

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:33,750
I love December last year and since then

00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:35,579
some are contributing to some extent so

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,070
my area of expertise is related in the

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,140
public mind focused at me about today

00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,240
this is a basically switch from being

00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,370
like a framework that Walker to more

00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:46,920
love more comic products and also

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,500
mentoring other people who use magnetic

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,460
for the first time I started noticing

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,230
the common source of confusion when it

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,210
comes recommended as the asynchronous

00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:58,950
nature of the gratitude

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,960
so today I'm going to talk about some

00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,210
common patterns or dealing with issues

00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,519
that are induced by the asynchronous

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,579
nature and the design implementation

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,380
with great metaphor I'm sure we're gonna

00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:13,710
see a lot I'm kind of assuming that you

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:18,389
know a little about native already so

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,249
this is like a little more for how I'm

00:01:18,389 --> 00:01:23,189
gonna be talking about the interaction

00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:24,420
between the threads in right manner on

00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,039
the left hand side you had a job for

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,189
friend which is fun the JavaScript code

00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:32,069
at end of our business and there is a

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,719
URL which is like the main application

00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:37,259
for that channel so that you could and

00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,299
also responsible for or rendering

00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,159
native use and then difference is kind

00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:43,469
of in the middle and it's possible

00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:53,130
pretending that you in DC be spoon and

00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:55,649
also for work our way into layout you

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,840
want to build an app that it's a user

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:59,130
the my son boarding experience whenever

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,099
they want together for the first time

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,349
they see the alerting screen and they

00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:06,569
have already video boarding then they

00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:11,280
can like start movie that may not

00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:13,440
community you can start in like an

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,060
office part and then we're gonna read it

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,530
at the beginning and then decided

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,530
pending on the results you can either

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,280
under the main application or render

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,980
view on loading book on my own you know

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,650
there is no I can

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:30,689
version before cost are taken on

00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,159
retainer and this the reason of course

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,890
is being a chicken is nature elaborate

00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:39,030
so there's a alternative in here that's

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,829
called a sea start and this is how the

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,730
interaction where the ISA starts would

00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:46,170
look like on the on this work track the

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,000
search on the traffic threat you're

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,129
gonna ask the exome starts to get the

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,719
night time with a beginner key it's

00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:54,629
gonna go to the native thread that runs

00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,290
the native modules and then it will

00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:57,290
actually return

00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:53,700
it's also convenient actually volume so

00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:54,659
this first button don't a synchronous

00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,370
version of the bridge is actually

00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:59,430
commonly used in the resonator for

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,700
example 14 what do this co-op state that

00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,530
works by exploring by creating a

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,630
separate native model that then you can

00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,919
use to export constants the drastic so

00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:09,870
these constants are loaded on the

00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,470
certify in the not accessible

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,470
synchronously

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,690
Android using these methods in your

00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,479
native moto and used again constant

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,970
method to return a list of things you

00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:25,530
want to access from the aspect in the

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:28,680
new JavaScript to use the native modules

00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:30,479
module to require your and to get the

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,100
reference to that end to the constants

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,419
and then whenever you want to get the

00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,000
item you just get them synchronously

00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,740
from wherever you have from the copy

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,970
that you have in the JavaScript p.m. and

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,440
then when you said it you said it

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,090
synchronously understand enhancing

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:48,180
Station update to the error model except

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:50,539
as the screen orientation sitter there's

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,800
one marina scoring native orientation

00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:54,800
helps with handling orientation changes

00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:30,570
so this is this is a new solution for

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:33,900
for in many cases where you were just

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:36,590
interested in the orientation you have

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,090
but you can actually find to do

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,580
different experience depending on the

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,980
orientation if human getting that

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:45,050
imagine you have to apps like mana that

00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:47,810
has two versions of it depending on if

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,700
you're in landscape or in imported so

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,470
important you have a list of items and

00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,770
then when you flip the landscape you

00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:56,210
have like like a viewpager that in flip

00:05:54,770 --> 00:06:00,350
between the slides and if you see my

00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:01,910
school's in picture so what happens when

00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:05,420
the orientation change comes through the

00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:08,090
year the reference and the advantage are

00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:10,460
different right so in the neon that if

00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,920
if the orientation changed the landscape

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,380
or prophet we will render 150 or the

00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,080
quantity and so the problem here is that

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,690
actually the event is also sent to the

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,280
name is bread because the the size is

00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:24,740
another dimension of the screen changed

00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,320
so they may decide will do when I have

00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,030
anything work to me after realizing I'm

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,890
also

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:36,160
the UI so then of course the render in

00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:38,290
JavaScript you also send some UI updates

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,040
to the main different and anyway I'm run

00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:44,740
again and were in there so what happens

00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,440
here might be something we would like to

00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,820
avoid let's see I prefer an example

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,440
where added like an extra computation

00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:55,270
that would that would make it easier to

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,850
notice and whenever we click it actually

00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,740
flips first and relax and then there's a

00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,330
delay between we actually see whatever

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:06,220
we want so this is an undesirable

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:07,990
behavior right so the fix is actually

00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,669
pretty easy but the power here is

00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,120
actually move the control over whoever

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:15,100
is controlling with a condition we're

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,690
coming to move the control from being

00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,610
distributed between the javascript

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:20,890
native to move it will be only in

00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,180
JavaScript so whatever we launch the

00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,800
application we can just tell the

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,020
application to walk on this initial

00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,450
orientation so now when you're going to

00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:31,270
be rotating the screen video I want to

00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:33,040
really update automatically and then

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,720
whenever we get the orientation change

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,290
event so we click through lastly for

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,030
example the in a chrome clip because

00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:42,280
it's locked we will get the event and

00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:44,680
then we can walk to the landscape and

00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,419
then in the JavaScript we already have

00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,230
the information about what what is the

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:52,040
next

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,810
economy so we can we can execute all the

00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:59,150
updates in the single javascript loop

00:07:53,810 --> 00:08:02,240
and update the UI have all at once so we

00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:09,020
will use the state depending on honestly

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:11,870
will wonder together the next thing I'd

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:14,840
like to talk about our animations and

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:16,910
several a very popular library for

00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,980
making animations to being a physical

00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:23,980
animated jazz so the API looks like so

00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,480
I'm gonna talk a little bit about the

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:29,060
study works by creating an immediate

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:31,550
values that have like a numeric values

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,250
assigned to them to create value like

00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:37,250
this and then instead of using the

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,840
classic views or text or images use a

00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,120
animated wrappers around those views

00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:43,669
expressed have malaria top view and this

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,320
wrapper allows you to put an essay

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:47,780
property put one of those animated

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,970
values so instead of using like a

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:52,270
constant for the opacity we can actually

00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:54,170
use their current student animated value

00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,230
and then we can start the animation

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:59,360
using using different animation curve

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,980
for example spring and we've got the

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,500
volume that we want and animate and then

00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,090
in some conflict for the body for the

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,490
animations for example the definition of

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:12,230
audience friction cases Frank had

00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:15,050
elapsed so so how does it work in terms

00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,490
of communication between the friends the

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,550
first we start the animation in our

00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,020
current it goes to the native and since

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,939
the time well because it needs to

00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:26,819
execute operation after some time

00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:28,829
that Canadian mission after some time

00:09:26,819 --> 00:09:31,799
timer higher self and it goes back to

00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:33,599
the JavaScript ran with an entire event

00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:35,429
and the JavaScript runs the animation

00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:39,239
loop and the animation loop might have

00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:42,619
made some Mui so so we have this video

00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:46,529
military module and then it ended up

00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:47,999
rendering something like this will

00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:51,209
happen again and again because there is

00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:53,549
a nice ranger and responsible assessing

00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,649
we only see the problem curious that

00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:58,769
we're really doing a lot of small

00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:04,799
operations in disaster and if more

00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:07,409
important for the task to do the

00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,149
animation would like a losing print

00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:11,579
because it won't be able to be factored

00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:14,099
with with the animals but here's another

00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:17,729
example where you can see this and I'm

00:10:14,099 --> 00:10:20,189
reaching the between the different views

00:10:17,729 --> 00:10:21,899
here the complex operation is that we

00:10:20,189 --> 00:10:23,819
actually need to render the next screen

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,749
and there is this animation between the

00:10:23,819 --> 00:10:31,139
two so for this example and extract out

00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:42,119
that actually burns the CPU just for

00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:45,959
example to pick one of these solutions

00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:47,609
Pune has the property that is comb use

00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:49,349
and use native writer and this is

00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:51,029
something I've talked about on the

00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:53,359
reactive Europe side I can recommend

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:53,359
mind

00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:39,959
since the description in the UI is the

00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,959
one responsible for getting all the

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,600
we're gonna send the event to the

00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,980
JavaScript Fred and there is like some

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,720
we can define any kind of learn to

00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,399
handle this just for some house so we

00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,790
can use like catchable elements or can

00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:03,370
respond there are many different options

00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:05,199
so that's a reasonable touch we may want

00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,699
to update some views and this will go

00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:10,509
for the UM editor and go back to the

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:12,310
regiment and render Yahoo so this is not

00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,960
actually that simple so I'm going to

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:44,140
focus a little bit more about

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:47,680
on this is like whenever you are fred is

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,450
finished with handling all the important

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,160
information it would immediately start

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:52,690
composing the frame because it doesn't

00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:56,950
really know how long does it would it

00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:58,540
take to render the friend so it starts

00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,790
that immediately after the impetus in

00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,740
general so good maybe even if the

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,380
procedure in the JavaScript is very

00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:13,810
fertile it will never be able to return

00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:17,050
before the end of the frame it will

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,910
execute in the next frame scenario and

00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:20,620
also composing different but there is

00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,930
always this one frame delayed point

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,790
between in related between the handling

00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:27,340
detach

00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:30,190
on the screen so this isn't in fact very

00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:33,210
hard to notice in many places there are

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:39,660
some cases that that makes it easier to

00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:42,160
do not as one of those cases as a

00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,990
navigation Mart that collapses when when

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,260
we are scrolling but then we have scroll

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:50,020
events every wanna convert into like the

00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,360
position or the capacity of the of the

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,690
navigation bar that it's something stuck

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,450
up here just to make it look worse and

00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,940
this is what you might be able to see so

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:03,460
there is like this divide between

00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:06,640
between the action that the navigator

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:21,430
and the navigation mark is taking

00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:23,050
whatever smooth navigation mark is so so

00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:26,410
one of the ways of dealing with this

00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:30,400
problem is by using animated again so

00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:31,360
here we can implement this by using

00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:34,930
animated event

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:36,940
ooh that's a scroll handler but this

00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,560
works in a way that animated events and

00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:41,170
all of us has to map anything that this

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,420
has been delivered as a payload of an

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,420
event whose how many rated value so here

00:14:45,720 --> 00:15:47,110
under interaction between the can be

00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:49,900
handled in Chapter seven reg native

00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:51,760
there the district handling is sort of

00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,440
split between us fed in JavaScript

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,930
France but there are some gestures that

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,180
are recognized in the white wizard like

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,019
for example scroll events and then there

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,379
are some gestures that are recognized in

00:16:00,019 --> 00:16:05,119
like like pop events is so for example

00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,429
you can use touchable or you can use

00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:12,230
canned responder which recognizes and

00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:15,339
gestures several for this to work let's

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:18,439
let's see how it looks on the Bob Turner

00:16:15,339 --> 00:16:20,779
Ravana has found a venue right Fred and

00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:22,189
then there is this probably that has a

00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:24,439
logic that house

00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:27,619
like when whenever we recognize the

00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:29,329
scroll so we send this such event as

00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:31,399
well to the JavaScript and JavaScript

00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:32,929
has its own Handler and there is for

00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,329
example touchable so we started the

00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:37,189
event on the button and then we tried to

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,819
experiment that let's let's assume that

00:16:37,189 --> 00:16:42,379
we're time to dinner but then we're

00:16:40,819 --> 00:16:44,269
moving the wrong and finally to drag

00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,970
another finger up and then at some point

00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:49,309
this crawler cogniser recognizer minute

00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,350
to recognize the gesture it would have

00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:56,019
done it actually make sense to send

00:16:51,350 --> 00:17:01,119
experiments now in the recommender can

00:16:56,019 --> 00:17:03,589
it can council the ecumenical councils

00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:07,279
phenomena that doubles assault and this

00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:09,770
problem is calling so let's see what

00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,539
happens when we just like all the put

00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:13,939
the finger down on the bottom then move

00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:17,049
a little bit but not like not vertically

00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:17,049
but personally and

00:17:43,330 --> 00:18:03,560
if you can also click on the button and

00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:05,750
fire but the thing is that this is like

00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,560
a very simple example so let's see what

00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:23,120
happens when we have a more complex

00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:25,970
consider with a spider instead of an

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,440
responder certain responder receives

00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:28,910
this event there are more movement than

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,340
some we're moving moving the finger

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,340
wrong and the issue is that we can never

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,160
really like chrome exactly personally or

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:38,630
boy very precisely for in vertical

00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,720
direction but there's always some

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:42,659
component in programming

00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:44,879
direction and thanks to them there is a

00:18:42,659 --> 00:18:47,519
chance to go in recognizing fit

00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:51,019
recognized even so what happens now is

00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:55,350
that lets say given me make the scroll

00:18:51,019 --> 00:18:58,169
recognized it recognized so we start

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:01,860
canceling the recognizer but the thing

00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:10,440
is that Jacob answer is like running in

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:11,820
a different front actually be enough for

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,820
the JavaScript to recognize the demand

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:21,330
so they can sort of

00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:23,610
recognize what they were playing in the

00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:32,490
defining this letter and also calling

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:34,080
this cow here which is also a desire for

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:36,539
the typing in solution that has been

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,629
inspired by an demon destructor from

00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:42,330
collecting from the range is common in

00:19:39,629 --> 00:19:44,580
January this year and the solution in

00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,220
here is like to try and do the same as

00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:49,379
we did with animated be like remove the

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,879
logic between about like who should be

00:19:49,379 --> 00:19:52,440
who should be responsible for

00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:53,940
recognizing the district to move it to

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,860
the UI thread so that it can be executed

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,070
without communicating with China's very

00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,070
much

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:06,100
mr. handler at the moment is second very

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:09,610
experimental state works for Android

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:13,000
only and cheers I just wanted to give

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,650
you an overview on the API so so we have

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,530
a couple of different components

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:20,740
responsible for recognizing one of them

00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:25,630
is your handler so can you have that

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:27,460
your handler to implement we can have

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,710
you in this view depending on the state

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:33,280
if it's present or not present then you

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:36,820
can display different right

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,650
so for the canvas we can can define two

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:44,400
types of events that we've received with

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:46,870
the district colors the one is the is

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,030
generated whenever the mr. Conover

00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,830
changes with state of recognition and

00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:53,080
the second one is just for the chorus

00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:55,750
even with all the companies 3 not string

00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,820
of events so in this case we are only

00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,980
interested in changing the state every

00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:01,510
we're studying the handler and then the

00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:05,140
logic would be like we will set the

00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,040
state to pass whenever the event that

00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,840
the district remeasure

00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:11,850
move who said that is called the

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,990
beginning because it means that the

00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:16,320
district has been recognized then we

00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,320
will fire

00:21:24,770 --> 00:22:18,300
you interested whenever someone stopped

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,720
moving the element so whenever you lift

00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,330
a finger

00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:24,150
then the whole state was active and the

00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:27,120
new status is whatever else so when you

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,980
stop when you stop draggin we want to

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,320
remember the offset and then we set the

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,590
translate accent translate where the

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,310
next time you start dragging it will

00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:39,080
start by just applying the translation

00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:41,300
this is one of the ways you can

00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:42,380
implement the otago component using ism

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,690
does need a PID

00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:46,580
so another good thing about this is that

00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:48,860
like the the district event handler is

00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:52,270
actually really simple so we can just

00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,270
replace it with the animated event

00:22:56,470 --> 00:23:03,710
interaction so this doesn't did the last

00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,650
thing that you used in your back door

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,530
doesn't work it with without any changes

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:14,210
in brightness apart everything else has

00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:18,290
like the same online library you can

00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:19,580
nest your calendars so if you're you you

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:21,920
want to have like a long press you want

00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,990
to have a path and also panic so you can

00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,530
you can do all of that you can also like

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:29,480
use attributes to change the default

00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:30,710
behavior of each of the recognizer the

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,720
for example for the long press you can

00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:34,100
set things like for example how long

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,230
would it take me for the district's

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,640
recognized how long have you do you need

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,270
to like keep your finger on the button

00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:43,370
for the pan gesture you can even set

00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:46,790
what does the Delta in the x-direction

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:49,250
before they that a defendant is

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:52,700
recognized starts out with good cop and

00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:57,790
again if you're interested did not go

00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:57,790
check it out and everything

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:28,030
the main takeaway from your top in your

00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:31,970
opinion talk about that at the beginning

00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:33,740
I think the main takeaway would be like

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,320
for people who are willing to work with

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,450
we may need to know like what are some

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,080
of the things some of they shouldn't be

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,010
in and hunger and also whatever they

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,750
encountered in this type of issues I

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:47,060
hope that they can like remember that

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:48,920
there was the stock non-reactive pumped

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:55,270
and maybe like without the slides that

00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:58,070
I'm going to post so so that question

00:24:55,270 --> 00:25:00,830
why is use native driver not the default

00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:02,420
behavior but they it is not a default

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:05,530
behavior mainly because it has some

00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:08,150
limitations so there are a couple of

00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:10,490
features in the animated library that

00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,740
hasn't been yet implemented so that they

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:15,800
can use the connecting we use natively

00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:19,280
so that that's one of the one of the

00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:21,800
main reasons I'd say you simplify that

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:31,660
in order to build a solid app you need

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:36,920
to know internals of Romania I mean yeah

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:40,520
I mean the framework is is still like

00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:42,770
within early stage so so whenever you

00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,390
you know I mean if you know more than

00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:48,100
you

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:49,929
do more right so it's also like like

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,330
hopefully that the coal community is

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:56,170
building up new libraries and they they

00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:57,730
kind of provides a really good solutions

00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:00,549
for many of the situations for example

00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:02,740
committin in for example the kids that I

00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:05,230
mentioned about the orientation change

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:07,179
if someone of you would like to build a

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,940
better version of this library that

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:10,990
would actually people to to the

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,790
suggestion that I might

00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:15,070
that will be great light and then it

00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:17,950
will really be necessary for everyone to

00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:20,710
know how to deal with this kind of

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:21,910
problem and also you could you could not

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:24,070
actually help with sirs

00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:26,470
the distinctive stories that I mentioned

00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,840
are like everything else that that I

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:30,910
have tried to talk about in this talk so

00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:34,559
that the engineers that are coming up

00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:37,480
and employed are gonna be better and

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,880
hopefully they're like over time it will

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,770
leave a kind of less knowledge from the

00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:46,540
frame website to work on their native

00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:49,270
products sure we have time for questions

00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:51,220
Ian it seems we lost connection for the

00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:53,950
big screen I have it on my phone so when

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,320
I better read it to you okay are these

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,299
kind of gotchas documented anywhere in a

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,020
don't talk formats as they seem to be

00:26:58,299 --> 00:27:01,020
common challenge

00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,390
unfortunately so I mean they only

00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:24,470
recommended ones like whatever my thighs

00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:26,810
are so in your slides so the next one is

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,820
I missed good documentation for real

00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:33,770
cases what's the roadmap for the

00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:36,530
complete documentation that's part of

00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:39,260
the Rena thing so it's difficult for me

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,480
to speak about the roadmap or the

00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,910
project sorry

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,620
so you to explain how to solve all our

00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:47,120
issues with Rig Veda

00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,270
we can give this presentation at least

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,190
code snippets I can't do that one so

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:54,890
it's already in live stream and you can

00:27:52,190 --> 00:27:56,870
see the talks pretty sure like next week

00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:59,200
it's gonna be slightly to individual

00:27:56,870 --> 00:28:07,670
presentations I'm also going to post my

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:23,870
Twitter next one will yes six async it

00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:26,550
weights will always easier to go on with

00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:28,680
the answer again so yeah

00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,750
whenever you I'm not going to consider

00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,540
that then you can you can actually use

00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,740
them any doesn't doesn't I mean making

00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:36,870
your way doesn't really so although

00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:38,040
sister cuz you still have I mean even

00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:41,670
though your code looks like it is

00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:43,560
distinct honestly it is not so so it

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:46,860
actually can in many cases make things

00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:49,050
more complicated or not explicit in in

00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:51,810
cases in many cases so the Facebook

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:54,030
engineer is asking what happens is a

00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:56,040
sink institution fails for some reason

00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,390
and you have to already and you have

00:28:56,040 --> 00:29:04,020
already used the new value of

00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:07,770
domestically I mean the only reason I

00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:10,080
mean are the reasons why the why the

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:12,270
amazing you're referring to the icing

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,250
storage case here some whenever you do

00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:19,560
the step then it says synchronously and

00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:26,670
asynchronously so I mean there is no

00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:33,180
good answer for this you can expect in

00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:36,990
return you handle it somehow but it

00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:40,470
depends on my favorite case having this

00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:42,930
constant boring it's not only very

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,080
important because just like next time

00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,970
used I'm standing a sufficient penalty

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:52,730
images I should be avoiding screen sets

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:57,680
like that like really very important

00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:57,680
yeah I can imagine that it might mean

00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,320
so they have time for one last question

00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:05,210
so do you have a tip Alfred lock to

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:10,430
original orientation solution

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:14,410
no I it was a quick answer thank you so

00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:14,410
