Ondřej Bartas: React is the new Lego - how we deal with a lot of components

At Blueberry, we’ve been frustrated with maintaining and getting oriented in our React components and their props. That’s why we made a tool for automatically generating a component library from a project’s components. We named it BlueKit and released it as open-source.

Developers, designers, and other project members can use the generated library to browse through components in a project, tweak their props, and see a live preview of these changes. I’ll talk about the problems that inspired us to make BlueKit and how it can help React devs with their projects.
