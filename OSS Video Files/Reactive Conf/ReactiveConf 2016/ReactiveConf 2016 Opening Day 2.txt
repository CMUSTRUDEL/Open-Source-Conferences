so uh good morning you made it to the

00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:12,400
morning session uh I think that for the

00:00:10,389 --> 00:00:14,799
morning we should call this a reactive

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,270
meetup not a conference because with the

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,939
amount of people that manage to get here

00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,619
after the after parties it's roughly the

00:00:18,939 --> 00:00:23,529
size of a typical made up that with you

00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:27,150

00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:01,700
highly hello hi so my name is lanka and

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:04,130
I'm not a coder probably the only in

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,860
this space I'm a decoder as well yeah

00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,500
are you know much more and when I was

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,240
walking around this place yesterday and

00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,890
I was looking at all the leaflets and

00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:17,300
posters and roll ups and swag again I

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,250
had to realize that I probably picked

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,350
the wrong profession it's just so

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,470
obvious with the company swans they want

00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:26,900
you and it must be an amazing feeling to

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:29,270
be so pampered and competed for and

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,050
desired but I wonder what some of you

00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,970
may want and if it by any chance getting

00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,980
solid work experience in a place where

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,760
