Martijn Walraven: Building better mobile apps with GraphQL

If you’ve used the Facebook iOS or Android app in the last four years, you’ve used a mobile app powered by GraphQL. In fact, development of GraphQL started in 2012 as part of Facebook’s effort to move from web-based to truly native mobile apps, and it is now a core part of the Facebook infrastructure. It is no surprise GraphQL was first conceived to serve the needs of mobile developers, and so comes with many benefits. We'll talk about all of them, and also why you should get a grasp of GraphQL in the near future if you haven't done so, whether you develop mobile apps using web technologies, React Native, native iOS or Android.
