	00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:09,680
and today we're going to have fantastic

00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,410
speakers flying in from countries like

00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,000
from the states from from Australia or

00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:19,250
even from Europe they're going to talk

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,940
about these topics now slovakia is

00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:23,930
pretty serious or tech innovation and

00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,240
you might not think about it you know

00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:29,120
it's it's a rather small country 5

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,520
million people but in the last couple of

00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,920
years we've been really trying to to put

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:35,930
the focus on innovation and it's not

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,170
about only about us but I'm happy that

00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:42,500
this year I can announce that we have

00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:51,010
the support of also the president of

00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:53,720
Slovakia mr. Andre kiske and

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,160
unfortunately he is not able to be with

00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,680
us right now because he's on a different

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:59,300
conference for global security and I

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,420
understand that it's a little bit more

00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:05,860
important than this long term or short

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,030
term how do you put it but he provided a

00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,369
video free card that I would love to

00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:14,329
show to you guys dear ladies and

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:17,299
gentlemen dear distinguished guests it

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:21,770
is without any doubt our world is

00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:25,219
changing internet brought new dimension

00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:29,560
into our lives and naturally it

00:01:25,219 --> 00:01:33,490
influenced the economy and world as well

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,389
it raised IT and software innovations

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:40,729
which brought up new opportunities

00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:44,599
sometimes it solved our long-term

00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:47,560
problems but it also created completely

00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:51,849
new things which redefined our

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:56,240
perception of the world such as Facebook

00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:59,630
you may not always realize it but you

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:03,049
are the builders of today's world you

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:05,450
have this special opportunity to

00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:10,610
influence your country and even the

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:15,480
world in the past the nation that had

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:19,050
the most factories was the winner today

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:21,959
it is the people with high quality

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:27,840
skills who make a country rich and

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:31,110
powerful therefore I am especially happy

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:34,560

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,750
in Slovakia we have incredibly skilled

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,360
people who are not afraid to get

00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:43,349
experience abroad and I believe that

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:49,680
they you can build this country and

00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:52,879

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,970
