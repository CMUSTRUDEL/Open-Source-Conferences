Michel Weststrate: Immer-mutable state management

Mutable or immutable based state management. That is the question. But what if we could have both? In this talk we will explore an opinionated state container that serves both worlds. A single coin with two different sides. Mutable properties, instance methods, immutable trees, structural sharing, replay-able actions, time travelling, derived values, patches.. etc. This what next-gen state management might look like.
