Javi Velasco: Styling in React

Recently I wrote a small package called react-css-themr, which allows you to separate styles from components, plus an easy API to compose and inject styles. Currently I’m migrating React Toolbox to this approach and, although I don’t know yet how this will it work, I’m sure it’s gonna change how we handle styling for vendor components, making easier to customize this and any other library.
I would like to tell you how it went in a lighning talk at Reactive 2016, dropping some thoughts about styling components in React. Star this gist if you want to give your support!
