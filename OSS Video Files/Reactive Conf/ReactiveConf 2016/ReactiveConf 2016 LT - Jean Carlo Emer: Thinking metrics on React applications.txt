Jean Carlo Emer: Thinking metrics on React applications

In regular websites, it is common to sent multiple events to track users clicks. Single Page Applications change the way you look at metrics. This talk is about a simple framework we created at Globo.com to manage a metrics layer for http://globoplay.globo.com. The talk will cover how to track user flow using Google Analytics and other services. The challenges we solve were tying metrics and components, keeping information across pages and having global data. Also some React, React Router and React Side Effects concepts like context, higher order components, history state will be covered.

Do you see yourself on the ReactiveConf stage? Do you want to become the next #ReactJS superstar? If you think you have a great idea everybody in the community should know about, join Lightning Talks, and share the spotlight with the best React experts at ReactiveConf next year!

All you need to do to become a part of them is to submit your proposal to Gist and leave the rest to the community.

The ten most-starred proposals will join our line-up, and the top three ones will get a free ReactiveConf ticket with an invitation to an exclusive dinner with our speakers and VIP guests.

Have you heard about ReactiveConf? According to tech superstars such as David Nolen, Richard Feldman, or Brent Vatne, itâ€™s the best conference on web and mobile app development! It focuses on all things React and beyond and takes place annually in Bratislava, Slovakia.

In 2016, more than 700 attendees from all over the world spent three days in Bratislava getting inspired, sharing amazing new ideas, and meeting more than 30 awesome speakers from companies such as Google, Cognitect, NoRedInk, RethinkDB, Airbnb, Microsoft, Facebook, and the list could go on forever.

	00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:10,500
so you're going to talk about it how to

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,350
think in matrix on reality applications

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,740
so I work in a product that this name is

00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:19,680
globally it's a platform for showing

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,460
videos and this is what it looks and

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,540
there's a lot of videos on television of

00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:30,780
Brazil and the product is using react

00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,710
router to 2.0 be your server render and

00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:38,309
we have some clients I services that you

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:40,859
consume in the client so when you are

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:43,289
ready to launch the product we realize

00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:48,329
that you're not thinking about metrics

00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:50,789
so this right this question came is how

00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,159
we are going to track or traffic on

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,699
Google Analytics how we can do that in a

00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:58,499
reactor plication so the more easily

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,440
solution that came out it's the Creator

00:00:58,499 --> 00:01:03,769
component to to that so we created this

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,280
page view component that received

00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:10,770
location provided by react router and

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,460
this is a very simple component we just

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,250
watch the component did amount and this

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:21,390
function that's trackpageview it's it

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:24,090
talks to the Google Analytics API so

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,990
through that we can measure the page

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:30,420
view of the website so after that you

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,250
realize we have some additional

00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,320
information that we want to track we

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:36,840
have Cousteau neta cristinita in the

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:41,549
client side that we want to put on the

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:45,000
on the Google Analytics so the global

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:49,380
matrix data was a user accounts info and

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,509
a persons and things like that and for

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,320
that we created a another component

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:57,570
let's we call it the document matrix and

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,740
then we can provide some informations

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:05,460
that we remain when the component is on

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,380
the on the dawn so for that we use the

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,649
react side effect it's a very good

00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,870
project and we can do with a lot of

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,560
components in the page and it changes a

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,520
global state and so using that we can

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,990
like

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,660
receive some information about the user

00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:25,440
or receive some informations about the

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:28,920
app versions and send it to the google

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,030
analytics via through the custom custom

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,430
dimensions from google analytics and

00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,380
then we realized that we want to track

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,200
the user flow the navigation that user

00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,710
completion the project because for

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,540
example we have a playlist and a

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:47,910
recommendation list of videos so you

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,030
have to to track if the user clicking

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:53,190
the video on the playlist or if of or if

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,490
the user click on the recommendation for

00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:59,490
example and so you have to do with

00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:03,330
component matrix how we can realize

00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:06,930
which component a user used to to go to

00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,700
another page to the next page and we

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,430
have a lot of small components for

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,890
example a playlist is made for a list of

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:17,940
videos and a recommendation is made for

00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:21,990
the same list of videos so we can simply

00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:23,880
add prop to the video and they say that

00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,690
this is a playlist of these

00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:29,580
recommendations but the issue is that we

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,260
have a lot of components in the middle

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,360
of that you have a lot of other

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,310
components that that you use to create

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,680
the playlist for example so we we found

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,330
something very interesting that we use

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,120
it by a lot of libraries that is the

00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:46,980
react context and through that we can

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,010
create another component that we call it

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,930
it link matrix so we can like assign

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:54,990
some informations and gather the

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:57,480
information in that component like this

00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:00,300
we just have to declare that we want to

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,720
read that information with link matrix

00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:08,040
and then we can add access through the

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,830
DS context link matrix inter so with

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,150
that we can like change the way that we

00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:14,130
think about the components and

00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:18,480
encapsulate all the components with the

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:22,109
link matrix and we know when we're where

00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:25,520
the user click in the website so we can

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:28,110
use Redux for that instead of using like

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,650
stead of user side effects or using the

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,120
components

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:36,310
the components for that so we did we

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,020
don't use redox in the project so we

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:40,930
create out this echo system to track

00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,220
this and through the components react

00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,889
side effect and the context we

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:47,350
accomplish them the our main objective

00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:49,330
that is to track the user's magic on the

00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,640
product thank you

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:52,640
