Gregory Shehet: Road from UndefinedLand

I work at Grammarly. We like React and happily use it in our applications. However, sometimes something goes wrong and bugs creep into the code. Here comes testing. It helps make us confident about the quality of our code.

Do you see yourself on the ReactiveConf stage? Do you want to become the next #ReactJS superstar? If you think you have a great idea everybody in the community should know about, join Lightning Talks, and share the spotlight with the best React experts at ReactiveConf next year!

All you need to do to become a part of them is to submit your proposal to Gist and leave the rest to the community.

The ten most-starred proposals will join our line-up, and the top three ones will get a free ReactiveConf ticket with an invitation to an exclusive dinner with our speakers and VIP guests.

Have you heard about ReactiveConf? According to tech superstars such as David Nolen, Richard Feldman, or Brent Vatne, itâ€™s the best conference on web and mobile app development! It focuses on all things React and beyond and takes place annually in Bratislava, Slovakia.

In 2016, more than 700 attendees from all over the world spent three days in Bratislava getting inspired, sharing amazing new ideas, and meeting more than 30 awesome speakers from companies such as Google, Cognitect, NoRedInk, RethinkDB, Airbnb, Microsoft, Facebook, and the list could go on forever.
