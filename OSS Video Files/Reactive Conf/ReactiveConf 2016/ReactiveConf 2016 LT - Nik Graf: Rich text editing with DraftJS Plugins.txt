Meet those driving the change! World-renowned mobile and web innovators got together for three days in one town.

ReactiveConf, October 26 - 28 2016, Bratislava, Slovakia

For inspiration, look at one of the most-starred Lightning Talks proposals for ReactiveConf 2016.

---

Earlier this year Facebook open sourced its React based rich text editing framework Draft.js. At Facebook it powers status updates, comments & notes. Others used it to build editors matching Medium’s experience.
Together with a whole team of open source contributors I built a plugin architecture on top of Draft.js. In this talk I walk you through the existing plugins and show how you can build your own feature-rich text editor for the web with only a handful lines of code.

Do you see yourself on the ReactiveConf stage? Do you want to become the next #ReactJS superstar? If you think you have a great idea everybody in the community should know about, join Lightning Talks, and share the spotlight with the best React experts at ReactiveConf next year!

All you need to do to become a part of them is to submit your proposal to Gist and leave the rest to the community.

The ten most-starred proposals will join our line-up, and the top three ones will get a free ReactiveConf ticket with an invitation to an exclusive dinner with our speakers and VIP guests.

Have you heard about ReactiveConf? According to tech superstars such as David Nolen, Richard Feldman, or Brent Vatne, it’s the best conference on web and mobile app development! It focuses on all things React and beyond and takes place annually in Bratislava, Slovakia.

In 2016, more than 700 attendees from all over the world spent three days in Bratislava getting inspired, sharing amazing new ideas, and meeting more than 30 awesome speakers from companies such as Google, Cognitect, NoRedInk, RethinkDB, Airbnb, Microsoft, Facebook, and the list could go on forever.

	00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,969
hello everybody first of all I'm the

00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,940
graph I work on this open source

00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:15,030
projects and today I gonna tell you a

00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,950
brief story so once upon a time rich

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:20,460
text editing on the web was hard and

00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,500
fought or fortunately nowadays it's not

00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,769
because earlier this year Facebook

00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,830
released 12 chairs and draft chess is a

00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,289
rich text editor it's built and react

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,579
and it's built by and used within

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:38,190
Facebook so every time you see something

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,260
some text editing field that is more

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,530
advanced than just having text so at

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,630
mentions or hash tags or stickers that's

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,580
using graph chairs and you can figure

00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:51,330
this out by looking at the source and

00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:55,470
see that yes this data offset attribute

00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:58,230
and the cool part about draft chess is

00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,110
compared to all other which are a lot of

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,420
other rich text editing solutions is

00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:05,580
that matches the state with the

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:07,290
representation so every time you change

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,050
something in the state you actually

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,700
update the dome as well and whenever you

00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,940
change something in the representation

00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,230
in the Dom it updates the state all

00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:21,840
right second of all you can convert the

00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:23,340
whole state to a Jason and then you can

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,260
also restore the whole state from

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,780
adjacent you can take this Jason and

00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,040
save it on your database and that's

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,409
pretty cool because you don't have to

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,090
save all the HTML tags and stuff like

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,030
that you can actually get the data

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:37,710
structure in do something with it and he

00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,690
normalize it or normalize it whatever

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:42,570
you want to do in the back end and this

00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:45,900
is really really powerful know how to

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:48,630
use draft chairs arm simply you import

00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,250
your editor and editor state to

00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,140
initialize the editor state which is

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,080
basically a value and then you use it

00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,540
like a controlled component um so you

00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,520
get the editor state which is simply

00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,440
like the value in a control component

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,990
and you have unchanged then you can

00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:07,860
update editor state again alright this

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,430
unfortunately doesn't give as much

00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:14,020
because what facebook open source is

00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:18,130
simply the bare bones

00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:20,440
and um that's pretty cool because now we

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,930
have a tool to use but we don't have all

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,690
the cool features that Facebook built so

00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,580
what happened is that a couple people

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:30,010
when it's at release started to build a

00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:32,620
lot of like try to match the medium

00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:36,820
editor for example or build a rich text

00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,140
editors and that ended up pretty I would

00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:42,670
say a little bit sad because you had

00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,200
like two thousand line files codes and

00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,510
then you edit a component itself you

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,870
look like this and that's not the happy

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:51,490
place at least not for me and so a

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,650
couple of friends of mine and I we

00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,470
started out to build a plug-in

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,660
architecture on top of draft chess and

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,890
we named it rough chest plugins not very

00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:04,960
creative but it's soft its purpose and

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,670
so what we did is we built this plug-in

00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,650
architecture and we built plug-ins for

00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:12,220
example like the hashtag plugin and we

00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,620
reuse the same mechanism to find

00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,270
hashtags as tweeted us because hashtags

00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,490
is not only finding in hash and then

00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,200
whatever comes afterwards yeah you have

00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:22,570
to think about all sorts of Unicode edge

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,990
cases and so you could get this out of

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:28,180
the box with a couple lines of code you

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:30,100
get just create your hashtag plug-in put

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,110
it into the editor and you get the full

00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,900
feature out of the box and I think

00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,280
that's pretty cool um there's a lot of

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,200
other stuff like for example in men

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,209
mention plugin which is definitely the

00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:42,730
most popular one and there's even people

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:45,310
who elect we do crazy things like just

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,080
add draft chairs structures plugins

00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,640
immutable chairs and react in the

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,350
angular code base just to get this

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,850
plugin because it works so well um it's

00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:58,180
a little bit more code I'm not going to

00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:59,920
walk you through because there's no need

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,570
but in the end it's just a couple lines

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,900
of code and you get the full feature set

00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:08,640
out of the box

00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:14,500
yes select like emoji autocompletion

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,910
there is image resize and drag and drop

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,340
and whenever you change something

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:19,810
remember it updates your state you

00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,900
actually can use this and leverage it

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:26,050
and put it in into your database and

00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:31,240
restore the same thing again we have a

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:34,000
side toolbar you can make your content a

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:42,340
headline for example you can make cool

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:45,280
lists right um we have an inline toolbar

00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:50,380
so if you look for the medium experience

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,389
you can use this um and our cool in the

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:55,570
end is to make rich text editing like

00:04:52,389 --> 00:04:58,960
pluggable that you can like really pick

00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,040
whatever you need is to grasp and of

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,100
course all the plugins must be

00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,800
customizable and then they all lived

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,620
happily ever after unfortunately not yet

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:11,289
because releasing two point oh very soon

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,789
ah thank you very much thank you Nick

00:05:11,289 --> 00:05:14,789
