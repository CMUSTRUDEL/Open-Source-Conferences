Max Stoiber: Styled-components: Enforcing best practices

Building user interfaces on the web is hard, because the web, and thus CSS, was inherently made for documents. Because UIs fundamentally are not documents, we've seen a mindset shift towards building them as component-based system â€“ we are now in the component age. The rise of JavaScript frameworks like React, Ember and recently Angular 2, the effort of the W3C to standardize a web-native component system, pattern libraries and styleguides being considered 'the right way to build web applications' and many other things have illuminated this revolution. With that, and a few more things, in mind, Glen Maddern (CSS Modules creator) and I sat down and started thinking about styling in this new era. We took the best of CSS and the web to build a new way to style react applications. Let's talk about what we thought about and why we arrived where we did â€“ ðŸ’… styled-components.
