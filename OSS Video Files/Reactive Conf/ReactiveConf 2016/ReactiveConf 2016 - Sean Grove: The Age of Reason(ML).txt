Sean Grove: Living in an async world of React Native

Reason is a new developer experience by Facebook built and championed by the same people behind React. Based on OCaml, it offers powerful type-checking, incredible tooling, fantastic performance, and truly unbelievable reach (as in you'll be sceptical that it's possibly true).

Let's look at the range of practical capabilities of Reason - building universal apps that output browser-targeted code indistinguishable from hand-written Javascript but also compiles down to ARM64 assembly for native iOS apps, or replaces 15 *million* lines of memory and type unsafe operating-system code to create unikernel servers that boot in 50 milliseconds and weigh between 200KB-10MB, all from the same codebase - to the more philosophical, such as how Reason is the first language ever to separate syntax and semantics, and all of the resulting implications - and even the more whimsical, like Reason's relentless focus on developer simplicity and joy.

Full-stack apps in one language, from hypervisor unikernel to clients written in React (or ReactNative) - As easy as JavaScript, as delightful as Elm, as powerful as native, and with unprecedented reach - we're finally entering into an age of Reason.
