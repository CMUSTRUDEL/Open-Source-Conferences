Kristjian Ristovski: Markdown + React = ðŸ’™

[I'm going o talk about] writing a markdown editor which will output customizable React components, and also accept custom syntax for rendering custom React components.
The talk is going to explain the following things:
- Writing a markdown editor in React
- How to render the markdown syntax as React components
- How to customize the rendered React components
- How to plug-in custom syntax for rendering custom React components
The final result will look like this ðŸ‘‰ ðŸ‘» spoiler alert ðŸ‘»

hi everyone I'm kita he said my real

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,000
name i'm not using that anywhere i'm the

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,969
creator of ok Google you may have seen

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,480
it on product hunt and no I don't have

00:00:14,969 --> 00:00:20,730
any stickers if you ask for it I'm at

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
kitchen on github I'm at kitchen medium

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,630
but I'm d kids on Twitter because some

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,580
random guy from t juices town wanted to

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,930
use my name who posed like to tweet

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,200
server and then he's not using the

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,070
account you will have that problem

00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,840
anything else that you want to know

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,210
about me you can just go on my website

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,460
its key said I oh I'm gonna jump

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:40,620
straight a representation so it's marked

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,390
down plus react equals love and it's

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,059
about how you can render custom react

00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,980
components inside of markdown and why

00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,870
you may use that I if I have enough time

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,269
I'll explain it at the end so we have a

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,280
simple app that has a markdown property

00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:55,170
inside of the stage we have a text area

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,819
that's two-way binded and we have a

00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,890
preview on the right so it looks like

00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:00,719
this if i start typing here it's not

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,010
marked down actually yet but we just

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,749
have the text in the state and it's

00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,580
two-way binded how are we going to

00:01:03,749 --> 00:01:07,530
render that mark no texting or in

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,810
markdown we're using this library called

00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:11,040
mark down to react components and we're

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,619
going to add another property to the

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,939
state called preview and where when we

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:17,610
are actually setting the state we're

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,110
saying that preview equals M TRC we

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,600
passed the mark down and it gives us

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,890
back the reactor e so we can preview it

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,530
on the right so this time when I'm

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,880
writing a header it will actually be

00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:29,820
rendered as a header and i can add

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,409
bullets so it supports every markdown

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,479
feature but it actually passes through

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:35,189
react to render everything the cool

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,170
thing about this and why am i using it

00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:39,719
for for this approach is because of this

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,969
method called configure which lets us

00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:44,340
actually to customize each one of the

00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,259
components so i can say that for my h1 i

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,479
will take the children as props and i

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,280
will make it blue for my h2 i will take

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,039
the children and i will return on it

00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,570
Alex and for a I will actually just

00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:56,369
return something random as an image

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,070
which doesn't have to do anything with

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,409
our anchor tag so let's try it if i type

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,740
a normal header it will be blue if i

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,869
type h2 it will be at Alex and if i type

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,520
any kind of link here like google com or

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,580
whatever it will render a picture of

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:13,260
michael cera so it's it's completely

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,930
customizable

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,120
yeah how can we use it with props like

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,560
it's maybe you're imagining how can we

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,720
use just the components but how can we

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,400
use props this is our special custom

00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,680
component syntax and we're actually

00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,319
hijacking or like piggybacking on the

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,629
anchor tag syntax so the title will be

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,510
the name of our component and the graph

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:35,159
we will actually post like the props

00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:37,440
then we're going to parse them and then

00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,720
we are getting this kind of like object

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,989
back so we can modify Michael smooth

00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:44,760
let's say via props so let's first

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,069
render a simple custom component that

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,769
will be called reactive so how does it

00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,659
work here in the anchor method I'm going

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,090
to take the props and I'm going to check

00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:55,709
if the left side is reactive and if it

00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,780
is I'm just going to render a div with a

00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:59,970
special style and otherwise i'm just

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,400
going to return a simple link so if i

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:04,829
type a link like google com it will be

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,620
google com but if i say reactive here it

00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,209
will render a custom custom component so

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:11,970
we're just using the anchor syntax for

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,859
that so what kind of custom components

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,510
can we have we can have like in beds we

00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:17,430
can implement this order know on our own

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,500
like Facebook YouTube Twitter we can

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,150
have some complicated layouts we cannot

00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,340
do in markdown because we can use flags

00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,199
box and we can have stickers custom

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,180
bottom SATA headers pools like we can

00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,919
customize literally everything that we

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,510
have from mark down so let's create

00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:32,699
three components in this custom

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,440
components file first of all first one

00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,449
is reactive which I already explained it

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,430
just returns the dip with emoji second

00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:40,500
one is Michael Cera which takes the size

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:41,879
of the image and we take his mood so we

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,220
have few images that we want to render

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,120
and the third one takes an emoji code

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:50,069
and a size and it outputs an emoji so

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,569
how do we how do we implement this file

00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:54,419
because it's called custom components is

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,099
a different file first we implant import

00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:57,930
the library mark down to react

00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:59,609
components second we import the custom

00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,409
components which is just an object that

00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:03,060
I showed you and third we implement

00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:05,310
render custom components from this

00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:07,949
library called reacting markdown that I

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,389
just published on github and mpm and in

00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,739
the configuration actually we're going

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:12,690
to take the props and we're going to

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:14,579
render custom components we're going to

00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:17,609
pass the props and our custom components

00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:19,289
and it will try to find a micro

00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:20,880
component as a key in our custom

00:04:19,289 --> 00:04:22,860
components object if it doesn't it will

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,050
just render a link so let's see how

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,830
everything works we can write like

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,400
regular

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:35,340
down thank you for listening and we can

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:37,710
say also Michael Moore equals angry

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,379
Henry post him angry or maybe making

00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:45,900
happy cuz you like the presentation so

00:04:40,379 --> 00:04:48,180
so Michael is happy and thank you we can

00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:51,719
post like an emoji here we say that the

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,610
code equals pray and the size is 50 so

00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:56,550
we put this emoji and at the end we say

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:58,139
reactive that it rocks thank you very

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:02,790
much for listening you can find the

00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:04,929
library right here yay nice awesome

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:04,929
