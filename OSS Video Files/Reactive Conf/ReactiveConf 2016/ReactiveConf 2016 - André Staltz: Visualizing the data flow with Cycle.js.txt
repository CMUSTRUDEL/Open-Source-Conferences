André Staltz: Visualizing the data flow with Cycle.js

What if instead of building your own mental model of how data flows through your application, you could actually see the data flowing in real time? In this talk, we will explore functional and reactive streams as a building block in JavaScript applications with tools like RxJS, Cycle.js, or xstream which enable DevTools from the future.
