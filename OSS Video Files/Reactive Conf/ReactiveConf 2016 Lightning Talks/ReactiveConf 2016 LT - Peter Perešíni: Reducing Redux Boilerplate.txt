Peter Perešíni: Reducing Redux Boilerplate

Redux is a predictable state container for Javascript (and React) that is becoming more and more popular.

In this lightning talk, I will show you that while Redux is great, it contains too much boilerplate for small-to-medium sized applications.
To alleviate this problem, I will demonstrate how to keep Redux but customize it and bend it so that you can keep most of its useful properties and, at the same time, reduce the boilerplate.

Hopefully, this will show that you should not take Redux out-of-the-box, but rather think about how to customize it to fit your project.
