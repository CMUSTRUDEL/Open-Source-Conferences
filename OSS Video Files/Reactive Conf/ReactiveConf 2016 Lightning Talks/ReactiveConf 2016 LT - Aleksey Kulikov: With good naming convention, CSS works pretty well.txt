Aleksey Kulikov: With good naming convention, CSS works pretty well

Recently CSS has got a lot of negativity. But I would like to defend it and show, that with good naming convention CSS works pretty well.

My 3 developers team has just developed React.js application with 6561 lines of CSS (and just 5 !important). During one year of development we had 0 issues with CSS. No refactoring typos, no style leaks, no performance problems, possibly, it is the most stable part of our application.

hello my name is Alex I kulikov I write

00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:14,109
JavaScript I walk is Alec developer at

00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:21,220
project called butterfly where we help

00:00:14,109 --> 00:00:23,800
managers become better and recently CSS

00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:26,080
has got a lot of negativity and i would

00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,000
like to defend it and place it with the

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:33,760
same principles it actually works pretty

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,140
well and our free developers team we

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,940
have been developing application during

00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,640
one year we had a lot of iterations a

00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,289
lot of prototyping and we wrote more

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,010
than seven thousand lines of code in

00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:48,249
just two important statements and i'd

00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:52,809
like to share our experience first

00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:55,959
principle is bam it's a core for those

00:00:52,809 --> 00:01:00,429
who are not familiar with bam please

00:00:55,959 --> 00:01:03,459
check them 11 on CSS tricks and then

00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:09,430
start practice it and if you would like

00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:12,340
to go Father check suit CSS second

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,470
principle is process in CSS next we

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:18,520
don't use any specific preprocessor only

00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:21,340
this and this allows to write future CSS

00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,190
syntax and gives us nice features like

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:28,710
variables and nesting and also outer

00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,710
prefectures Prefecture allow to avoid

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,580
browser prefixes second feature a

00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:39,550
principle is a flexbox flexbox is

00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,370
awesome you really don't need a great

00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:46,840
framework and flex boxes has good

00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:49,240
browser support normalizes as you you

00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,580
have to have some foundation and we

00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:57,970
always if you have some component on all

00:01:51,580 --> 00:02:02,010
up module we start with the normalized

00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:04,960
CSS styles maybe some color variables

00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:07,990
mediocre variables and we start from

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,690
scratch and just build this component

00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:13,840
and last principle it's a bit

00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:17,170
controversial it calls no DRI and the

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,720
main point here is to avoid run

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,510
abstraction in the beginning and focus

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,760
on better components and right chords

00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:28,989
that easy to delete not easy to extend

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:34,510
and for those who wants a bit of extra

00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:37,810
please check styling and styling config

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,420
standard and the rest i'll link plugin

00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:45,250
to enforce bam rules so all your styles

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:47,440
are consistent clean and good you can

00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:51,690
