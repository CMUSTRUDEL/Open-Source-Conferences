Jonas Coch: An API search engine in Elm for Elm

Elm is a statically typed functional language that compiles to JavaScript. It’s well-known for its developer experience: the compiler provides nice error messages, the package system enforces semantic versioning for all published packages and makes sure every exposed value or type has some documentation and type annotations.

Elm-search builds on these nice properties and provides a search engine for all exposed values in the latest versions of all published packages. One can either search by name or by approximate type annotation. It’s like a basic Hoogle for Elm. In this talk I’ll show how the indexing and searching works, how Elm made it nice to develop and how the search can assist developers in their work.
