Jean Carlo Emer: Thinking metrics on React applications

In regular websites, it is common to sent multiple events to track users clicks. Single Page Applications change the way you look at metrics. This talk is about a simple framework we created at Globo.com to manage a metrics layer for http://globoplay.globo.com. The talk will cover how to track user flow using Google Analytics and other services. The challenges we solve were tying metrics and components, keeping information across pages and having global data. Also some React, React Router and React Side Effects concepts like context, higher order components, history state will be covered.
