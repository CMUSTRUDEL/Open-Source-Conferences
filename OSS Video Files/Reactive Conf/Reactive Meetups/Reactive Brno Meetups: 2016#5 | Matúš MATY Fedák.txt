About Maty:
Matúš Fedák has worked as a programmer for more than six years. Starting with mainstream languages (C++, C#, Javascript, Ruby, Dart), he found out that it was much easier to produce a robust codebase with functional languages such as Clojure, Elixir, Elm, OCaml, or Haskell. He studied at the Faculty of Mathematics, Physics, and Informatics in Bratislava and spent a semester abroad in Amsterdam, although he later decided that the university environment wasn’t a place for him.

He enjoys traveling, TV series, movies, sports, and PC games. From time to time, he teaches React and Clojure at meetups and conferences.
