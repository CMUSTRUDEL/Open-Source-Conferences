00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,009
hey guys my name is shaked Gregory I'm

00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:26,980
software engineer Project Lead grammerly

00:00:24,009 --> 00:00:30,250
I'm also contributor in to mobiles and

00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:32,110
focal also a fount of effort bemoan arts

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:37,089
and functional languages like a scale

00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:38,409
reason ml closure so I work in grammarly

00:00:37,089 --> 00:00:40,720
where we develop the great Roman chatter

00:00:38,409 --> 00:00:42,699
- our main projects are web editor and

00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,449
extension for Chrome Firefox Safari and

00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:48,909
edge and I'm here because I have a

00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:50,710
strong power of community we have the

00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:53,170
best community in the vault our Moscow

00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:57,040
builders give be less reactive and give

00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:59,439
chess so thank you guys and I have

00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:03,309
really long title and I can't remember

00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:04,629
it so how do you make friends with react

00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:07,060
and if your p-star develop your

00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:11,939
application using vocal so development

00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:16,110
of react apps is to court and and

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:23,009
developer of big rocks apps is called

00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:26,799
man so and development of and

00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:29,770
development of vigorous app is hard as

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,049
well so our urban because like in

00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:33,789
software development and they have a

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,139
problems with react and state management

00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:37,119
and they ask me

00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:39,460
Gregory which state management you will

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,960
recommend and because they don't like

00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,729
radix because it's have a big

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
boilerplate and not like good solute

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:48,030
solutions like Redux form and the

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,439
economics mix is pretty cool but

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,979
actually the result of magic with

00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:55,899
reaction in mobiles so I give them a

00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,520
chance and said that we have developed

00:01:55,899 --> 00:02:00,310
for common grammarly and since why

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,340
create react apps in every way so why

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:06,609
you should give a over chance and I

00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:09,009
have nearly 5 benefits and I will show

00:02:06,609 --> 00:02:13,060
them on sat.1 simple example I called in

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:14,590
coffee user direct chief conf and the

00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:16,870
first benefits is like the destruction

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,209
so we have created a structure which

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,540
extends of Eric's behavior subjects so

00:02:19,209 --> 00:02:23,650
we have Eric's behind our vocal and so

00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,340
you can just create it

00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,770
Adam dot create some value and we will

00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,660
create a stage and also we you can get

00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,870
the current value set the new one

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,390
the name of reactive conf updated to

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,190
choose the new one using modify get

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,770
previous value and receive a new one

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:46,340
like reducer also you can use all power

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:49,640
of Eric's observables like future map

00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,350
and switch map which you like and also

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,770
you can subscribe to your observables

00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,770
and manage the sub side effects okay

00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:00,470
this second point is reactive UI so

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:02,990
react can render observables so we can

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,700
just write it deep and observable and

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:08,000
when now observer will update the diff

00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,790
will be the same we render the same

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,150
value but actually this Waku you can do

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,160
that

00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,680
so focal provides F elements so it's

00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,920
like all react elements which can render

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,640
observables and when you observable will

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,890
update your component will update your

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,290
actually so how does it force there is

00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,300
no magic only subscription so our F

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,790
elements will subscribe to observable

00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,220
probes and we render when our observable

00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:38,120
props will receive a new value and it

00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,160
will be a different that's why reactant

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,420
a risk and became a friends and true

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,950
react and became reactive with focal and

00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:49,820
focus support to a new version of react

00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:52,400
so don't worry and scalable in our

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,980
application we don't have like a single

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,190
data structure so we don't have a lot of

00:03:54,980 --> 00:04:01,610
atoms we have one single source or two

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:04,280
one working more box and we need to have

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,820
a mechanism which provide to manage such

00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,060
a big store so for example we have a big

00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:15,350
structure with fuse name and status and

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:17,810
for example I want to update our name so

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,890
I can create events once YK mechanism we

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:25,550
should return me and uhm and when does

00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:29,120
it hm update if you update not only the

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:33,950
lens it will update the parent atom so

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:39,140
once is like a new Adam okay and it's

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:41,600
like too cool to use observables

00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:44,150
advanced actually because we can

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,849
decouple our state easily and put

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:49,089
appropriate part of our state

00:04:45,849 --> 00:04:52,449
our component because our dormant stage

00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:54,610
have a same data structure a tree so we

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:56,679
can just easily link the appropriate

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,529
part of our state and component and put

00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:02,289
appropriate props to our component from

00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:05,949
our stage therefore farm is performance

00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:08,110
so for example we have a name lens and

00:05:05,949 --> 00:05:12,069
so we have like a name component which

00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:16,449
will render our name like name lens and

00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:19,569
we want to update it and say if we like

00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:22,839
application in mobiles or in redox we

00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:26,169
will update our react components or part

00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:29,469
of our react app but in photo we will

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:31,300
update only F elements which render our

00:05:29,469 --> 00:05:36,339
observables so it have a great

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:38,979
performance and the last point is type

00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:41,860
safe and stability Foucault's have right

00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:44,289
on typescript so each have the whole

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,479
supports of type safe and autocomplete

00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:48,819
which provide type script and also we

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,749
have its high production radius so our

00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:56,259
editor is writing on focal and it's some

00:05:52,749 --> 00:05:59,529
production nearly for one year so here

00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:01,240
is all benefits like hm and you the

00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:05,800
structure which provides you to create

00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:08,709
our draft application in FRP way you can

00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:12,069
just render observables in react coach

00:06:08,709 --> 00:06:16,300
and also you can make your application

00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:17,829
really scalable with lands and to have a

00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,279
great performance type safe and

00:06:17,829 --> 00:06:24,309
stability so patrons even my urban

00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:27,990
because enjoyed and recommend stronger

00:06:24,309 --> 00:06:32,649
command you so star and share focal and

00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:34,619
thank you here is my Twitter account if

00:06:32,649 --> 00:06:40,599
you have some questions you can write

00:06:34,619 --> 00:06:42,249
each so we have some minutes to spare so

00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:43,869
that's really good so let's start with

00:06:42,249 --> 00:06:46,689
the first one what do you think about

00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:51,149
jQuery it's really cool who write from

00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:53,709
jQuery just up your hand

00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:57,839
guys you are awesome if you write on

00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,839
jQuery in 2017

00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,610
so the next one what is the performance

00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:09,070
compared to Redax store users with

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:12,250
immutable j/s it's really bad guys if

00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:14,310
you have a big data structure the radix

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:19,450
with images will have a bad performance

00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:25,660
it's like the next one have you tried

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:28,510
psycho yeah I have tricycle so so my job

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,730
is reading here have you tried psycho

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:35,200
jeaious and if so how does that compare

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:37,390
to react plus focal actually I don't

00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,970
really like psycho dress it's cool it's

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:42,820
kinda cool idea but in big application

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,120
it's not so easily to scale your app

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:49,540
with cycle actually another one you have

00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,780
a very big boiler plate how big is focal

00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,100
community compared to react / Redux

00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,610
actually I have open source - like

00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:59,800
library a photo reduction and with this

00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,320
with this library you can just switch

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,490
from redux to focal easily yeah but how

00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,990
big is the community how many

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:10,110
contributors or how many people are

00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:15,010
using it only two guys two guys company

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,590
that's good so why is something single

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,270
and hopefully the only state is created

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,320
through something small and composite as

00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:25,509
item here is the bigger if you want

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,509
[Music]

00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:38,550
it's to fill us a few I think question

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:41,130
actually that's also an answer that has

00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:43,050
been given okay and let's do the last

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,259
question what is the advantage of focal

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:48,300
over mu X or mobile state three actually

00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:50,100
the more box is a great solution I

00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,319
really like it and contribute into it

00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:55,829
but it's the result of magic in more

00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:59,430
books and mobile case century is awesome

00:08:55,829 --> 00:09:01,620
as well but actually it is too slowly

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,569
when you have a big data structure but

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,120
with focus there is no magic and its

00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,810
worst okay with big the distortion thank

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,550
you so much

00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,550
give it up for Gregory please thank you

00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,530
