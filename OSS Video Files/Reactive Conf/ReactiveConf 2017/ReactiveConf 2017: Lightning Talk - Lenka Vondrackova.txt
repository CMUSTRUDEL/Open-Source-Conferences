[Music]

00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:25,390
good afternoon everybody my name is

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,560
Lanka and I'm going to tell you a story

00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:33,480
about ordinary project once upon a time

00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:38,170
my team was asked to create a product

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:40,720
the product consists of two separate

00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:43,420
applications one is the mobile

00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,870
application that is supposed to work on

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:50,040
both platforms iOS and Android and the

00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:53,620
second one is the web application that

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,180
should be responsive and also it has

00:00:53,620 --> 00:01:00,129
additional thing which is admin mode

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,399
also the mobile application has to work

00:01:00,129 --> 00:01:06,090
offline and then there are some common

00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,530
features which both applications share

00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,380
they have to be secured with the

00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:14,080
password they have to communicate with a

00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:19,180
back-end server and they have to be able

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:24,159
to submit and gather reports about

00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:28,770
health care data so we dig bit deeper

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:31,479
and we decide that iOS and Android

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,729
application can be written in react

00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:38,290
native because it supports it out of the

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:41,710
box and because facebook says learn once

00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:46,780
write everywhere we went for react on

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:50,890
the photo web application then we had a

00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:55,210
lot of common stuff the security the

00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:58,630
forms reports and so on all of it we

00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:02,439
have been able to done in Redux for

00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,600
offline functionality it's somewhat

00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,610
related only of the part of the

00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,690
communication between the app and the

00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:14,920
server and for the admin mode as

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:18,700
basically the security thing if we look

00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:21,970
inside the read acts we were able to

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:25,380
reuse all the API calls we were using

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:29,590
observables for those all the data

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:31,959
transformations and so on

00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:33,849
you strum de to help us a little bit

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,819
with that I don't know if you are

00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:41,739
familiar with lambda who doesn't know

00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:45,280
that okay it's a cool library for for

00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:48,069
function programming you have all the

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,950
things like currying and so on and it

00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:53,379
has similar things as slow - but it's

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,739
better because it has the function of

00:02:53,379 --> 00:03:00,129
parameters in the correct order

00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:04,450
also we reuse all the states the

00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:06,549
authentication allocation logic but

00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:08,590
there were also some parts which we had

00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:12,459
to implement per platform basically all

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:16,569
the UI's the persistence on mobile which

00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:21,299
we use Redux persist and also we had to

00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:25,000
integrate libraries for authentication

00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:27,310
but then we were happy that we can reuse

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,819
a lot of code because it means for us

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,410
let's work with testing and so on and

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:35,019
then the question came how are we going

00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:37,209
to do that in the build time it's not an

00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:41,950
issue but when you work with that on

00:03:37,209 --> 00:03:45,819
everyday basis you would like to keep

00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:47,109
all those things lab like hot reloads to

00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:51,579
be able to change something and

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:54,430
propagate it how we can do that so the

00:03:51,579 --> 00:03:58,299
first idea came that we just seemed link

00:03:54,430 --> 00:04:01,150
it but believe me or not some people use

00:03:58,299 --> 00:04:04,209
Windows and symlinks on Windows doesn't

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,730
work as expected so we throw away this

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:09,430
idea we had to find something more

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:13,690
robust that will work cross cross

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:18,250
platform so how there was the idea to

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,650
put everything in one project but I

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,320
think everybody prefers spaghetti on

00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,470
their place rather than in code so this

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,889
wasn't the correct path the other thing

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:33,400
was maybe to use git submodules

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:37,030
I've been there I've done that and it's

00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,909
not feasible when I think that I was a

00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,370
junior who just really learned how the

00:04:39,909 --> 00:04:43,270
git push works and they tell me so we

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,729
are going to use

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,410
get some modules it's cool it's just

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,569
another repository which is linked to

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:52,690
the previous repository and it has its

00:04:49,569 --> 00:04:57,310
own history all right all right

00:04:52,690 --> 00:05:00,130
I definitely love this well so what can

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,669
we use how can we do that we will keep

00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,319
all those cool features and actually

00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,449
don't do any additional work how to

00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:13,840
automate it so we got an ultimate idea

00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:17,349
to use the whole power of NPM by using

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,840
local dependency we just wrap all the

00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:23,919
common stuff put it in the folder and

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,889
make it a node package then we link it

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,910
inside our package ensign in the mobile

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:33,430
application and the web application and

00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:35,860
install it it works only it has little

00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,729
flaw every time you do change in your

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:42,759
redox you have to reinstall well and I

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:45,430
guess that the unloading have the

00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,530
internet every time you would change

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:51,789
something in your redox it's not a way

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:54,849
so we wrote down tasks that is run when

00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:57,729
when you start your environment and it

00:05:54,849 --> 00:06:01,000
watches for changes and every time you

00:05:57,729 --> 00:06:04,479
make a change it copies file into node

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,370
modules and basically that's it I'm

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,620
still not sure if it's the most elegant

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:16,509
way but it works for us and it's

00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:19,030
approved so thank you for your attention

00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:24,539
I would like to send big thanks to my

00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:28,120
theme and see you around

00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:30,520
wanker thank you very much thank you

00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,880
let's have a look at questions if we're

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,500
there any here I would rather answer the

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,560
questions on the bar I think there will

00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:41,740
be more place for it spoken as a fruit

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,710
check yes what do you think of our

00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,560
learner Oh Lana

00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,180
I'm not familiar with it okay that was a

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:54,360
quick answer don't you think that Mon

00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:57,460
Aleppo would be way more simple maybe I

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,160
think it doesn't come into our mind when

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,830
we when we were in in that problem so we

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,889
decide to go this way and maybe I you

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:07,750
investigate it and we change okay why

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:10,600
not the NPM link instead of local file

00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:17,050
no needs to reinstall after each change

00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:23,169
comments well I can Oh dance for days

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:25,539
maybe Bluebell you know a hot rails on

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:27,789
Windows yeah the windows thing there was

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:29,590
quite a lot of issue with with windows

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:32,320
we had one guy who was using it and

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:34,150
everything what we try didn't work so we

00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,500
had to really go this way with with a

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:39,820
golf task well lenka thank you so much

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,419
for answering the questions and for your

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,419
presentations

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,870
