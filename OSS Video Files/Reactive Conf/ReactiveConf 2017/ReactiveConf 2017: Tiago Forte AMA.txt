00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:27,119
now what wait for the slide kind of

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:29,779
curious what great question it was

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,430
actually sort of backward I started

00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:36,360
around four years ago publishing content

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,220
courses on productivity and the the

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,680
contingent to the the percentage of

00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,059
software developers just started growing

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,010
faster and faster and faster to the

00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:45,570
point where I had to ask why are a third

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:47,610
to a half of my customer software

00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:49,770
developers and I asked them and what

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:51,960
they told me was your approach to

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,910
productivity to learning and to content

00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,580
has a really strong parallels to

00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,990
software and I really knew nothing still

00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,579
don't know very much about software

00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,510
development but I found myself sort of

00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:05,009
pulled backward into it and by exploring

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,979
it and learning more about how software

00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:10,170
is made and managed I've discovered all

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,790
these ways of describing what I've liked

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,040
new ways of describing what I've sort of

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,659
had intuition about and that's been

00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,369
hugely rewarding it's like I'm trying to

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,229
put words to something and then it

00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:21,479
exists in software as the single

00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,710
responsibility principle oh well there's

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,610
a Wikipedia article on it I can just

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:30,330
read that very nice all right

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,720
so we have quite a few questions from

00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,720
the audience

00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:41,340
yes user 27 is a very active here so I

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,330
think you'll probably be able to tell us

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,420
about the book that you mentioned

00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,520
specifically in the content afterward

00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:50,000
are you familiar with different

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,560
development methodologies agile scrum

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,750
come on this kind of thing yeah the

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,049
funny thing is I'm almost more familiar

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:59,760
with like meta like ways of organizing

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:02,340
and structuring software development

00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,619
than actual software so I can sometimes

00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,750
speak to like the the management or the

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:09,149
logistical or operations layer such as

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,950
agile or scrum or whatever it is more

00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,959
than the technical details so yeah I'm

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,939
pretty familiar do you have any thoughts

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,629
in terms of like are these totally

00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:21,360
orthogonal to the resources you've been

00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,769
doing or do they kind of fit in with

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,340
your your research

00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:27,550
I mean I'm feel like weary of wading

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,250
into the agile

00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:34,600
like maelstrom of controversy trying to

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,000
see if I have anything interesting to

00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,910
say on that I mean the most interesting

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,870
thing that strikes me about that is like

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:43,720
it's like we're already in the

00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,370
post-agile era in the software

00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:47,680
development community like all that

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:48,580
these viral blog posts are like scrum is

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,980
dead you know

00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,870
scrum is a trash to a trash dumpster

00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:56,470
fire all these things whereas the

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,150
mainstream hasn't even started catching

00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,160
on of these things so I consistently see

00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:02,230
that the software development community

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,820
is like 1 to 2 generations ahead of the

00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:07,060
mainstream like things that are being

00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:08,230
adopted now here in 10 or 20 years are

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,810
going to be adopted in the mainstream

00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:13,300
and to me that's that's a tragedy like I

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,460
want to like break out these ideas from

00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,350
around productivity and learning and and

00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:19,450
all these things from the software

00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,820
community or help people break them out

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,040
into the wider world because there's so

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,560
much benefit to doing so so I feel like

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,290
I don't know I don't have any like

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,320
particular strong opinions on agile or

00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,360
scrum just that we need to get those

00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,660
that whole world into the mainstream

00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,010
faster by mainstream like can you give

00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,390
us an example of what you mean like

00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,620
where you think this could be applied

00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:45,700
effectively an example of so you're

00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:47,110
saying that like these are already being

00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,060
applied in software development and how

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,190
the software development world where

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,720
else could it be applied and like what

00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,260
does mainstream mean in this case oh

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,610
yeah good point

00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,560
really everyone else besides software

00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,940
developers all knowledge workers you

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,650
know like knowledge workers this was a

00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,390
term I know it's a it's kind of a weird

00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:06,730
term knowledge workers it sounds so

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,489
buzzword II it was coined I think in the

00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,690
80s by some management consultant but I

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,910
think it's actually pretty accurate it's

00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:14,650
people that you know their knowledge is

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:15,760
their main asset it's their main skill

00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:16,120
it's the main thing they bring to the

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,680
table

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,330
so I'm thinking you know when I say

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,060
knowledge worker and mainstream I'm

00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:24,790
thinking lawyers I'm thinking analysts

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,520
any kind of business person researchers

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,660
students teachers I mean really everyone

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,900
who deals with information these days

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:33,970
which is practically everyone

00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:36,729
interesting so there's a lot of I think

00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,870
probably nitty gritty details that

00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:38,970
people are curious about like how this

00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:41,910
affects

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:44,670
or how the this thought process kind of

00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:46,980
applies various techniques so I know you

00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,880
familiar with the Pomodoro Technique oh

00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,940
yeah

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,370
like is this I need any thoughts on this

00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,320
yeah I mean that's actually a perfect

00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,510
example it's like how long is the

00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,700
Pomodoro Technique been around like

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,560
seriously I think maybe decades or

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,600
something there's a it was an Italian

00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,270
guy I think he introduced it you would

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,620
not believe how many people I mention

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,160
that to and it completely blows their

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:13,890
mind I mean they're like hype hype you

00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,590
know paid like I don't know Wall Street

00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:18,510
finance guys and I like telling the

00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,550
Pomodoro Technique just like oh my god I

00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,830
can't believe how this revolution has

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,450
our productivity and I'm just like wow

00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,160
there's really there's that quote like

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:28,440
the future is already here it's just not

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,480
well distributed I think it's so true

00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,280
the future is here there are people that

00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:34,590
are there's the myth of the or the

00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,060
reality of the 10x engineer or the 50 X

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,160
engineer the hundred X engineer these

00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,540
people exist it's just their knowledge

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,890
is not well distributed because our

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,600
knowledge tends to be stuck in here

00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:43,980
which is one reason every time I come

00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,320
across a smart person which there's a

00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:47,610
lot here I go you have to get your

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,550
knowledge out of your head you have to

00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:51,830
publish write speak present as much as

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,900
you possibly can

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,190
so there's kind of like you're talking

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,990
in this case there's like an ingestion

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,450
process where we need to centralize all

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,350
of these different bits of information

00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:03,060
and whatnots

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:06,630
there's also they need to kind of get it

00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,700
out after that right to to write it down

00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,350
one on is there any software in

00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:13,230
particular that you recommend or any

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,210
technique some sort of disciplinary kind

00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:17,070
of approach that you can recommend for

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,780
the ingestion portion yeah I mean

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,490
there's my own I tried not to you know

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,080
to do too much of a hard sell but I did

00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,620
teach an online course it's actually a

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,440
boot camp

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,590
it's a month-long hundred hour boot camp

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,590
on how to set up organize maintain and

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,060
actually put to use PKM systems which is

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,590
like the weird like I don't even know

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,910
how people find me or what they think

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,610
when they land on this web page and they

00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:40,910
see that but this is my main focus right

00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,020
now he's developing that technique I

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,940
mean we can get into it it has three

00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,230
pillars basically one actually it's

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:48,720
actually three techniques one for

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:51,330
capture one for organizing and one for

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,380
sharing or retrieval and they're really

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,940
just

00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,440
they're not I don't even know if they I

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,390
guess their techniques they're

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,860
essentially like routines or habits very

00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,850
similar to GTV

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,010
to getting things done that's really

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,830
been my inspiration I started four years

00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:06,240
ago teaching a class on GTD and I just

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,940
saw that like you can teach people a

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,560
method like a almost like a meta layer

00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,880
to whatever and they can use whatever

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,370
tools they want right it's completely

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,500
abstracted from the tools that can just

00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,180
I mean the the testimonials people get

00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,700
I'm sure many of you have seen after

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,770
abducting GTD is like I have more time

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:24,870
to spend with my kids my whole state of

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,610
mind is revolutionize I sleep better

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,620
it's like it is a complete

00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,300
transformation in people's productivity

00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,400
and I wanted to do something that was a

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,240
compliment so essentially I think a PKM

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,100
GTD is focused on actionable information

00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,770
right like open loops tasks projects

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,420
things you do actions and even in the

00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,820
most recent edition of getting things

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,280
done which was republished in 2015

00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,540
there's like five or six I have a blog

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,180
post on this you can find on my blog if

00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:54,120
you want but five or six times in the

00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:55,800
new edition he says non actionable

00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,570
information which he calls a reference

00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,730
information which is the counterpart is

00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,950
like one of the greatest opportunities

00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,720
for productivity today it's so important

00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,550
it's the biggest thing you have to take

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,350
on you keep saying this but then it's

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,240
not addressed within the GTD framework

00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,640
so I saw these quotes and I started to

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:13,500
think wow what if you could create a GTD

00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,110
for non actionable information for

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,360
content right and if the truth is it's

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:20,250
way harder because tasks are almost like

00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,230
they're very discrete almost like

00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:25,740
scientifically formulated you know verb

00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:27,510
like subject subject object target

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:30,180
they're almost like it's like a string

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:33,419
of code whereas content is it's like

00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,580
unstructured data completes no

00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:39,090
standardized formats nothing so you have

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,460
to create the formats the standards how

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,830
much how much of this relies on for

00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:45,330
example being very disciplined about

00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:47,010
it's kind of you you mentioned

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:51,090
annotating and adding lots of metadata

00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:54,270
and whatnot if I fall off the wagon for

00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,430
example how how useful would this system

00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,190
be it's a it's a great question and

00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:01,500
debate by far the biggest single problem

00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:04,530
with GTD or Thing Thing that causes

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,180
people to stop doing it is they don't

00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:08,100
maintain their weekly review

00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,620
right and David Allen calls it the

00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,820
master key to GTD well if you lose the

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:17,360
key then you're you're done and so the

00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,770
the method the course that I developed

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,970
it really was built from the ground up

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:23,100
and this is one of the things that

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,660
people have the hardest time wrapping

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,250
their heads around is like if you hear a

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:28,560
course you know where the tagline is

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,500
organize your digital life like your

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:34,170
entire digital life the it immediately

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,370
calls to mind like insane amounts of

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:40,410
upfront cataloging tagging capturing you

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,120
know putting into schemas putting into

00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,550
categories all these things and that

00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,690
turns people off right especially the

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,860
kinds of people that most need

00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:51,900
organizing and so I really I really um

00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:55,050
I've done a lot of studying

00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,720
manufacturing like really like actual

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,570
physical manufacturing which is one of

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,220
the still still decades after we think

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,250
oh that that time is done that time is

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,280
over it's still such a rich source of

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:10,590
insights and just in time just in time

00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,590
organization is a really interesting

00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:14,880
idea if you get organizing which needs

00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:16,950
to be done right but instead of

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,750
basically front-loading it where you're

00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,390
doing all this upfront work that's high

00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,550
friction imposes a very steep cost and

00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:25,710
in a world that's changing quickly you

00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,030
have no idea if that's gonna pay off you

00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:28,140
know it's like what if you organize all

00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,120
the stuff and it ends up being stuff you

00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,910
don't even need in the future you push

00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,800
you back load you push to the latest

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:37,290
possible moment all of that organizing

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,940
you basically like structure like put a

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:42,330
minimum amount of structure and metadata

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,340
around information such that when the

00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,470
time comes to actually use it you can

00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:49,140
very quickly almost do like a sprint to

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,510
very quickly assemble kind of like late

00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,900
binding assemble and bind together the

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:55,950
the content or the modules that you need

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,230
do you have any kind of recommendations

00:10:55,950 --> 00:11:01,620
outside of the course or like if you

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:04,140
give us a synopsis of techniques to

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,480
actually stick to this so for not losing

00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:15,960
that master key for example yeah I think

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:17,310
I think the biggest thing with that that

00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,130
really makes people fall off the wagon

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,050
is perfectionism it's really waiting

00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,029
and waiting and waiting until they have

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,980
just the right system just the right

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,810
categories just the right tool right I

00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,550
mean tool especially especially with

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,350
software developers the amount of

00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:34,230
developers I've talked to that are

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,329
somewhere in the process of manually

00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,630
coding their own perfect note-taking

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:42,089
system is it just just boggles my mind I

00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:43,139
mean it's crazy like and then I tell

00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,990
them you know you could just use like

00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:48,149
Evernote or bare these like really world

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:49,949
class programs that cost a few bucks a

00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,649
month no no cuz I need you know

00:11:49,949 --> 00:11:53,579
encryption at rest so no no no no and I

00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:53,910
just go so what are you doing in the

00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,470
meantime

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:57,630
oh I'm just not collecting anything I

00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,459
think the beginning is just collecting

00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,040
everything everything you come across

00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:03,750
start capturing it and every person that

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,060
I've had to do this is shocked that they

00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,339
actually are content producing machines

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,550
all the time their conversations their

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:13,170
notes the little snippets of text they

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,209
say they highlight in articles there's a

00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:17,310
great app called get liner if you don't

00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:18,480
know about it's on Twitter get line or

00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:20,370
the app is just called liner that

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,440
basically gives you a highlighter for

00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:24,600
the web so anytime you find you have an

00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,009
article instead of like web clipping the

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,540
whole article saving the whole thing

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:30,000
then extracting the text you just right

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,519
there click one button and highlight it

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,410
it extracts that text and you can save

00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:36,930
it to Evernote Google Drive email all

00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:38,430
these different things and then once you

00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,430
so once you have all this content

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,680
captured that triggers the next phase

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,800
which is oh well I should you know do

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,889
something with this you mentioned a

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,639
little bit about this idea of one of you

00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:55,199
bring on a new hire currently it is a

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,480
significant investment right in terms of

00:12:55,199 --> 00:12:59,459
my time and their time to do a knowledge

00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:02,069
transfer how do you I actually see that

00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:03,689
working in an ideal world what should we

00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:05,880
be doing difference and and how would

00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:07,319
that change things I mean that that

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,949
right there is like one of the great

00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:12,959
problems of and you're gonna solve it

00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:13,949
for us right now right I'm working on it

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,630
I'm working on it

00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:19,079
it's it's been amazing I've done a bunch

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:21,449
of research recently on wiki's and in

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:24,000
theory wiki's is our the solution to all

00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:26,189
this all right you have one place single

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,870
source anyone can edit you have

00:13:26,189 --> 00:13:32,250
community editing all these different

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:33,510
things and it's really not lived up to

00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,430
its promise

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,450
I mean even just yesterday I saw an

00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:39,180
article I didn't read the whole thing

00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:40,500
but even Wikipedia the one example we

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,700
have where it seemed like it seemed like

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,690
it worked as having a lot of issues

00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:48,300
having a lot of challenges I think the

00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:50,070
wiki paradigm is is it's it's dead it's

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,730
maybe fulfilled one percent of its

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:52,230
potential

00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,360
same thing with knowledge bases same

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,280
thing with expert systems a lot of our

00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,570
attempts at doing this have just shown

00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,610
us that it's a lot harder than we think

00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:03,050
it's not just if I could summarize well

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:06,150
like one reason why I think it's hard is

00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:09,780
knowledge so knowledge transfer is

00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:11,640
actually impossible like you know I have

00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:14,160
knowledge in my head right if I were to

00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,600
write it down for you or record it or

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,480
even just tell you that's just

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,700
information right what makes knowledge

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,060
knowledge is it's personal it's embodied

00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,280
it's embedded in my life context so the

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,600
only way for me to really have you get

00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,670
that knowledge is to help you

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,650
reconstruct it alright and we know this

00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:33,270
I have to give you exercises like have

00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:36,150
you tried things fail then I come back

00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:38,610
basically be a teacher a mentor or a

00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,260
guide right but then what that implies

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:42,000
is the problem of knowledge management

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:44,760
which that problem sounds so like

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,040
architectural and logistical is actually

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,390
a fundamental human problem it implies

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,790
that we have to teach people how to

00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:53,130
teach how to tell stories how to

00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,890
persuade and convince how to create

00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:58,320
experiences learning experiences right

00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:01,620
whereas most knowledge managers and

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,350
there is this this title CKO chief

00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,720
knowledge officer tend to be like really

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:08,970
bookish introverted types I want to be

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,230
like architecting websites instead of

00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,330
you know speaking in front of big groups

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,860
I think we just need to completely

00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,990
change how we think about knowledge how

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,190
its acquired how to transfer it and I

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:23,070
completely lost the track of your

00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:24,540
question but I was so interested is

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:29,130
there any kind of concrete vision about

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,710
how you might affect and effectively

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:38,700
bring on a new hire then oh yeah that

00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:40,200
was it I mean I'd say what I'm working

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,260
on is like a starting point to that is

00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,190
having it documented right I mean it

00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,190
just a vast

00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:52,000
is how we're all knowledge organizations

00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:54,610
you know that depend on the knowledge of

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,830
our people every CEO says people are our

00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:58,660
greatest asset right we know like all

00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:01,420
the well at least in the u.s. like the

00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:04,000
the the monetary value of human capital

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,740
what we know is like eight times higher

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,620
than all the physical and financial

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,420
capital combined and yet when someone

00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,190
leaves a job they just walk out the door

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,650
we just go by and they leave with this

00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,660
huge asset in their head right so I

00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,860
think I mean people have an incentive to

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,460
capture their knowledge for their own

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,320
purposes

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,840
so do you teams so do organizations

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,250
because just the cost when you really

00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,680
add it all up the cost of someone

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,180
walking out the door is so immense and I

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,550
think if we can solve these problem this

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,140
problem on those three levels it will

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,270
also help in the training process you

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,500
know like communicating really not just

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,690
like here's our mission here's our

00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,090
values but here is all the the standard

00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:42,490
operating procedures the learnings I

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,560
mean what what happens with most notes

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,660
taken at retrospectives I mean they

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,620
could put in a drawer or a digital

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:49,990
drawer and they're never seen again

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:51,850
there's no there's in my experience

00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:53,920
rarely a built-in process besides like

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,330
oh remember that one sprint like some

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,970
time last year where we messed up in

00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,470
this way it's it's it's you know like

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,530
it's crazy with here's a comment on

00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:05,829
agile how much time and effort and blog

00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:08,470
posts dedicated to like every insane

00:17:05,829 --> 00:17:10,600
little detail of generating tasks

00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,780
tracking them measuring them right and

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,430
yet hardly any put to capturing and

00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:18,100
managing what we learned from completing

00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:19,390
those tasks to me that's that's the real

00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,280
that was the whole purpose of doing the

00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,670
task was to have the learning and yet we

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,040
don't

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:27,520
I think we're afraid to there's there's

00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:28,840
a fear like it just it's so daunting and

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,580
so like I said unstructured and

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,130
ambiguous it's easier just to stick with

00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:34,960
tasks that you can do t-shirts sizes and

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,400
points and like measure all these

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,370
different ways it's just more it's more

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,930
like like feasible you mentioned wiki's

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:44,020
and kind of not living up to their

00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:46,210
potential one of the issues is that the

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:49,300
the information that it contains can

00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:51,180
quickly go stale like how does your

00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,380
system or how would you recommend

00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:55,360
organizing things in a way such that it

00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:57,640
still stays relevant I guess with as

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,220
little friction as possible yeah great

00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,259
so excuse me I think

00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,149
the problem with not only wiki's but so

00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:05,889
many types of places we capture

00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,620
knowledge is almost always it's

00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:11,019
optimized for others consumption right

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,000
even Wikipedia who is it optimized for

00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:14,649
the newcomer right if you want to

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,750
actually be on the inside be a producer

00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:18,309
you click on that little edit thing and

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,409
suddenly oh my god you're overwhelmed by

00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:22,120
all the comments and people arguing back

00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:24,759
and forth and you know markdown is

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,740
pretty easy but it's you know it's it

00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:29,399
takes a little bit of learning even the

00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,899
Google Docs it's based on that office

00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:34,210
Microsoft Office paradigm of a document

00:18:31,899 --> 00:18:36,509
and I think why I like the paradigm of

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:39,639
notes is it's like it's messy on purpose

00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:41,200
it's optimized for you now you just jot

00:18:39,639 --> 00:18:43,090
something down in a little notebook you

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,429
capture something on on an app on your

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,320
phone it's it's messy and in little

00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:49,570
pieces and fragments and on purpose and

00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:51,399
one thing that allows you to do this has

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:54,190
actually been recent if you go on my

00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:56,799
gait lab repository its forte labs I

00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:00,879
think it would be get lab /for tail labs

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:03,759
I'm developing with a partner an app

00:19:00,879 --> 00:19:04,840
called random note and what random note

00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,700
does it's really just a little tiny

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,740
script it's a it lives in your dock it's

00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,269
only for Mac we're gonna we're going to

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:12,610
have a web-based version that works on

00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:14,169
all platforms soon almost ready but for

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,389
now only for Mac and what it does is you

00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:20,230
click it and it just surfaces a random

00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:22,000
Evernote know for you and at first you

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,620
know when I first we first created it I

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,570
was like oh maybe once a day during my

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,580
like morning routine I'll click it and

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:30,909
might be reminded of some something that

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:33,909
I captured I find myself clicking that

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:35,919
thing like an addict all day long 20 30

00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:38,230
40 times it's I feel like it's actually

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:40,259
like replaced it functions on the same

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:42,669
triggers as like Facebook and Twitter

00:19:40,259 --> 00:19:44,350
because you get to click something you

00:19:42,669 --> 00:19:45,669
get something popping up you don't know

00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,710
what the thing is gonna be and you don't

00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:49,990
know if it's gonna be good or bad it's

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,909
perfect right and so I'm constantly

00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,190
reminded and if there's one thing I've

00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:56,620
been my mind has been blown by it's you

00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:00,279
know I have maybe 4,000 notes that come

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,659
from maybe 60 or 70 past projects you'd

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,639
think the chances that any given note

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:05,110
are not the chances that a given note

00:20:03,639 --> 00:20:07,389
are relevant to a current issue are

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,159
pretty low almost every single note I

00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:11,259
learned something gained something I'm

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:12,940
able to reuse right and that's the

00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:13,620
beauty of personal knowledge it's not

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,539
Google

00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,950
if you did random Google link that would

00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,370
not happen right by definition

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:22,409
everything in my PKM database is from me

00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:24,539
I chose to keep it so of course it's

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,059
more likely to be relevant but to

00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:28,770
finally get back to your question what's

00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,400
most what's what's really interesting is

00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:34,049
so I hit this thing the thing comes up

00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,370
the most common action that I take is

00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:40,260
delete the note right probably 60 mm

00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:42,059
maybe 40 40 or 50 percent of the time

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,400
because I see it I go oh I remember this

00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,539
it was useful at the time I remember why

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,059
I created it but it's no longer needed

00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:49,679
and I delete right so I'm not only

00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,840
adding because there's a there's a it's

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,580
easy to capture most people that I see

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
using Evernote they have like some notes

00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,950
so there's capturing caption capturing

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,090
but then one day they open it and

00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,220
they're just overwhelmed and they never

00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:02,220
open it again if you don't have a method

00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,140
of deleting of actually culling like

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,149
slowly filtering down and cutting down

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:08,159
the notes that's just as important and

00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:08,789
if you think about it that's exactly how

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,860
our mind works

00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:13,080
if you don't access some memory you

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,450
don't have to go oh file ok file

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,490
structure delete right you just if you

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,289
don't access it so my method test is a

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,029
little more proactive I actually have to

00:21:19,289 --> 00:21:23,520
hit delete but you could envision very

00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:25,260
soon a PKM system where you haven't

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,090
accessed this note in this many days or

00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,100
months or years it's deleted or at least

00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:33,600
archived and what you would have is a

00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:34,799
sort of like valuation of your notes

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,210
like you'd be able to see which are your

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,029
most valuable notes all the way to the

00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,830
least valuable only based on how often

00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,659
you've accessed them and this is there's

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,580
a there's a power law to notes that I

00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:48,000
found a very small number of your notes

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,590
is really makes up the huge majority of

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,090
the value and then the value very

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,460
quickly diminishes and there's a very

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:55,710
long tail of sort of less and less

00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,899
valuable notes you can imagine it'd be

00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:59,640
very useful to know what that minority

00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:01,470
of most useful notes are right it tends

00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,210
to be notes on like really amazing

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,039
experiences I've had or conferences

00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,679
notes on books that have been the most

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,760
influential notes on articles or sources

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,010
that were just like you know you read

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,690
those things once in a while just it's

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,240
like your whole mind paradigm just

00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:17,820
changes imagine if you had all of those

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,360
notes at your fingertip to review and

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,100
revisit yeah that seems like a quite a

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,130
nice thing as soon as I build it I think

00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:27,240
I'll start to start taking notes but on

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,220
that topic is

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,660
I mean is there a particular software

00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,490
that you recommend like if I want to get

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:33,570
started with this is it just Evernote so

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,900
I just start putting everything in

00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,790
Evernote so it's a great point and you

00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,960
know I do showcase Evernote pretty

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:42,990
strongly and all my stuff and I

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,340
constantly get the question you know can

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:46,230
I use something other than ever no and

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,030
the truth is like absolutely yes I have

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,610
no particular it's almost like Evernote

00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:52,710
is it's sort of it's like the worst one

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:56,100
except for all the others like it's the

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:57,390
least bad and the field actually I'm

00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,730
really excited by some of these apps

00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:02,850
like bear bears are really strong

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:04,440
up-and-coming up-and-coming startup that

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:05,940
is starting to breathe some life into

00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:09,090
the space because there hasn't been much

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,620
innovation there's no pressure and I

00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:12,150
think part of that is companies have had

00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,670
a hard time monetizing it's like

00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:16,350
precious data it's precious to us they

00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:18,030
haven't figured out how to monetize that

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,100
data maybe when they do they'll start

00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:21,600
putting more innovation into it but yeah

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,520
you can use any app you can even use

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,410
pencil and paper there's a great if you

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,360
really want to use no digital systems

00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:29,190
which I think I would understand maybe

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,650
if you wanted to like you know have

00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:33,870
something not online there's this German

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:34,260
system called like Dettol does anyone

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,890
know

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:41,010
Kjetil Costin settle constants some

00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:42,750
german word which I'm sure you can find

00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:44,429
on google where this guy developed

00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,280
exactly what I'm talking about

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:50,460
in extensive beautiful detail using only

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,679
note cards and it even has this like

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,559
internal referencing system where any

00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,300
note can reference any other one even if

00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,090
they change and even if they go out it's

00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,710
beautiful but the fundamental principles

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:03,870
are the same you know the same

00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:06,030
everywhere I was gonna say one more

00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,190
thing about that oh it's kind of like so

00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,900
the reason I use Evernote in my in my

00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:12,300
course and in my materials is it's kind

00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,340
of like if you're gonna teach a course

00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,980
on word processing you'd use Microsoft

00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:18,390
Word right you just you just would like

00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,500
you know my audience is all around the

00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:21,780
world they're using every kind of

00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:23,340
platform which ever no supports that's a

00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,990
you know a big thing is pretty much

00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,220
every platform so I just kind of think

00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:27,480
you know what's the thing that the

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:29,580
greatest number of people are gonna use

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,770
and Evernote really is they have two

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,540
hundred and thirty million users it's

00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:35,400
really besides that Google suite and

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,559
Microsoft one of the very most popular

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,179
productivity apps in the world what I'm

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,860
trying to do is just add like some of

00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:45,120
the routines and behaviors and tech

00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,520
to use it productively got it kind of

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,350
along that this the lines of you're

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,320
talking about pruning and kind of

00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:53,549
figuring out which notes are of the most

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,799
value

00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:58,170
do you see kind of machine learning or

00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:00,510
AI kind of coming in and playing a role

00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:02,790
in either adding metadata or figuring

00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:05,790
out what is important given the current

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:09,450
situation yeah there's there's a bunch

00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:10,710
of people working on this I mean it's

00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:14,429
it's definitely gonna have a huge impact

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:15,990
huge I've been pretty unimpressed I

00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,059
think with a lot of machine learning AI

00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:19,200
stuff compared to the hype that's been

00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:20,850
around it

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,010
Evernote acquired a start up a couple

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,049
years ago called context where at the

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,570
bottom of some notes I don't know why

00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:29,370
it's only on some notes but they surface

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,179
related notes so if you get to the end

00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,740
of it knowing you're like oh this was

00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,480
good you kind of want to see what else

00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,830
you have like that they haven't really

00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,830
developed it further I mean it's it's

00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:39,750
just it's very sort of obvious results

00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,730
like if the word appears in the note

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:43,230
then it will find other notes in which

00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:46,500
the word appears it's not exactly like

00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,690
rocket science trying to think of I've

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,450
seen anything really compelling in the

00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:54,990
space I don't know if I have do you feel

00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:57,600
like it could be a useful thing like if

00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,940
it can for example recognize the subject

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,500
matter and endued this crossing kinguin

00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:03,630
automatically or is this kind of

00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,179
irrelevant given like we should be doing

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:09,270
the pruning and and seeing this these

00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,470
notes ourselves anyway oh it's it's just

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:13,250
a matter of time it's just a matter of

00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,250
time and how it's gonna look

00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,460
yeah I mean hopefully like hopefully in

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:20,010
the future we won't need to do all these

00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:21,809
things manually I mean so easily the

00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:22,860
content we come across could be captured

00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:24,360
automatically it could probably be

00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,830
organized automatically it could

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,780
probably be retrieved automatically I

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,059
mean this this was the the dream of the

00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:31,380
Semantic Web you guys remember that when

00:26:30,059 --> 00:26:33,360
I was gonna be like the next big thing

00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:36,870
we could understand meaning and linked

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,030
to meanings and connotations and like

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,470
shades of meaning rather than just words

00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:43,710
I don't know whatever happened to that

00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:45,510
but I think it's five five years away oh

00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,390
yeah it is yeah five years away okay

00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:51,840
great all right I think that's probably

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,140
it for the time please think thanks

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,770
everyone

00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,830
really good to be here

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,830
you

00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,640
