[Music]

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,240
you

00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:20,439
hi my name is John Wargo I picked up a

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,860
last-minute topic to cover for you guys

00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,470
today I'm gonna talk about the state of

00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:28,029
mobile development at least kind of mine

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,910
my view of it how many here are mobile

00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:33,910
developers coming here want to be mobile

00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:36,970
developers how many play mobile

00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,410
developers on television all right well

00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,610
let's let's go through this I've got

00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:44,589
like 200 250 slides so I'm will be busy

00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,360
so this is me I'm at John Wargo and

00:00:44,589 --> 00:00:48,699
Twitter I'm a software developer her

00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:51,070
husband geek whatever I'm a principal

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:54,970
program manager Microsoft I work on the

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:57,040
team that that doesn't Visual Studio

00:00:54,970 --> 00:01:00,430
Mobile Center how many people have ever

00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,989
heard of Visual Studio mole Center it's

00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:05,080
a couple Microsoft employees and couple

00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,850
non nice anyways I'm happy to talk about

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,600
it at length elsewhere but basically

00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:12,400
it's a a as your base service for

00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,740
managing build test and deploy for

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,689
mobile apps and then I'm actually

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,700
working on adding in best capabilities

00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:21,009
to that as well I'm having explained

00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,009
then that's later I'm also responsible

00:01:21,009 --> 00:01:26,740
for the JavaScript tooling that

00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:29,560
Microsoft has so the Visual Studio code

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,090
extensions for react native in Cordova

00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:33,490
development so that's me

00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,170
and I've written a few books um just

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,240
because I wrote the first book in

00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,159
blackberry development didn't make me a

00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,130
lot of money um

00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:43,479
wrote a very popular book on on PhoneGap

00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,249
which at the time was called PhoneGap

00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,939
and it became Apache Cordova what was

00:01:45,249 --> 00:01:51,850
cool was that my got whoops

00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:54,640
that one got translated to Chinese went

00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:56,049
to Korean and then of course shamelessly

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,200
I just rewrote it for Apache Cordova

00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:01,240
three split part of it out for another

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,560
book and then every wrote it again for

00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:04,389
patch occurred over four so I have four

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,149
books in Apache Cordova it's one book

00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:09,310
redone three times so nothing amazing I

00:02:07,149 --> 00:02:11,770
also wrote a whole bunch of articles on

00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,390
all the possible ways to mobilize IBM

00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:16,100
Lotus Notes and Domino you ever heard of

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,720
it that became a

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,370
they call the articles and made a book

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,470
out of it so pretty cool and I'm also

00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:22,910
the only author in the world that's

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:27,440
written a book on mobile development and

00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:29,720
in football referee long story all right

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,570
so I want to talk about mobile where it

00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,480
is and kind of where it's going this is

00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,370
just my myopic view so kind of how I see

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,560
it I could be wrong feel free to

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,880
disagree with me okay if you want to

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,590
disagree with me on Twitter space fine

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,120
but if you want to disagree with me here

00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:46,520
that'd be better because then everybody

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,410
benefits from the conversation but this

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:56,750
is my view so a question for you first

00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:58,130
smartphone when was it 2007 thank you so

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,550
many people in America believe that the

00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:06,710
first smartphone was the iPhone No so we

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:10,280
had um this first one which was IBM 1992

00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:12,350
this is what looked like and then the

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,080
first actual commercial smartphone was

00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:18,200
this one the Ericsson okay which was 99

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:20,150
if I remember correctly and then of

00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,640
course this is the first one I had so

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,770
was a BlackBerry device all right the

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,520
ability to build apps right browse the

00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,130
web and so on

00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:29,510
interestingly though so you could you

00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,730
can run web apps here right so you use a

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:34,580
mobile browser you could do Java ME apps

00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:38,300
if you wanted to but the Dom was

00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:39,650
read-only can you imagine the world with

00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,500
a read-only Dom in the web

00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,330
anybody can you imagine that all of you

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,970
are young enough right that that the

00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:48,320
whole interactive web 2.0 and all of

00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,030
these frameworks that manipulate the

00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,950
heck out of the Dom right well on the

00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,580
blackberry for performance reasons the

00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:57,230
Dom was read I would say read blank only

00:03:55,580 --> 00:04:00,200
but read only was crazy

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,510
anyways so in the beginning mobile apps

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,670
from native apps so contacts calendar

00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:07,490
email right and then developers could

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,620
extend those apps but they generally

00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,500
didn't write because proprietary

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,390
platforms proprietary tools every

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,310
platform had a completely different SDK

00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,730
completely different language it was a

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,890
nightmare

00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,299
and so nobody did it unfortunately

00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:21,770
that's not very different from today

00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:23,750
except that everyone's doing it right

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:25,550
you still have completely different SDKs

00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:26,750
completely different languages but

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,290
there's a lot of money in it so

00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,230
therefore P

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,880
we're doing it um the web was for

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,650
browsing not for apps

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,080
so the original smartphones are back in

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,920
a day when you didn't have web apps you

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,840
had web browsers okay and then a later

00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,880
era arrogantly told you you don't need

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,370
apps to store everything in the web um

00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:48,500
how many were around in 2007 when there

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,670
was this big revolt where Apple said

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,530
just build web apps and the whole

00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:56,180
community said no we want to do native

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:58,100
apps and they said okay all right so

00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:00,950
going forward or kind of how things are

00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,780
today requirements for mobile apps are

00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,520
that um you got to have an app in the

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:06,830
App Store so if you're a business and

00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,410
you're doing either business online or

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,490
you have some sort of following you have

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,080
to have an app in the App Store if you

00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,130
don't people just immediately discount

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,120
you okay but you also have to have a

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,530
website in order to be able to

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,020
accommodate people that either don't

00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,900
haven't installed your half yet or are

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,950
not gonna install your app okay so kind

00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,620
of no matter what you're still gonna

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:33,100
have to do web mobile web most likely

00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:35,150
and some sort of native app okay and

00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:37,550
depending upon your products what your

00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,960
web presence may be is either going to

00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,550
be some sort of portal kind of

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,230
describing your product or it's gonna be

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,030
an exact duplicate of the capabilities

00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:46,490
in your mobile app it just depends on

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:50,660
what your public face is for your

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,640
product or service or whatever so I want

00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:55,850
to start talking about some different

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,560
technologies that you'll use to build

00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,050
that are available to help me build

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,440
mobile apps okay so the first one is

00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,030
something called um oh wait sorry sir um

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,350
yeah so that's the mobile apps and then

00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,520
there's this thing called PhoneGap or

00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,680
Apache Cordova which I've written a

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,750
bunch about which gives you the ability

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,400
to build web apps but run those web apps

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,580
inside a native application container

00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,400
and then when you want to access native

00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,200
capabilities use plugins to do that and

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,450
one of the things that they did and when

00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,910
they built their framework they started

00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,950
the project was they deliberately built

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,880
the project with the understanding that

00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,400
they were going to make themselves

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,870
obsolete so their goal from the very

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,680
beginning of starting the open-source

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:38,750
project was to make itself obsolete so

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,009
the idea being that you have native apps

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,449
if you want to have cross-platform apps

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:44,219
one of the easiest ways to do that is

00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,919
with the web okay

00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:48,659
Cordova gave you the ability to access

00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,939
the native API is from a web app but

00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:52,830
then ultimately the expectation was the

00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,199
web would evolve to a point where you

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,909
could have rich robust native looking

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,729
apps in the web which we have today and

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:02,009
then the standard capabilities in a

00:06:59,729 --> 00:07:06,360
mobile phone that are needed in an app

00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:09,300
so camera accelerometer compass file

00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,249
system what else it's a couple of things

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:13,139
that those capabilities would eventually

00:07:11,249 --> 00:07:14,719
find their way into the browser and then

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,240
Cordova would no longer need to exist

00:07:14,719 --> 00:07:19,740
the good news is we've gotten there so

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,539
we talked about mobile apps mobile apps

00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,059
are generally built by different teams

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,620
within the organization so there's a web

00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:29,659
team there's an Android team as an iOS

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:39,749
team it might be a Windows team um

00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:41,249
laughs um so but I'll show you what we

00:07:39,749 --> 00:07:43,199
see in the market is that there's this

00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:46,020
incredible drive towards having

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,999
cross-platform tools but at the end of

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:50,699
the day if you're doing native you have

00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:51,870
to absolutely have to do work with four

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,180
different completely different sets of

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:59,219
technologies or at least three or maybe

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:01,889
two all right so when you look at

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:03,330
development organizations the the

00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:04,830
enterprise development organization

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:07,499
looks a little different than the

00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,580
consumer development organization and

00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,809
the reason why I bring that up is

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,849
because I think most of you are in

00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:12,930
college or university and you haven't

00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,269
had a chance to experience the real

00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,639
world but from everything that I think

00:08:15,269 --> 00:08:20,759
you're seeing is that there's a small

00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:22,680
really cool hip development shops with

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,689
beanbag chairs and scooters that you can

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,370
go from room to room and there's a

00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:28,949
people doing really cool stuff with

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,629
Android development iOS development but

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:32,669
on the enterprise it's different the

00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:34,469
enterprise and by enterprise I mean big

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,750
companies building stuff for their

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,099
employees instead of small to medium

00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,719
companies building things for their

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:41,419
customers or even large companies

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,050
building stuff for their customers

00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:45,810
enterprises have different needs

00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,449
different requirements okay they care

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,790
more about cross-platform development

00:08:47,449 --> 00:08:53,550
than the independent developer because

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,120
they want to streamline their time to

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,770
market

00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,410
so they wanted more efficiently get apps

00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,750
out in the market and they also want to

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,100
build them less expensively and so the

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,170
reason I bring that up is you've got two

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,210
different ways of looking at development

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,800
you've got I've got to build something

00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,680
really cool that's got to be fast

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,839
engaging and useful and so in order to

00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,330
do that I need a designer I need native

00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,400
developers and then the other side of

00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:18,960
things which is hey I need to enable my

00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,120
workforce to more efficiently do the

00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,010
jobs well down the road and hat being

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,900
beautiful doesn't matter and the app

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:27,270
being native doesn't necessarily matter

00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,029
what matters is how quickly can I get my

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:33,089
employees to the data they need as

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:37,980
quickly as possible okay so that's kind

00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:40,380
of my view of this so on the consumer

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,140
outside there's an expectation that you

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:45,510
have a mobile-first world so an

00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:47,370
application that that appears in the

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:51,000
market is gonna appear for mobile first

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,010
on the enterprise side chances are

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,380
there's an existing desktop app or an

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:59,220
existing web app that is then being

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,930
implemented mobile second okay and then

00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,850
any new apps that come out so if you

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,680
look at the major corporations they've

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,570
made announcements that going forward

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,980
we're a mobile first company and that

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,690
means both for the public facing

00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,010
stuffing and the internal stuff so if

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,170
they build a new app it goes out of

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:16,830
mobile first and if it happens to work

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,000
on the desktop then fine right so

00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:19,110
they're willing to make the investment

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,760
to make sure it's as mobile-friendly as

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,650
possible and if you're not mobile if

00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,490
that's your laptop or Treach desk yeah

00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:27,320
it might work okay does that make sense

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:34,050
someone said yes I like that

00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:36,390
all right so ultimately except for that

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:38,640
native only kind of world that I was

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:41,880
talking about ultimately what a lot of

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,070
organizations want is cross-platform

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,490
development solutions so the ability to

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:51,690
build once run mini okay never good

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,339
trust me when I say that it never works

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm just getting a can but it's

00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:57,630
challenging um the idea is that you're

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,880
primarily running the same app on

00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:01,950
Android iOS you may be running elsewhere

00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,260
as well okay so that's kind of the way I

00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:06,480
see mobile being is that the Wan

00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,900
economies of scale you want to build a

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,580
minimize your development you don't

00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:11,050
two sets of developers you want one set

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:16,780
of developer building apps for multiple

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:19,090
platforms and so to accommodate that

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:21,130
there's there's multiple ways to build

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:22,630
these mobile apps so we've got the web

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:24,760
which by its very nature is

00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:26,260
cross-platform we've got native which

00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,720
size I've described before by its very

00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:30,250
nature is not cross-platform we've got

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,390
hybrid which is the Apache Court all

00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,400
this stuff I just talked about and I'll

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:34,330
talk about it more in a minute and then

00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,680
we have something called JavaScript

00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,650
driven native have you guys heard of

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,200
that so JavaScript driven native is

00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:42,310
things like react native I'm gonna talk

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,410
about some other solutions as well

00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:47,860
there's also something that I call

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,090
adjacent native for those of you that

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,650
the conference yesterday when you look

00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:52,600
at flutter what they're doing with the

00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:54,700
native compilation from a dart app

00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,480
that's kind of the thing where you you

00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:02,280
build an app in one technology dart for

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,170
example or JavaScript or C sharp and

00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:07,900
some technologies used to transpile or

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:10,870
compile or do something to that code to

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,060
make it run in on Android iOS Windows

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,310
whatever traditionally there's some sort

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,290
of intermediate language in some cases

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:19,180
it's actually compiled to the target OS

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,890
but you didn't write the app in the

00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,260
target language okay so that's what

00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:24,790
adjacent native is and then the last one

00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:27,520
is mobile application platforms um

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,830
Gartner coined a few terms Gartner's an

00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,050
analyst firm meet mobile enterprise

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,270
application platforms em cap mobile

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,740
consumer application platforms everyone

00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:37,840
decided that was too complicated so now

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,120
we have mad P mobile application

00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,470
development platforms and the idea there

00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:46,360
is that you've got some sort of tool

00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,950
that you use to design an app and then

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,200
it uses some sort of cross-platform

00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:51,610
technology to run into multiple devices

00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,830
now I'll talk about that in a little bit

00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:56,920
I still got like 200 slides to go so

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,390
I'll get to it all right so the first

00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,620
one is Apache Cordova and this is the

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:02,470
one I know the most because that's where

00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,210
I wrote four books on it right Apache

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:05,800
Cordova basically is open source project

00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,710
designed specifically to make itself

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,240
obsolete the basically the idea is you

00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,730
build cross-platform mobile apps using

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,740
the browser okay um

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,790
what's interesting what came out of this

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:20,960
was several mobile specific JavaScript

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:22,400
frameworks UI frameworks

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:23,630
that enables you to actually build a web

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,910
app that looks and feels like a native

00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:29,270
app running in Apache Cordova the

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,160
Cordova app has access to the the native

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:33,320
API is in it can look and feel and act

00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:36,050
like a native app so because of that is

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,980
very popular the way it works is you

00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:41,690
build your app JavaScript CSS HTML

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,550
you're running through some sort of

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,640
compilation process which packages the

00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:49,370
web content and then stores it inside a

00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:52,040
native app and it runs basically when

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,560
the app loads launches a webview the web

00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,030
content runs in the webview reason why

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,710
did this was so that you recognize that

00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:59,480
it's not actually any type of cross

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,320
compilation or anything no transpilation

00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:07,030
um the HTML CSS and JavaScript does not

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:10,010
get recompiled into Objective C or Java

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,810
Adlon it's not happening um there's an

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:14,420
architecture that says basically here's

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:15,980
my web app it's running in this webview

00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,540
and then there's this plug-in

00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,700
architecture that gives me access to

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:22,070
native capabilities the kernel routine

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,490
publishes a tee a set of core plugins

00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:27,950
that cover compass accelerometer address

00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:30,380
book things like that and then if you

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:31,850
need some extra api that the Cordova

00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:34,010
team doesn't cover you write your own

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,080
plugin exposes that API through

00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,330
JavaScript bridge and the way you go and

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,460
so it's it's a very popular way to build

00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:41,960
cross-platform mobile apps remember when

00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,130
I talked about those um mobile

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,170
application platforms that the

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:50,060
enterprise is use those are

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,890
traditionally that's the way those

00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:53,600
products typically deploy mobile app is

00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:58,100
through a Cordova app under the covers

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,870
ok so anyways um and then Cordova is

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,460
just the web piece of it and people

00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:03,440
started to really actively complain

00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:05,090
about how do I get a native look and

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,710
feel to my app and so multiple

00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:09,080
frameworks popped up one of the most

00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:13,550
popular is something called ionic ionic

00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:15,590
is a angular base framework that allows

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,180
you to build native look and feel in a

00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,070
web app using angular and some other

00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,330
technologies deploy them in a Cordova

00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,790
app and then you have an app that looks

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:25,310
and feels like native most users would

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,690
not be able to tell the difference what

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,980
kind of surprised me in the previous two

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,450
days nobody mentioned anything about

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,800
ionic they talked about angular and

00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,480
talked about a react native but this was

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,850
not a technology was ever mentioned

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,279
but it's really pretty powerful um

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,240
they're changing their approach which is

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,089
one of the things I'm I talked about the

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,250
end but it's really pretty cool what

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,680
they're doing the next piece of this is

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,730
react native who's ever to react native

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:49,160
yeah I'm assuming if you hear you've

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,959
known about that um the idea is that you

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,639
build you write a bunch of JavaScript

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:56,029
use some proprietary stuff called geo

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,769
sex which allows you to render native UI

00:15:56,029 --> 00:16:00,290
components and then you have a

00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:02,420
JavaScript app but there's actually a

00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:04,910
native app on the device so that's

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,470
JavaScript driven native and then

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:07,670
there's a variant to this that I imagine

00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,639
many of you've never heard of it's

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,410
called native script so there's another

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,199
open-source project called native script

00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:18,440
which allows you to build native mobile

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,079
applications using javascript code you

00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,500
basically um build an XML file that

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:25,750
describes the UI you want so identify

00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:29,779
the components and where they're placed

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:32,079
at runtime the JavaScript code or the

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:35,570
code within the runtime container

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,670
analyzes that XML creates the necessary

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,190
native components and then your business

00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,420
logic is all written in JavaScript so

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,170
there's a JavaScript interpreter

00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,250
basically that interacts with the UI and

00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:50,000
influence all your business logic and so

00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:53,870
on so it's kind of cool um you know the

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,430
- so react native is funded by space of

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,889
a Facebook so it's Facebook's project

00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,329
and basically because of who they are

00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,279
and what they are it's gonna get a lot

00:16:59,329 --> 00:17:03,139
of attention so going forward you'll

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,939
hear me say that most mobile app stream

00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:06,709
you react native apps going forward um

00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:08,990
these guys consider themselves Rebney

00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,270
and for the enterprise the difference is

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,189
native script you can access any native

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:14,240
API directly from JavaScript they've

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:16,880
implemented this patented technology

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,309
that allows you to just call an API

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,299
arbitrarily apples not too excited about

00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:26,240
that but it but it works um and then

00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:29,030
they thought that they were gonna keep

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,100
some longevity because of Facebook's

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,870
license agreement for react native but

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,790
about two or three weeks ago the License

00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:37,130
Agreement changed so before it was

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,600
prohibitive for enterprises to use react

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,640
terminated because of the licensing

00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,370
agreement that restrictions gone so I

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,840
only imagine the react days can take off

00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:47,630
and these guys are gonna

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:50,809
probably die horrible death you guys

00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:54,020
heard of xamarin samurai anyone who's

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:56,690
Ameren so the open source project bought

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:59,419
by Microsoft free open-source sitting

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,880
allows you to write one application in

00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:03,650
c-sharp and then execute that

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,919
application natively on both Android and

00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,150
iOS in Windows but you can already do

00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,059
c-sharp and Windows so that's not

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:12,409
important a really cool technology it

00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,850
was a commercial product and then

00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:14,960
Microsoft bought xamarin and then two

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,480
minutes literally two minutes later

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,289
open-source the whole thing so really

00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,120
pretty powerful alright and then the

00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,980
mobile application platforms um I

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,360
mention here that there's hundreds of

00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,880
them actually there's thousands of them

00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,890
um there are literally thousands of

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,809
companies that have built these really

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,279
cool designer tools allow you to design

00:18:32,809 --> 00:18:35,899
an application it looks and feels like a

00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,299
native app and then you click a button

00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:40,429
and it either spits out a native app it

00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:42,890
spits out a Cordova app spits out a web

00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:45,799
app spits out um many of these companies

00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:47,480
are migrating to react native and so

00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:49,669
ultimately you have the ability and this

00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:52,789
is primarily used by enterprises to

00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:55,909
design an app using real design tools

00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:58,039
and then deploy it on the web and other

00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:59,690
platforms as well so you're not gonna

00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:01,070
see this used in the consumer space

00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:03,169
you're not gonna see Facebook buy a

00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:05,330
license to this tool and use it for the

00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:07,700
Facebook client or coca-cola or whoever

00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:09,380
but you are gonna see enterprises using

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,620
it for their employees you're also gonna

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,940
see it being used heavily for

00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,899
lightweight consumer apps for businesses

00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:18,350
that you probably haven't heard of

00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:21,140
before makes sense all right you're

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,399
still awake that's good so when you use

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,840
these mobile application platforms

00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:25,340
you're gonna sacrifice you're gonna make

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,730
some sacrifice because you're not

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,679
writing native code ok and you're using

00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,779
a designer that abstract away the

00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,220
pixel-perfect stuff that you're used to

00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:36,080
doing for native okay so if you take

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:37,970
this approach understand that there's

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,679
some limitations and then you're

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,460
sticking yourself with a vendor so you

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,020
got vendor lock-in

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:43,460
you've got license agreements you're

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,260
gonna pay every year for as long as you

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,010
run your app and so for those reasons

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,890
not that exciting

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,140
so the main point of all this is you

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:55,000
what's happening now and so I want to

00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,380
talk from here kind of about the current

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,679
state of things in the future in the

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,270
eight minutes that I have left so the

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,710
one thing that was really not talked

00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:06,070
about this week at all was again

00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,510
surprised me is progressive web apps so

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,720
you guys familiar with progressive web

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:14,410
apps so there's some new technologies

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,720
there's some relatively new packaging of

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,090
technologies that enable you to build a

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,630
web app that kind of feels more like a

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:24,880
native app so the ability to throw a

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:27,640
home screen icon have an icon associated

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,530
with it cache content which increases

00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,330
startup time and so on this is kind of

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:32,470
changing the world at least the part of

00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,830
the world that I spend most of my time

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:38,290
in Apache Cordova is in the process of

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:42,549
migrating all of their existing plugins

00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:44,230
to web standards and then the rest of

00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:46,150
the world is waiting for Apple and what

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:47,590
I mean by that is I mentioned early on

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,710
that the Cordova team or the PhoneGap

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,679
team is trying to make itself obsolete

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:56,799
well we're at a point where the browser

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,169
now supports most of the capabilities

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,910
that in the core Cordova plugins so as

00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,220
we migrate those plugins to web

00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:07,059
technologies the need for Apache Cordova

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:09,040
completely disappears except apple

00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:13,690
doesn't support progressive web apps yet

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:15,790
in Safari so because of that what

00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:19,390
happens is when you've got an app you

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,340
decide you know is is the platform I

00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:23,200
want a target supported then yes I just

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,270
deploy the progressive web app if it

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,770
isn't then I deployed in Cordova app

00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,870
could all the African go in the web

00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:32,320
store the App Store and I can operate

00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:33,880
right and then again once Apple embraces

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,480
this technology which they said they're

00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:39,490
going to do they haven't said when but

00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,220
apparently they're gonna do it and then

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:43,120
once they do that then I believe

00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,610
progressive web apps are gonna be the

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,450
way cross-platform mobile development is

00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:52,000
done and he's part of it going forward

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:55,390
so let's talk about the future gonna

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,340
start with a disclaimer um these are my

00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,650
opinions I could be wrong I'm probably

00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:01,299
wrong but regardless of what I say this

00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,510
may or may not be what my employer wants

00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:10,240
me

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:13,300
say I didn't ask they're all asleep so

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:15,190
in the future people will continue to

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,090
say silly things like NIC card ATM

00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,100
machine VIN number pin number DMZ zone

00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,740
you guys don't get that thank you for

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,360
finally laughing um and then people are

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:26,190
gonna continue to convert acronyms to

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,020
words

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:31,540
Ajax is an acronym spelled with all

00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:33,850
capital letters and by the way to my

00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:36,760
point earlier it's Jason it's just Jason

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:39,310
it's not Jason it's Jason just the name

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:40,030
Jason okay let's not make things work um

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:45,700
Jason

00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:47,860
it's just Jason I have a colleague I I

00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,970
go I yell radar at her across chat and

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,200
every once in a while cuz it's an

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:52,000
acronym radars not a word it's

00:22:50,200 --> 00:23:00,850
inaccurate you guys are what laser

00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:06,010
stands for anyone anyone like light

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:13,170
amplification by what I'm doing right

00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:16,510
now I'm stimulating you emission of

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:21,910
radiation yes thank you black right to

00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:24,490
you all right so going for that's all

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:26,140
the humor going forward native apps will

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:27,940
continue to be done natively I'm sorry

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,730
they'll continue to be hard to make okay

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:33,090
but there will always be a need for

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:37,480
those types of apps so fast performance

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:39,220
large data collection highly interactive

00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,410
apps they're still gonna be need to do

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,570
things in native there's not gonna be

00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,460
any convergence technology wise Apple

00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,050
and Google are not gonna meet have a few

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:48,850
beers and decide to adopt the same

00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,500
technologies okay

00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,270
so no matter what going forward you're

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,790
using multiple tools and multiple

00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:56,770
technologies to build native apps okay

00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,800
when someone's paying you by the hour to

00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,670
do that it's a good business

00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:03,450
but when you're suspending your own

00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:06,460
money to build mobile apps not so good

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,050
and then hybrid apps um

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,390
web apps are gonna continue to get

00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,100
native capabilities Apple will

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:13,930
eventually add support for pwn II once

00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,630
they do that hybrid apps essentially

00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,790
disappear

00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,580
except in extreme cases the extreme

00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:21,680
cases are when I want a web app and I

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,840
want that web app to use some a native

00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,510
API that's not exposed as a web standard

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,760
I'm still going to need Cordova in that

00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:30,920
JavaScript a native bridge to do that

00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,900
but if you have some funky Bluetooth

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,150
scanner that you want to use some

00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,310
external printer you want to interact

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:38,750
with some sensor in the environment it's

00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:40,340
all gonna be a really cool compelling

00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,310
way to do that and you'll be able to

00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:45,500
spin up a web app using a plug-in to do

00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:49,780
that a lot faster than you can spin up a

00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:53,020
native app to do it and then finally I

00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:56,150
was lying about 250 slides by the way

00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,130
but you knew that finally JavaScript

00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:00,860
driven native continues to bloom and so

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,690
react native basically he's gonna win we

00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,670
believe and I actually say that is weak

00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:06,560
because Microsoft did you guys see

00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:10,850
Peters presentation yesterday about

00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:13,460
Skype so Microsoft is is rebuild Skype

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,130
using react and react native we even

00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,050
created open-source tool that sits above

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:22,010
the two of those and allows you to write

00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:23,510
once and then at Build time Anthony that

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,040
gives you react to react native based

00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,470
upon the target platform how cool is

00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,360
that that I mention it's free all right

00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,970
um negative script and light will

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,080
continue to be valuable to enterprises

00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:36,260
although I think react native is gonna

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:39,830
win and then I think what's gonna happen

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,720
is design designer tools and the tooling

00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,240
used to build and compile and so on are

00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,590
gonna continue to be more robust because

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,540
of the tooling space is absolutely

00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,250
amazing today compared to what it was

00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:51,020
ten years ago compared to was five years

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:52,490
ago although I'm really nervous about

00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:55,010
something okay I started I said this

00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,080
earlier my session today um when I grew

00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:58,430
up there was no windows right we

00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,620
everything was in the command line and

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,960
windows was so cool because it got us

00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,310
out of the command line and so now in

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,470
the 2000 what's the first thing you do

00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:07,660
with developer tools back to the command

00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:10,760
line

00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:13,490
um so cross-platform just basically gets

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:16,370
easier okay again native when you need

00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:18,740
native um cross-platform when time to

00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:20,720
market and budget matters because the

00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:23,420
cross-platform tools because they

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,020
deliver native apps are going to be a

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,820
better alternative for

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,220
subset of the applications that are

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,630
built well that's it for me

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,910
my name is John Wargo I work for

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:35,630
Microsoft I have one minute for

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:35,630
questions

00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,809
[Applause]
