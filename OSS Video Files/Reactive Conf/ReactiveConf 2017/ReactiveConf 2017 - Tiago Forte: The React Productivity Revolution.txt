00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,690
hi everyone this on really good to be

00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,750
here

00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:24,550
my name is Thiago and this talk is gonna

00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,040
be really different from every other

00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:30,070
talk here because I'm not a react

00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:32,380
developer in fact I'm not a software

00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:34,870
developer at all I've never written one

00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:38,950
well maybe besides some basic HTML I've

00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:43,150
never written code what I do is I'm a

00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:45,820
Productivity anthropologist I embed

00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:48,460
myself in communities the design

00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,740
community the tech startup community and

00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,630
most recently that's what the software

00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,790
development community and I learn how

00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:58,660
you do things I study you like an

00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,210
anthropologist then I take the ways that

00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:02,920
you do things the the methods that you

00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,950
have of getting things done and I

00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,659
translate them for normal people I

00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:10,030
turned that into books blog posts and

00:01:07,659 --> 00:01:12,340
online courses teaching normal people

00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,530
how to be as productive as software

00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:21,700
developers and designers and startups I

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:25,030
want to start off ok I want to start off

00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:27,039
talking about flow also known as the

00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:34,630
experience of flow or the psychology of

00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:38,020
flow kind of kills my momentum so this

00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,850
was coined by Csikszentmihalyi who

00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,729
defined it as a mental state of

00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:44,770
operation in which a person performing

00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:46,810
an activity is fully immersed in a

00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,850
feeling of energized focus full

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:52,749
involvement and enjoyment in the process

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,280
of the activity you know what I'm

00:01:52,749 --> 00:01:56,649
talking about it's when you get so deep

00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,899
into a book that the characters on the

00:01:56,649 --> 00:02:06,189
page seem more real than the world

00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:07,539
around you or or when you're you're

00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:09,490
playing a sport that you're actually

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:11,920
good at and your thoughts and your

00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,360
actions seem to fuse into one and you

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,220
lose all self-criticism

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,830
all self-awareness as you get into the

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:22,390
flow of the sport or obviously when you

00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,459
are coding when you're deep in the

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:26,750
bowels of writing your program and all

00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,640
of the information all of the

00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:30,560
the problem is that your mental

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,530
fingertips you know exactly everything

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:37,970
you need to solve the problem and I

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,770
think the one of the issues with how we

00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,340
talk about flow is we talk about it like

00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,690
it's a mystical experience like it's a

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,970
quasi-religious like that god of flow

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,980
descends upon us when actually the

00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,920
science of flow which is called

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:54,500
transient hypofrontality in the

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,810
literature is very well understood okay

00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,290
it's just a sequence of neuro chemicals

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:03,500
norepinephrine tightens focus dopamine

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:06,890
improves pattern recognition Ananda Mead

00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:08,420
improves lateral thinking nitric oxide

00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:10,130
suppresses the stress response so that

00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:12,500
relief you feel as you really get into

00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,530
it and it's nitric oxide flooding your

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:18,470
blood stream and of course endorphins

00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,180
which is the the reward the payoff at

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:27,260
the end gives you that sense of inner

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:28,730
peace and tranquility and the thing I

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,090
want to point out about flow is that it

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:34,010
represents the in the intersection of

00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:36,890
positive experience performance and

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:39,560
learning right this is why Holy Grail is

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,330
the holy flow is the holy grail of

00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,920
productivity right you don't have to

00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,989
choose just one of these or just two you

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:51,620
get three when you're in that state of

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:54,050
flow now probably up until now no

00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,670
surprise right I don't have to tell you

00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,580
how great flow is I don't have to tell

00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:59,660
you yeah you should get into flow but

00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:02,360
now I'm gonna get a bit controversial

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:04,850
okay because I think the typical way

00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,120
that people try to create flow things

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:10,299
such as blocking avoiding interruptions

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,190
and distractions in other words people

00:04:10,299 --> 00:04:16,989
long long uninterrupted stretches of

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:19,880
focus time single tasking time boxing

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:21,290
back-to-back Sprint's and managing a lot

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,410
of work and process in your head

00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:26,030
these are outdated this is an old

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,419
paradigm that's not going to continue

00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,419
into the future

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,600
all of these ways of working which are

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:37,860
very well known

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,960
you know productivity tips and

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:42,690
approaches to productivity are all what

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,030
I call heavy lips okay a heavy lift is

00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,960
what it sounds like it's this big long

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:50,490
hard slog of work of you just getting

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,150
through this massive amount of work in

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,310
one big push okay now there are times

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,050
and places for heavy lips definitely

00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,230
alright sometimes the problem cannot be

00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:02,940
just decomposed the the the module

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,600
cannot be decomposed you have to take on

00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:08,370
the whole thing but I think if you think

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,840
that the only way to produce value the

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:12,290
only way to get into flow is a heavy

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,430
lift you're going to be in trouble

00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,880
you're gonna be in trouble because heavy

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,190
lifts are socially isolating they take

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,470
you away from people they're very hard

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,940
on your body and your mind it's one

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,890
thing to do a heavy lift everyday in

00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,000
your 20s wait until you're in your 30s

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:31,530
or 40s okay kind of at the level of the

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
group or the level of the organization

00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,640
heavy lifts or this idea that the

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,220
developer is supposed to be heads down

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,400
in their little box just laboring on the

00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:44,180
problem it actually takes developers out

00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,770
of positions of influence and leadership

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:49,590
if you haven't seen the book developer

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:51,240
hegemony by Eric Dietrich I really

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:53,280
recommend it he talks about some of the

00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,630
political and social implications of

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,490
this this situation I think heavy lifts

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:02,130
actually have the effect on businesses

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,050
of taking developers away from the

00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:06,360
business side away from the human side

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,300
away from the leadership side where your

00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,690
expertise your logical way of thinking

00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,960
your practicality is so so needed more

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:20,060
than ever okay I think heavy lifts are

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,060
not the only way to get things done and

00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:25,590
it's interesting when you look at the

00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,610
the science the research on what

00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:33,120
produces flow is internal triggers clear

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:35,850
goals immediate feedback and a challenge

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,200
to skill ratio where it's hard enough to

00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,360
be challenging so you don't get bored

00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,580
but not so difficult that you give up

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,249
right so a certain challenge to skill

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,869
ratio

00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:46,969
and there's external triggers the

00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:50,329
presence of risk there has to be some

00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:53,029
risk deep embodiment and a rich

00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:55,179
environment okay there's nothing in here

00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:58,009
if you'll notice about any span of time

00:06:55,179 --> 00:06:59,359
there's no research as far as I know and

00:06:58,009 --> 00:07:01,819
if you find anything please send it to

00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:03,829
me there is no indication that you need

00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,379
a huge block of time to get in the flow

00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:08,839
there just is not I think that's a

00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:10,459
legacy of an old way of working where we

00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:12,739
had a huge block of time called an

00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,389
eight-hour workday and so we assumed an

00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:16,699
eight-hour block of time was necessary

00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:18,799
okay and here's the thing I know that

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:20,299
you've experienced this right I know

00:07:18,799 --> 00:07:22,879
you've experienced many times where you

00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:24,379
sat down and for some reason the

00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,959
environment the people you're working

00:07:24,379 --> 00:07:28,969
with the nature of the problem the tools

00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:31,339
you have you just drop straight into

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:33,499
flow right you don't need this long

00:07:31,339 --> 00:07:36,289
setup phase you don't need six hours of

00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:38,629
focus right what I'm saying is some of

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:40,099
those factors can be planned because

00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:42,829
flow is an actual neurochemical

00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:51,649
phenomenon we can plan it we can

00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:53,299
encourage it we can design for it and to

00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,789
kind of get a little more specific what

00:07:53,299 --> 00:08:00,709
I want to do so my mission basically is

00:07:55,789 --> 00:08:02,389
to do for knowledge work what has been

00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:06,649
done for software development over the

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:08,719
past few decades right so I want to make

00:08:06,649 --> 00:08:12,739
knowledge work and I don't mean just one

00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:17,709
activity all knowledge work stateful

00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:20,689
encapsulated reusable and composable

00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:22,729
okay and at this point I'm gonna ask you

00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:24,860
to sort of maybe take off your software

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:26,839
developer hat and think of yourself for

00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,809
just the next 20 minutes as a knowledge

00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:31,819
worker okay so you do coding coding is

00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:33,709
knowledge work right but there are so

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,829
many I don't care if you're the most

00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:38,329
specialized focused developer in the

00:08:36,829 --> 00:08:40,519
world there's so many activities that

00:08:38,329 --> 00:08:42,469
you do right you have conversations you

00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:45,470
have meetings you plan you brainstorm

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:48,050
you make drawings you learn you read

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,579
things you watch videos I mean the job

00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:52,370
of being a software developer is this

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:53,720
this incredible variety of different

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:56,059
types of knowledge work different ways

00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,020
of working with information so think of

00:08:56,059 --> 00:08:58,970
yourself

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:05,209
for now just as an overall knowledge

00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:07,420
worker and as I think you well know

00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:09,410
knowledge work today is like a big blob

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:11,810
just think of knowledge workers all

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,209
around the world most of them they sit

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:17,390
down and their work has no parts it has

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:19,250
no clear edges so in order to make any

00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:21,560
progress they have to load up the whole

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:23,570
blob into their head just to be able to

00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,930
do one thing right just like programming

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:29,630
used to be right programming used to be

00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,459
the effort of a genius who would load up

00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,250
the whole program into their mind and

00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:35,750
now you have a different way of working

00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,730
with software which is in parts and

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:41,839
modules and components that's what I

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:44,180
want to do for knowledge work so let's

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,160
look at these one at a time what would

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:52,580
it look like what does it even mean for

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:54,200
knowledge work to be stateful and as I

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,720
was saying I want you to think about so

00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,380
there's a misconception that your work

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,089
is made up of tasks right I'm gonna ask

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,740
you show me your work and you point to

00:10:02,089 --> 00:10:05,180
your to-do list I think that's a

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,579
misconception your to-do list is not

00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,279
your work right it refers to your work

00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,510
it points to your work all right if I

00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:13,149
destroyed your to-do list

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,800
with all your work be destroyed and no

00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:18,829
your work is actually made up of content

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:21,770
it's like producing content sure there's

00:10:18,829 --> 00:10:23,420
the codebase there's documentation but

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,220
I'm talking about way more than that

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,190
think of everything you create along the

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:30,740
way every all the intermediate working

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:33,200
process right you might have specs you

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,110
might have wireframes user stories you

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,779
might have notes on your daily stand-ups

00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:40,760
or your sprint retrospective going even

00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:44,000
further back you might have drawings our

00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,680
contextual diagrams flowcharts going

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,200
even further back the books he read the

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,390
podcasts you listen to the drawing on

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,089
the back of a napkin in a restaurant who

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:54,890
knows what it is right this is the

00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:57,110
content that you're producing in your

00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,120
work and this is what I think is the

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:01,070
real value of knowledge work right this

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,110
intermediate work that usually gets used

00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,220
and then kind of just thrown aside we

00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:07,660
don't really keep track of it it just

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,660
kind of oh that's just intermediate work

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,779
so no talk on productivity would be

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:18,949
complete without five steps right there

00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:20,779
must be five steps so the last part of

00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:25,249
my talk is gonna be you know the five

00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:26,420
weird tricks for you to make your your

00:11:25,249 --> 00:11:29,119
work not just your software development

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:33,259
work stateful encapsulated reusable and

00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:36,319
composable step one is you got to

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:38,420
collect it okay we've been for for many

00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,879
years on this decentralization trend

00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,600
alright there's an app for everything

00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,309
every little thing you want to do

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,009
there's an app but what I think that

00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:47,569
hides from us is the fact that you are

00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:49,670
even if you don't think so

00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:53,480
you're producing huge amounts of content

00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:54,949
huge and I teach a course on this where

00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,499
I lead people through this process and

00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:59,629
I'm just time and time again I'm amazed

00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:01,790
that people once they collect all of

00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:04,220
their content together like photos web

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,889
pages different snippets of text

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:09,470
handwritten notes book notes voice memos

00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:10,639
they're shocked how much is there right

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:15,139
they're completely shocked how much

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:16,040
incredible content they've produced so

00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:18,199
you've got to get it all in one place

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,699
right it's not it's no good you won't be

00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:21,740
able to make connections between things

00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:23,179
to see what relates to what if they're

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:30,019
all spread out in a million different

00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:31,309
tools what would it make what would it

00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:35,660
look like to make knowledge work

00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:38,749
encapsulated so once you've collected

00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:42,439
all this information you have to break

00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:46,100
it up into small packets with clean

00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:49,399
edges okay this is I think the big flaw

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:52,009
in current knowledge management

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:54,290
approaches and if you look at wiki's you

00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:56,149
look at knowledge bases you look at that

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,249
one Google Doc at your work we're like

00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:59,929
all of the user research is stored and

00:12:58,249 --> 00:13:02,360
just like loading up that Google Doc

00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:04,549
takes like five minutes right there's no

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,529
clean edges it's not packets it's more

00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:08,089
like streams really big streams where

00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,769
you don't know where it begins you don't

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:11,480
know where it ends it's difficult to

00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:13,429
extract one little section out and

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,679
combine it with something else it's

00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:18,110
difficult to point someone directly to

00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,879
one point in the document all right I

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,600
think we have to move to a paradigm that

00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:24,360
is much closer to packet

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,119
right just like the internet moved from

00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,999
from basically phone lines to DSL moved

00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:32,949
from streams of audio data to packets

00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:35,079
packet switching networks we need to do

00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:36,399
the same for knowledge work and that

00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,139
involves breaking it up into little

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:43,149
pieces and I'll say more about that in a

00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:44,230
second and there's a lot of different

00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:45,819
tools you could use you know you could

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,959
use cloud storage tools you can use

00:13:45,819 --> 00:13:49,269
repositories

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,249
you can use wiki's all these things but

00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:53,410
there's one category of tools that I

00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:55,420
found is really ideally suited for this

00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:57,879
which is note-taking apps I know it's

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:01,360
not very sexy it's not very cool and

00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:03,699
trendy but apps like Evernote which is

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,269
which is the one I use and recommend but

00:14:03,699 --> 00:14:08,800
also bare simple note OneNote and Google

00:14:07,269 --> 00:14:11,490
keep most people don't even know that

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,899
Google has a note-taking app right I

00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,990
think are ideally suited for this

00:14:13,899 --> 00:14:18,519
because the best paradigm for managing

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,449
our content as knowledge workers as

00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:24,519
notes right no it's not documents not

00:14:22,449 --> 00:14:27,220
files not folders notes which are

00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:29,879
personal informal quick and dirty

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:32,079
they're open-ended and never finished

00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:33,879
you have low expectations you don't have

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,529
to make them super perfect super you

00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,589
know perfectly formatted perfectly

00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:40,540
structured and they mix diverse types of

00:14:38,589 --> 00:14:42,429
media right even when notes were on

00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,679
paper you can imagine making a drawing

00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:46,899
making a sketch pasting in a photo

00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:49,449
writing something if it's digital

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:51,360
putting a video notes very naturally

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:54,549
include all different types of media

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:58,029
all of this while maintaining one

00:14:54,549 --> 00:15:03,040
discrete unit which is the note write a

00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:07,899
note what does it look like to make

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:09,490
knowledge work reusable so once you have

00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:12,459
these modules you can't go oh I have

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,799
lots of content modules that's great you

00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:17,170
have to give them clean interfaces right

00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,139
Legos only work because they're like

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:21,879
measure down to the micro millimeter and

00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:22,240
any two Legos in the world will fit

00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,209
together

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,970
right very clean interfaces for content

00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:29,499
what this looks like is metadata and

00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:31,269
these are just examples this can take

00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:33,009
many different forms these are more

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:34,780
specific to text but there's different

00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,790
metadata for images for videos

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:39,840
you know everything from informative

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:43,000
titles naming conventions thematic tags

00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:46,240
summaries comments and annotations

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,010
formatting links and images right each

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,440
one of these modules needs to be

00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,510
described in a way that you can quickly

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,070
get the gist of it so you can see

00:15:52,510 --> 00:16:00,700
whether you want to combine it with

00:15:54,070 --> 00:16:02,860
other modules of content step four is to

00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,800
organize right until we have true

00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,270
artificial intelligence it's not going

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,790
to be enough to just dump all of this

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,680
content into one big folder and say I'll

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:13,960
search for later I don't think I don't

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,910
think we're there yet and what I find

00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,230
time and time again is you don't have to

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:19,150
that word organize is like Oh

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,760
organize like is that really adding

00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:23,650
value is that really necessary what I

00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,950
find time and time and time again is

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,420
when people are starting a project and

00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,490
they want to know do I have something

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,620
existing that I could use for this they

00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,480
asked two questions they asked what have

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,060
I done like this before and they say

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,340
what do I know on this topic just two

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,200
simple questions which implies is a very

00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:44,140
simple organizational scheme you can use

00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:48,330
in organizing york your work in process

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:55,180
content which is by project and my topic

00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:57,340
and finally composable this is probably

00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,820
the thing you least thought you would

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:02,620
hear to developer conference but I think

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,210
and it's also notice and big ewis part

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,620
right I really depend the create this is

00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:07,090
essentially the creative process it

00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,530
really depends if you're a coder if

00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:13,240
you're an artist if you're a writer if

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:15,010
you're a musician but I think the way to

00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,260
get better at compose ability to make

00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:20,500
our work more composable is to practice

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,890
composing you can do a few next like

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,890
four

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,070
okay this can include seen actually

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:33,320
practicing training getting good at

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,420
switching contexts getting feedback from

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,570
your colleagues from outside

00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:42,950
collaborators from customers interviews

00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:45,230
user interviews interviews of others it

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:47,600
includes writing write tweet storms

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,070
which is my personal favorite if you

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,400
follow me on Twitter get ready for some

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:54,440
really long tweet storms I'm sorry

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,690
taking good notes writing write writing

00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,730
is this process of externalizing your

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:01,100
thoughts and it helps clarify your

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:06,440
entire creative process to get that

00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:08,750
writing published drawing write visual

00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:12,170
thinking explaining things making

00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:17,150
diagrams making abstract ideas more

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:20,690
tangible performing okay now it starts

00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:24,020
to get Performing right but I think when

00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,340
you take that step to get on a stage to

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,800
really stand in front of people and say

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,140
I know what I'm talking about your

00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:31,490
knowledge what you know your performance

00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,020
your productivity takes on a whole new

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,490
level because you're forced to stand for

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:35,810
something

00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:38,060
so it's could include I mean nothing

00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,460
that crazy speaking at an event speaking

00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:41,720
at a meet-up or recording a video don't

00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,550
even have to get in front of people

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:48,230
we have YouTube and periscope and

00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:50,870
Twitter and all these things producing

00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,820
right actually publishing releasing

00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,160
early and releasing often to the outside

00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:57,130
work to the outside world summarizing or

00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,570
condensing someone else's ideas

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,490
interpreting them or critiquing them or

00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:06,010
Trant even just translating from one

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:09,680
medium to another and finally selling

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:11,390
right when you put yourself and your

00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:13,370
work on the line to sell them and I mean

00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:16,510
selling for money but also selling your

00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:19,280
ideas teaching or selling your projects

00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,800
which is collaborating all right this

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:24,380
kind of a spectrum from from like more

00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,230
private to more public less engaged to

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,600
more engaged right this is what I think

00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,800
composability looks like in the broader

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,970
world of knowledge work and it's

00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,580
something most knowledge workers do not

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:35,980
do right yeah we have blog social media

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,030
is pushing everyone in this direction

00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,480
but what would it look like if we were

00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,809
all

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:43,880
constantly pushing out valuable work to

00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:46,280
help others learn to help others advance

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,260
to clarify our own thinking the thinking

00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:53,900
of others I think the world would look

00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:55,490
very different and I think the benefits

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,410
this would bring to knowledge work are

00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,020
some of the same benefits that you've

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:02,570
experienced over the last years in

00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:05,330
software development abstraction right

00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:07,929
imagine if kind of general knowledge

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:11,480
work had abstraction you could separate

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:14,350
content from presentation flexibility

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,790
lay binding right what if instead of

00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,980
creating everything from scratch from

00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:20,929
zero upfront knowledge workers around

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,000
the world could just create modules

00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,160
spend all of their time producing and

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,870
documenting modules and then right when

00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,210
the problem arose right at the point

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:31,309
where a solution is needed they could

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:34,540
just snap together different modules of

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:36,950
content that they've already produced

00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,150
reusability like I said instead of

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:40,490
starting from scratch instead of

00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:43,309
starting from zero you could basically

00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:44,840
bootstrap projects just like like

00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:47,600
bootstrap and other front-end frameworks

00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,280
where you have like 80% of the the basic

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,700
set up for you and you just build on top

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,260
of that a single source of truth instead

00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,480
of you know duplicate duplicate

00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,950
duplicate like having 16 versions of

00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,510
every single document and then you

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,070
upload it on box and no one knows what

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,720
the heck is going on right we're making

00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:04,880
progress on that but if there was a

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,030
single source of truth where any one say

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,640
in a team or in an organization could

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:12,890
almost like an API link to and pull a

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:16,100
piece of knowledge a piece of content on

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:18,799
demand as needed in a format using an

00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:20,210
interface that they could that they knew

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,540
was predictable that they knew they

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:25,610
could rely on simultaneous development

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,429
right we could break out these heavy

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,169
lifts into smaller pieces which would

00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:32,600
improve collaboration it would improve

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,790
remote work right if you could just send

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,860
one module out to a developer around the

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,570
world get it back and with having a

00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,130
clean interface know how that was going

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,140
to be integrated back into your work all

00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:45,799
of this happens today but it's very very

00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:48,290
messy right very messy and a focus on

00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,120
incremental changes I love the word I've

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:51,410
been reading on the virtual Dom and tree

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:53,390
reconciliation how

00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,010
you don't have to refresh every time and

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:58,430
how often is knowledge work like that

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:00,410
right a new hire joins the company you

00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,300
have to teach them everything like take

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,580
your time sit with them to educate them

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,200
from 0 to 100 right and then another

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,730
person comes online you're oh we're

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,620
always starting from nothing for some

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,820
reason and knowledge work and knowledge

00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,110
work doesn't have to be that way it

00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:17,930
could be reusable because it's just

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:22,340
information it's just knowledge and

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:25,730
leaking linking this back to flow this

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:28,100
isn't just about more productivity right

00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,770
it's not just about let's get more work

00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,450
done with even fewer people right

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:35,390
there's actually something about the

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:37,580
fundamental experience of work here ok

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:39,350
cuz if you look at the 3 internal

00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:41,950
triggers for flow the ones that we have

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,580
control over they all become much easier

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:48,170
when work is broken down into packets

00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,120
right it's much easier to make a clear

00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:52,120
goal for one little module that you're

00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,800
creating rather than a massive project

00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,900
right it's much easier to get immediate

00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,970
feedback on one little module one

00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,250
document to an analysis one presentation

00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,470
whatever it is than to wait weeks or

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,080
months for it to go to the market and

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,240
get feedback and it's much easier to

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,980
calibrate exactly how hard something

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,360
should be for one little module than a

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:17,090
massive project ok I think that software

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:19,520
developers probably experienced s2 flow

00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:22,160
more than maybe any other profession

00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,880
right because you have these things okay

00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:28,430
but flow today I think is a privilege

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,770
it's a rare privilege for hyper educated

00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:33,230
and hyper specialized knowledge workers

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:35,090
like us right imagine if that experience

00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:36,860
was more common if more people all

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:40,340
around the world lawyers accountants

00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:43,250
doctors analysts personal assistants

00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,080
everyone was able to not force

00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:47,480
themselves into a way of working that

00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:50,030
involved a heavy-lift but was able to

00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,070
structure their work to produce the

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,490
psychological effects that they're

00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:54,490
interested in

00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:59,210
so this is the the problem that I'm

00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,130
focused on right now which is called

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:02,540
which I call personal knowledge

00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,520
management you probably never heard of

00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:07,430
personal knowledge management you can

00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,020
check out the Wikipedia article but I

00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:11,060
imagine a future where we are not just

00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,830
knowledge workers you know like they're

00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:14,750
on the production line like working our

00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:15,230
knowledge okay new product working our

00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,540
knowledge

00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:19,880
we're actually knowledge managers so we

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:20,720
take a couple steps back from the

00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,850
production line

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,740
we're like the foreman up on the catwalk

00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,140
looking down on his knowledge workers

00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:29,870
and the knowledge workers would be

00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,740
systems would be technological systems

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,640
would be the different sort of like

00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,530
organizational systems that I'm talking

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,520
about here we can gain more leverage

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:43,010
more speed and more throughput from the

00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,210
tools at our disposal which as we're

00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:51,410
learning here are getting more and more

00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:55,460
advanced every year so I'm here because

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:57,740
I need a help okay I can read some

00:24:55,460 --> 00:25:01,070
articles and you know do some little

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:03,290
tutorials and listen to talks but as you

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:06,440
could probably tell I don't have the

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:08,120
real world experience to make the

00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,280
mappings between what's going on in

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,560
software and what's going on in other

00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,360
types of work so if you're interested in

00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,920
this or you'd like to learn more or you

00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,240
think there's something I missed you

00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,380
have some feedback for me I'd really

00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:23,420
really love for you to reach out to me

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:26,660
this site is not live yet but by the end

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:28,940
of the conference it will be it'll have

00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,740
these slides with my commentary right

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:33,830
once I have the recording of this talk

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:35,630
I'll post the video as well it's going

00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:38,060
to have it's almost finished a blog post

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:39,890
on sort of what would the next stage be

00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,570
like like if we had modular knowledge

00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,390
work how we would actually complete

00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:46,010
projects and I have my contact

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,110
information which is also here really

00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:51,500
encourage you to come talk to me come

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,990
find me join me during my AMA at four

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:57,410
o'clock and otherwise find me online or

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,470
on Twitter thank you

00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,470
you

00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,160
