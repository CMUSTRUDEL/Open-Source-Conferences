[Music]

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,240
you

00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:24,380
hey everyone good morning morning like

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,279
president myself my name is Lucas Lucas

00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,529
Keshet and that means box in Portuguese

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:34,820
I'm actually from Brazil but I'm living

00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:36,620
and working in Lisbon you know okay

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,699
thank you and I'm living and working

00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:43,250
Lisbon in our company called OLX it's

00:00:40,699 --> 00:00:46,250
classified company part of Naspers group

00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:49,520
and I'm working currently in a reactor

00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:54,170
app called Transpo there is a business

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,829
tool from trouser a company to that that

00:00:54,170 --> 00:01:01,510
cell have machinery so how many of you

00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:06,080
guys know a little bit about coding dojo

00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:10,100
who only one and how many parts paid

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,220
I think only world bow so I will present

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:18,590
this and I will say what is and what

00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:22,280
isn't coding dojo and to start dojo

00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:26,869
means a place that we train something

00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,869
like we fight something like karate and

00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:33,770
we as a programmer we need to practice

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:36,560
is something and it's not on a chip

00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:38,150
retsyn on true competition it's not a

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,750
competition or a show it's not a place

00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:47,079
that we show that we are best in each

00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:50,210
other or only to show our our potential

00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,570
the environment in a coded dojo session

00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:56,149
it's inclusive so everyone in the

00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:58,969
company can join in participate

00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:03,619
for example we are programmers but if

00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:07,729
someone of the HR team want you know or

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:11,329
learn about some language and lunch

00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:13,820
program they can join today's code

00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:16,690
reduce session and it's a safe place

00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,530
because if you don't know how to program

00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,530
you don't need to be shy

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:28,220
anyone in the recorded session of you

00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:32,240
worry about your limitations

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:35,150
or about your knowledge and it's very

00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,760
collaborative so everyone in they could

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,580
do session you share knowledge you will

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,280
be never alone

00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:46,390
so inaudible session we press a lot of

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,570
pen programming I will explain in the

00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:55,190
next slides how they methodology works

00:02:50,570 --> 00:03:00,440
but my program is essential in a chordal

00:02:55,190 --> 00:03:03,290
session and we press TDD is tests we do

00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,920
all based in tests as much as possible

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:08,930
and we write first all the tests that

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,200
will be fed because you don't have the

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:16,940
implementation yet and we will implement

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:19,310
until every test work and we will factor

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:22,850
the code because at the beginning our

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:27,560
code is so ugly so we need to look again

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:31,010
and do our best to have a good code so

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,420
if you don't do this something may

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:38,540
course goes wrong so if you don't know

00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:41,890
how to test to do tests participate of a

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:46,489
coding dojo session may help you a lot

00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:49,370
and as I said before we'll do step by

00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:54,830
step as small as possible we don't have

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:58,459
time to do huge things so we broke all

00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,610
the logic all this the game or whatever

00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:06,380
we do in a canoe session in small parts

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:09,080
and these parts will be will be doing is

00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,450
small as possible and the requirements

00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:15,170
to to do or to create recording those

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,979
dual session is to have a comfortable

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:24,140
meeting room that picture is I think in

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:27,050
Malaysia in one of our officers and a

00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:30,380
computer one computer per coding dojo

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:33,140
session and people like me like you that

00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:39,800
once you know more about codes and once

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:42,050
you know about more about TDD and at

00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,819
least all we

00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:46,550
every time that we have a go to do

00:04:43,819 --> 00:04:49,150
session we have some pizzas or something

00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:52,639
to it after the code into the session

00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:56,659
cotta is our exercise the means exercise

00:04:52,639 --> 00:05:00,169
there will be what we would do in the

00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:03,440
dosage because we have many types many

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:05,960
many kinds of cation and a coded

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,199
methodology I will explain the two most

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:13,610
interesting there is a hundred KTAR that

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,639
consists in a group of people that want

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:19,099
to chew participate a faculty dojo and

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,599
we have only one a computer in the room

00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:27,860
and we have a pilot and a co-pilot there

00:05:23,599 --> 00:05:30,319
we'll do a paid program until the time

00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:35,240
is over the time is between five and

00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:37,490
seven minutes and at that time one of

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,120
the audience you join should be a

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,479
co-pilot

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:44,500
the copilot will be a pilot and the part

00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:49,789
good should the audience and these flows

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:53,330
until everyone code in a packet is a

00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:56,060
little bit different a person or a

00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:59,569
person in a co-pilot you prepare

00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,580
anything before the presentation will do

00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:07,069
all the tests before and will present

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:09,139
step by step the exercise from the

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:13,759
beginning and to the end or until the

00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:16,699
times over these steps of a code version

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:22,060
coach the session is a problem choosing

00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:24,440
it's about five until 10 minutes before

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,680
and the problem discussion you will

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,389
create a to-do list of all white is

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:36,710
there will be tested in the session and

00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:38,990
then you start codes from one to two

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:41,629
hours it depends of the time that you

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:47,509
have with your friends of the of the

00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:50,300
company give to you and we do at

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:53,469
respective that we see what was good and

00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:56,180
what was bad in that time what we learn

00:06:53,469 --> 00:07:01,400
and what was not

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:04,789
so so good and we had a coldest session

00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:07,939
at relax in Lisbon was pretty nice

00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:11,719
in the beginning people are so shy

00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:15,349
because not everybody knows how to test

00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:16,969
and the first moment they said ah I just

00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:19,039
want to see I don't want to participate

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:22,699
because I don't know how to code very

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:28,120
well I don't know how to test but after

00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:31,129
we start people thought that is not so

00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:34,249
in an aggressive environment it's

00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:38,529
everyone is helping each other it's very

00:07:34,249 --> 00:07:41,990
good moments and the the problem is

00:07:38,529 --> 00:07:45,889
everyone is having together and everyone

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:50,960
is helping each other so we starting was

00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:53,809
pretty good we did using golang only one

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,960
person in the corridor session knows

00:07:53,809 --> 00:08:02,149
more about cooling but was pretty nice

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:05,240
and we learn now learnt a lot and as I

00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:07,699
said a little bit about our session yeah

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,319
and I open for questions I don't know if

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:14,839
you have curiosity about koji dojo but

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,490
see if you have I will try to explain my

00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:22,849
Angus as you are seen is not so good I

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:26,830
will try to do my best show to share a

00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,830
little bit so if you have questions

00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:41,529
the idea is a group from 8:00 until

00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:45,550
10:00 in the maximum you choose the idea

00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:50,410
create a game or create a system a small

00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:53,140
system and that's it it's not a language

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:56,260
basis you choose the language but the

00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:59,140
idea is not the language in itself you

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:10,779
see it should learn something or the

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:14,110
large core the new algorithm and yes

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:16,959
hecatomb is more groups do a challenge

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:19,660
and present that challenge but its

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:23,320
competition and in this case it's not a

00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:27,580
competition is to share knowledge mates

00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,709
so it don't don't mind if you don't know

00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:34,300
the language or don't know how to code

00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:37,240
but the only point that you need to show

00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:42,150
habits want to learn something new so

00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:45,300
it's a kind different of a hackathon

00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,300
that's it

00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:58,570
there is a website called kata exercise

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:01,120
or dojo Coty's

00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:05,440
there is many talks that you can choose

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,400
one and discuss with your friends and

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,740
after choose you start to develop that's

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:15,760
it I can share I will share on my

00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:19,680
Twitter a post that I did on medium that

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:23,110
I have many references about the subject

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,450
and in there there is a website so if

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:28,180
you main exercise that you can retrieve

00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:31,800
something information and some ideas to

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:36,490
do if your colleagues or at work maybe

00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:40,320
ok so feel free to follow me on Twitter

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:40,320
and thank you

00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,320
