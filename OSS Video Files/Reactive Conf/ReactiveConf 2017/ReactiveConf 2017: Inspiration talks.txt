you

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,760
so before we have David's

00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,860
and evident coming here I would love to

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,099
ask my guests as closer to you so I'm

00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,290
not that far away to introduce

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:30,150
yourselves hi everyone good morning my

00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,940
name is Shirley I am a freelance

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:36,809
software engineer and based in the San

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,059
Francisco Bay Area I specifically my

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:41,370
concentration is data visualization in

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,460
the web so I used a lot of d3.js

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,920
data-driven documents and react.js to do

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,790
what I do and a little bit about myself

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,930
I guess I went to UC Berkeley for

00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,400
business

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:58,530
I majored in business minored in

00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,900
computer science and then came out doing

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,670
big data like I went to a big data

00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,430
company and that's kind of how I fell

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:08,010
into data visualization I'm just excited

00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,720
to be here to like show you what data

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,220
visualization could do Oh awesome hi

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,420
everybody my name is John Wargo I work

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,700
for Microsoft I hard to describe what I

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,420
do I'm a program manager I'm working the

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,530
mobile space but I've got about 35 or 40

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,470
years experience as a professional

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,850
software developer and I've done things

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:31,890
are on enterprise development but like

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:36,690
said last ten twelve years so focused on

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:40,320
mobile so as I kind of think through the

00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:41,880
topic for today you know I I have I

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,260
think I have an interesting perspective

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,580
because I'm probably the oldest person

00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,990
here so I remember none of you know this

00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,659
but there was a time before there was

00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:55,650
Windows well the funny thing is we have

00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,790
the command line now for all the

00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,550
developer tools right well when I

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,170
started that's all you had so on

00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:05,520
interesting twist for me so thank you

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,979
very much Shirley let's start with you

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,659
I've read online that you've put an

00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:14,909
emoji my buzz campaign and Obama's face

00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:16,739
could you you know share a little bit

00:02:14,909 --> 00:02:19,590
more about that and clarify that if

00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,460
that's possible yeah I can I can help

00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:28,370
with the connectivity think easier

00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:30,680
I actually work on so I'm here because I

00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:34,730
gave a talk about how to use react and

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:38,630
z3 together but I also I'm I also do a

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:50,600
project okay so this is my website let's

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:52,610
be but I also do a project called data

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:57,470
sketches with my friend Nadia Bremer and

00:02:52,610 --> 00:03:00,530
what we do is we choose a topic yes

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:02,930
thank you we choose a topic and we

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:07,010
visualize it so we go get our own data

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:10,040
and we design we ID a and we code and we

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,330
write up our process so this is called I

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,230
don't know how you found that one that

00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,750
one's like a random one it's a it was a

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,150
project of 12 months and so this is the

00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:23,630
project page call it data sketches I'm

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,210
on the right hand side and Nadia's on

00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:28,700
the left hand side and so for the

00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:30,740
October month we decided we wanted to do

00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,260
something about the election early on

00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,640
and then as October approached I was

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,930
like hey Nadia I don't think I want

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,750
anything to do with this current

00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,730
election but then I realized I do want

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,680
to do something with Obama's because if

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,200
you have a president coming in you have

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,300
a president going out and I no matter

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,450
how you felt about his policies I quite

00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,310
enjoyed their like TV presences and so I

00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,210
went and got every single late-night

00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:58,940
interview there was of the Obamas off

00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:02,270
and so this is basically yes so this is

00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:06,860
every single one of them group by the

00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:09,350
host and this is them on the timeline so

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,570
you can see when the so this is already

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:15,520
really interesting so you can see that

00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:17,720
I'm the Obama kind of talked a lot in

00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,489
2009 when he first got office he's

00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,010
actually the first sitting president to

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:25,600
appear on late-night TV and then you can

00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:25,600
see in 2012 they picked up again

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,920
yeah but is it was it while he was

00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:41,250
president yeah really

00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:46,110
okay then Wikipedia lied to me somebody

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:51,210
somewhere on the internet lied to me

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:53,490
not surprising so uh yeah 2012 and then

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,980
picked up again for the 2016 elections

00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:58,710
and then you can see here's all of that

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,530
you can crisp on the YouTube videos and

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:06,000
then the part that you're talking about

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:07,800
is this part yes where essentially what

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,500
I did is I pulled all of the YouTube

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,240
videos I went and took a screenshot

00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,370
every single time somebody talks so I

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,990
got I went and gotten the captions I

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,850
took a screenshot every single time

00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:20,520
somebody talked I uploaded that those

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,110
screenshots to Google vision API who

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,770
gave me back all of this information

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,050
about like you know how like the how

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,970
happy they are or like if they're happy

00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:33,510
if they're sad if they're mad if they're

00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:36,290
wearing a hat um and like how confident

00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,850
they are that that's true and then so

00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,130
depending on that data I went and mapped

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,490
emojis onto their faces

00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:48,000
so the funniest part about it is that um

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:52,320
the story I feel like my favorite is

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,030
that let me find this one so I think

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,310
it's really funny because every time

00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,110
every single time Obama goes on to Jimmy

00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,820
Kimmel like basically every single one

00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,919
of them is like Jimmy's smiling like

00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,840
really really wide and like Obama is

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,450
just like usual face so like if you go

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,310
through any of these it's basically it's

00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:10,740
basically every single one of these is

00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:14,100
the exact same like with Jimmy laughing

00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,330
and then like Obama just he's being

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,320
presidential he's being very

00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,390
presidential

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,360
thank you yeah this is the one you were

00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,479
mentioning yes exactly

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:26,550
this is like a random one and the one

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,100
that people usually know me for is this

00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:32,220
one it's it's called in terms of

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,930
interactive visualization of every line

00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:35,610
and the musical Hamilton and each of

00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,259
these dots are a different

00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:39,599
lyrics and then you can go through and

00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:44,280
you can read my analysis and then at the

00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,349
very end I also have this filter tool so

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,879
that you can do your own analysis so

00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:52,979
this is what people usually find me with

00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:55,530
yes you see me try to different day and

00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:57,780
now I'd left to introduce the two

00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:59,310
speakers that we're running a little bit

00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:01,650
late which is completely okay because we

00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,419
have an hour for this session so that

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:05,280
shouldn't be a problem so on my

00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:13,710
right-hand side I would like to welcome

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:15,060
hem on you and okay see if you can do a

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,930
little bit of an introduction of

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,319
yourselves

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,150
what do you do what's your company doing

00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,440
or what's your what's your biggest

00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,729
achievement that you're writing working

00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:29,159
on hi everyone my name is Evan having

00:07:26,729 --> 00:07:31,650
you and I currently work on

00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:34,949
I'm the altar of ejs I currently work on

00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:38,400
maintaining the framework full-time and

00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:41,069
that's like made available to sponsors

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,830
and our patreon campaign open collective

00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:46,550
so it's a completely community driven

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:50,029
and full-time open source which is a

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:53,400
being very great experience so far

00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:55,500
before working full-time on bjs I was at

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:59,159
meteor development group working on

00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:01,949
meteor framework and before that I was

00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:04,979
at Google Creative Lab we worked on a

00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:08,339
lot of interactive prototypes internal

00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:10,650
experiments which unfortunately I don't

00:08:08,339 --> 00:08:14,310
have much to show because like most of

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:16,860
them are still confidential but yeah

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,440
that's pretty much my story uh full-time

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:24,330
open source which is pretty fun that's a

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,849
cool gig give it I am David Nolan I've

00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:29,759
been doing front end sort of dev stuff

00:08:26,849 --> 00:08:32,490
with JavaScript since like 2005 so like

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,560
twelve years of UI work um I was at the

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:35,909
New York Times of four years doing news

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,530
apps in the newsroom

00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:42,170
I was pretty cool we're doing you know

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,000
javascript with rails there I network

00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:46,160
for a company called cognitive and the

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,450
lead developer of closure script so

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,970
close your script is a version of

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:52,070
closure that compiles to JavaScript

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,990
that's just closures a functional

00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:55,640
programming language for the java

00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,140
virtual machine I also worked on de

00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,740
Tomic which is also a cognate tech

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:02,570
product which is a sort of novel

00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,560
immutable relational database I don't

00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,980
think there's anything else really like

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,870
it

00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:08,780
I talked a bit about that the conference

00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:11,810
and yeah that's what I do some software

00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:16,090
jerk architected we work with big

00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:16,090
companies governments on hard problems

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,440
thank you David

00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:23,060
today the topic is less about technology

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,310
but more about the story the personal

00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,010
story behind that of what what driven

00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:30,530
you what was the passion behind getting

00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:35,390
into the field that you're right now in

00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:37,010
and you know what started the the path

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,770
that you're right now walking on with

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,660
with the with the engineering and

00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:44,180
technology and I want to you know move

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,490
our attention to to John because you've

00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:48,560
mentioned to me that you've written six

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,870
books on mobile development and one book

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,410
on so a soccer referee or football

00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:55,640
referee which is a rather unique

00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:57,020
combination so I would really be

00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,880
interested how it did you transition

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,020
from being a soccer referee into into

00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,220
engineering interestingly the soccer for

00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,040
the software engineering heaven first

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:09,470
okay um but the book on soccer reffering

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,260
happened first before the other ones so

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,040
um so I was a developer for really long

00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:18,620
time the first computer had was at Texas

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:23,330
Instruments TI 99 for a ever heard of

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:26,450
that yeah so okay but anyways it got

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,890
involved in running software but in the

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:31,910
days where everything was proprietary

00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:33,530
all the IDs were for fee all of the

00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:36,760
software that I use you had to pay for

00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:38,930
it was really kind of bizarre but then I

00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,820
started working more on open source and

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:43,520
doing things like that but the to the

00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,710
book thing everybody wants to write a

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,510
book so everyone says um already book

00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,650
someday and nobody ever does right how

00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:50,600
many of you ever write a book something

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,129
yeah how many of you back to reading

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,160
book

00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:58,189
yeah what happened was I was a soccer

00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,720
referee for 22 years and as I retired as

00:10:58,189 --> 00:11:00,889
I walked out of my last referee meeting

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,199
I said to myself I write a book about

00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:03,920
this and then I actually forced myself

00:11:03,199 --> 00:11:06,350
to do it

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,449
and I took a week's vacation I wrote a

00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:12,470
book I self-published it I sold I don't

00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:15,499
have ten copies but what's interesting

00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,579
is used to work for blackberry and as I

00:11:15,499 --> 00:11:17,569
was leaving black bear I'm like you know

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:20,350
there aren't any books on blackberry

00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:22,550
development I'm gonna write one and I

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,259
went to the folks of blackberry said hey

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,759
gene domain publishers are looking to

00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:26,899
have someone write a book and they go

00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,249
yeah as a matter of fact we do let me

00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:31,009
introduce you and when I got introduced

00:11:28,249 --> 00:11:33,410
to the publisher the publisher said oh

00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,149
you've already written a book cool okay

00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,100
I'll sign you up and here's why the

00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,860
biggest problem that publishers have is

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:41,720
getting authors who sign a contract and

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,459
get in advance and commit to a deadline

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,319
biggest problem I have is actually

00:11:43,459 --> 00:11:47,029
getting them to write the book so the

00:11:45,319 --> 00:11:50,600
fact that I already had a book under my

00:11:47,029 --> 00:11:53,119
belt again five copies sold was enough

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,350
to motivate this guy to give me a huge

00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:57,019
amount of money in advance

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,579
it wasn't get me going there baby so

00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,319
that's how the two happened so I was a

00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:03,170
software developer forever

00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:04,879
the soccer everything was something I

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:06,920
did just because I wanted to I wanted to

00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,499
get back right kind of open-sourcing on

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,269
the soccer refereeing side but it

00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,589
enabled me to write my first mobile

00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,540
development book which is the first book

00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:16,040
on blackberry development but then from

00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,959
that point forward it was easy and then

00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,809
the best part of it is no one's looked

00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:21,980
at my resume in like 15 years because

00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,029
it's like oh you wrote the book on

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:25,309
blackberry development yeah you're hired

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:28,009
so they have absolutely no idea and you

00:12:25,309 --> 00:12:29,389
think about me or my color my books but

00:12:28,009 --> 00:12:31,490
they know that I've written four books

00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:34,939
in Apache Cordova I probably know I'm

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,290
magic perova your hired the best advice

00:12:34,939 --> 00:12:37,910
I can give you is make a name for

00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:41,660
yourself and then no one will ever look

00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:46,009
at your resume ever again I think that's

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,839
a great advice I want to start with what

00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:49,279
David on the other side what's your

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,100
story well how did she get where you're

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,369
right now and

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,709
what propelled you there so my story is

00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:59,889
a bit funny as I I don't have any formal

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:01,869
education in cs3 a bit of science no my

00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:04,749
parents bought a computer in 1988 after

00:13:01,869 --> 00:13:06,369
gs I learned how to program on that and

00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:08,920
so my brother died were just like

00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:10,720
hobbyists like Pascal C C++ were just

00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,879
completely self-taught I went to school

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,290
for film yeah so I went to film school

00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:18,819
and then um well I don't know the Ron

00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:21,549
2004 I went it was back in grad school

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:23,499
for new media at NYU I was like oh yeah

00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:25,029
programming is pretty fun and so I

00:13:23,499 --> 00:13:27,069
started were having like getting back

00:13:25,029 --> 00:13:28,959
into programming and then my first job I

00:13:27,069 --> 00:13:30,279
actually got my first job when I was

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,619
only halfway through grad school and I

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,589
was working for Princeton University I'm

00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:38,069
working on a vital statistics u.s.

00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:40,839
census project was a mapping project and

00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:44,470
yeah there's like just I got that on

00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,749
Craigslist that was a job guys yeah and

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:48,790
the rest is history it was just I really

00:13:46,749 --> 00:13:50,850
I discovered that there's actually a

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:53,439
connection between sort of cinema and

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:55,119
you I work the thing I really loved is

00:13:53,439 --> 00:13:57,519
that you know when you do work on films

00:13:55,119 --> 00:13:59,470
it was I'm also a musician but the point

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,059
is you create an experience you create

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,170
an experience for the for the for the

00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:04,689
for the audience that you're interested

00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,249
in and um that was what I really liked

00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:08,049
about UI programming and I stuck with

00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:09,759
that for a very long time and I still do

00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:12,069
I mean that's mostly what I do I do

00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,220
other things as well um but yeah my path

00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:18,819
was very roundabout very very circuitous

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:21,429
yeah Kevin what about you I actually

00:14:18,819 --> 00:14:23,559
have a lot to do like your path

00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:26,230
resonates with me a lot because I have a

00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:27,670
very similar situation where I honors

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,799
underground my major was like art

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:34,360
history and and after graduating you

00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,980
know like all my friends are like either

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,830
doing econ or math

00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:42,220
or like just hardcore engineering and I

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,860
was like like I was trying to look for a

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,080
job for our history and it's like you

00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,690
know it's just like there's no way right

00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,180
like I wasn't so I was born in China and

00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,400
went to US for college and really I was

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,410
just like I didn't really think about

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,820
thinking through about like finding a

00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,710
job so that I can keep staying you

00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,840
speaks like obviously you need to get a

00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,420
like h-1b visa so that you can keep

00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:06,040
working there but like there's no art

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:10,330
related job that it would give you an

00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,240
h-1b sounds like oh okay I do so go into

00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:15,700
so I went to Parsons there is a happy

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,460
program like design technology I think

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:22,090
it's pretty much similar to ITP

00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:25,090
and so that was also the place where it

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:27,820
kind of so I used to play with flash lot

00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:29,710
in middle school high school and but

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,720
that was I played with flash mostly

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,850
because of like building these

00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,220
experiences rather than like the the

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:39,670
programming aspect of it but after I got

00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:41,560
back into the program I did the select

00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:44,920
program involve old programming and

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,730
design and interactive experiences or

00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,860
just more artistic use of technology it

00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,110
was really interesting and fun but it

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,130
also kind of got me back into like

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:59,110
programming and at that time Google just

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,240
like went out within like chrome

00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,920
experiments and it was like wow that's

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,440
crazy now other days you can do these

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:08,560
kind of like fancy interactive stuff in

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,660
the browser with JavaScript like time to

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,970
learn the language so that's how I got

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,790
into JavaScript and I just like bought

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,230
the book like the the Rhino book just

00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:20,020
reading through on my weight on my

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:21,490
commute and it's like cool this is the

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,180
bone language so I started playing with

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:28,020
it I got some interactive demos and yeah

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,340
so when I graduated somehow I just like

00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,900
someone at Google Creative Lab just like

00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,670
noticed some of my stuff and they're

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,320
like hey do you want to work here like

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:42,280
yeah oh yeah so that was my first job

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,500
actually we did a lot of like so

00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,690
Creative Lab is a pretty unique place

00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,889
where it's this mix of designers

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,589
filmmakers

00:16:47,889 --> 00:16:54,819
directors and creative technologists and

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:56,709
we did a lot of prototypes experiments

00:16:54,819 --> 00:17:00,790
superfast spring inside just like

00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:03,399
cramming out I crazy ideas it was super

00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:06,100
fun and that was also the era the the

00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:08,740
period where I kind of start to get into

00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,659
a bit more serious engineering side of

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,049
things figuring out how to build things

00:17:10,659 --> 00:17:16,329
better and faster and that was the

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:19,500
period where I started working on view

00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:24,100
just as a sort of personal experiment

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:26,740
and I was like one that four years ago

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,809
and view back then it was just really

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,970
just a small thing never had the

00:17:28,809 --> 00:17:35,019
intention to make it say like compete

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:38,440
with reactor angular but more people

00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,630
started using it and I put it up on

00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,279
github and people who started star in it

00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:46,090
I was like maybe there's something to it

00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:48,580
and really like it's a it's a long

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,529
process like my commitment to it is just

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:54,159
like gradually increasing to the point

00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:55,600
where I felt like I should I should just

00:17:54,159 --> 00:17:58,210
figure out a way to do this full-time

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,730
otherwise it's it's you know I enjoy

00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:02,950
doing it but like having to do it

00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:06,610
outside of a full-time day job is just

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:10,000
like too much to be sustainable and I

00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:13,360
was like yeah why just try this cuz I

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,799
saw Dan Abramov actually did a small

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,529
patron campaign when he was working on

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,269
react uploader and I was like sounds

00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:22,929
like an interesting model maybe we can

00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:26,320
try it for view and so when I started I

00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:28,480
didn't I felt like it's so if you only

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,059
rely on small like personal donations

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,130
it's probably not gonna be like actually

00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:34,620
sustainable for a full-time job but

00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,889
there was luckily there was this company

00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:40,570
that I know their CTO and he's a friend

00:18:38,889 --> 00:18:42,789
of mine and they have this budget for

00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,190
open source sponsorship they're like

00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,260
what response are you for six months for

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:49,659
two thousand dollars every month so that

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,429
you can get started so that was like

00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:54,760
really a big help in the initial phase

00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:56,769
of just like giving me the you know the

00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:59,670
courage to just take the job and try to

00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:02,160
do it full-time and then it just

00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:05,700
went pretty well after that and today

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,920
it's fully sustainable and I'm I'm

00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,990
actually just having a pretty good life

00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,630
work balance I I'm able to just work on

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:14,400
open source work as an actual job and

00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,920
still have time team juice you know

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,370
enjoy family and do other things so

00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:25,020
that's great that's a great story in a

00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,640
interesting way how to get into open

00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:29,340
source that you get this opportunity to

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,410
actually jump the ship as we would say

00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:33,150
and then try it for half a year and and

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,440
that probably motivates you that you

00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:36,150
know the time is running out and you

00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,260
need to start making a little bit of

00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:42,230
revenue that so it works nicely surely

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,720
what about shilling how did you get into

00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,340
putting a emoji face on Obama like where

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,490
does it start to get to them they're

00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,130
just I'm really really curious yeah

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,870
learning history yeah well actually sue

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,690
I don't know how to follow all of that

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,490
because there's like so many my story is

00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,850
like very similar to what everybody said

00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:04,320
which is that I actually as I was not

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:07,080
more in China but my parents are Chinese

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,450
and we came to the US and I studied

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,280
business and undergrad and I intended to

00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:13,710
go into finance I intended to go into

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,020
the investment banking and then junior

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,610
year the summer after junior because you

00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:25,820
know that's a very Asian thing to do

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:28,230
money but I a summer after junior year I

00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,440
did go into an investment banking

00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:34,530
internship and I realized how absolutely

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,240
miserable I was there and then that was

00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:39,080
like I kind of had like a quarter life

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:44,250
crisis in college where I realized that

00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:47,370
for 21 20 21 years of my life I have

00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:49,590
followed exactly what other people told

00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:51,000
me I should be doing so I went through

00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:52,590
school I went through you know high

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,360
school taking all the classes that

00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:55,950
people told me I should take getting the

00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:58,620
grace that people told me I should take

00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:59,610
or get and I went to the college that

00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,860
you know people told me where

00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:03,870
prestigious and I should go to and then

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,500
when I got through the college I decided

00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:07,360
to study business and

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:09,460
as everybody wanted to do invest make

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,350
investment making because that's the

00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:14,500
most prestigious thing and I kind of

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:16,990
just followed that like wave along for

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,760
all of that time and I like you know the

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,680
moment at which I should have felt the

00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:22,720
most accomplished because I have landed

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,120
myself a good internship at a good

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,060
company and I realized that I was

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,010
absolutely miserable because I wasn't

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,070
doing what I like which is that when I

00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:35,470
was a child I loved making things right

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:37,330
like I loved like I I grew up partially

00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:39,610
in Japan that they had like a great like

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,230
arts and crafts program in elementary

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,760
school and I would like to woodworking

00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,980
and we would like you know build things

00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,440
out of like actual physical things and

00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:48,820
they realized I have lost that some time

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,790
and like a middle school in high school

00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:53,620
in college and I was just chasing this

00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:55,330
like empty figure of like you know

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:56,980
prestige and accomplishment and all of

00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,900
that and then when I went to the

00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,940
investment bank I realized like all I

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:08,740
was doing was like entering things into

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:11,740
so that like I you could you could write

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:14,530
code to do this so I wrote vba code to

00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,390
do like I automated everything so like

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:18,460
this thing that like you know took that

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:20,620
analyst like three hours every Monday I

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:22,870
wrote like I spent three hours like my

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,330
first week writing like this vba code

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:28,090
and automated it and then like after

00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:30,580
that like every single Monday I just

00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:33,460
kind of like like sat in the Bloomberg

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:42,690
terminal in front of the and then like

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:42,690
ran the script and pretend it was like

00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,230
maybe I should be doing something else

00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,910
and so I had started taking CS classes

00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:54,850
my junior year my second semester junior

00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:57,370
year just for fun cuz I was almost done

00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,810
with my business major so I was like oh

00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:00,370
be fine if I can't like you know a

00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:02,590
double major or a minor or some things

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:04,630
so I started taking CS classes and in

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,420
that summer I realized like how much

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:09,430
more I loved my CS classes just because

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,680
even though I wasn't making something

00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:13,720
tangible I'm still making something in

00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,820
debt like I was still building something

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:16,950
instead of like entering something into

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,960
Excel like

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:21,660
investment banking is a service-oriented

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,390
like industry right sooo I'm not

00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:26,850
actually creating anything I'm just

00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:29,460
helping push money around which i think

00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:31,170
is really good for certain things but

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,000
like it just wasn't what made me happy

00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,860
so I like my into this like slight

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,480
depressive spiral and then I figure

00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,010
myself out by the end of the summer and

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,410
I was like I'm gonna do something like

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:42,360
and I'm gonna do software like I'm going

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:44,340
to graduate next year and do software

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:47,280
engineering my parents were like are you

00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,990
crazy thank you you went through three

00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,640
years to telling us that you're gonna do

00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:52,080
finance and you're going to switch to

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:56,970
computer science and nobody's going to

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,980
hire you and I'm like watch me I went

00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,900
and I killed myself senior year like

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,910
getting I think I liked it like three do

00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,990
the hardest courses and like one

00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:06,510
semester and people are like you're

00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:11,120
crazy and I'm like I know I am and then

00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:13,230
my last semester in college I went out

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,790
and like you know did all of those

00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,220
recruiting things trying to get into

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:18,990
these companies you have to realize that

00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:20,790
like I went to Berkeley and everybody

00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,010
bite that had hot like all of my friends

00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:25,050
already had job offers I like investment

00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,730
banks are like you know Google or Airbnb

00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,320
or uber or like any of those big places

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:30,030
or like they were going to med school I

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,070
like you or like you know like all of

00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:35,160
these big places and I'm just over there

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,600
being like hi my name is Shirley like

00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,030
can you please just give me an interview

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,090
I knew I have no experience and software

00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:44,430
whatsoever and I only have like two

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:46,020
semesters of coursework but will you

00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,480
give me an interview and most places

00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,020
like didn't even look at my resume but

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,020
then I

00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:01,410
I didn't write a book but what I didn't

00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:03,420
said was um I have friends that were

00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:05,340
like really supportive me and so they

00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:08,100
were like you know I would randomly they

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:10,080
like tell me hey there's a panel of like

00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:12,690
industry leaders you should go bring

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,060
your resume and so like I remember

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:17,760
distinctly the first full-time job I got

00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,070
I got it because right after the panel

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,010
one of the like one of the VP's said hey

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:26,010
were hiring talk to me after if you're

00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:30,270
interested so I like be mine like ran to

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:31,920
him right after like the panel and like

00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:34,860
he was like you know in line to get food

00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:36,900
I'm like I like went to him I like was

00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,480
like Blakey God I'm Shirley here's my

00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:43,410
resume and then I realized that nobody

00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,090
else like here just me but he like

00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,520
interviewed me on the spot and then I

00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:49,500
got another interview and then they gave

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,110
me an offer and I actually got another

00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:55,080
offer from another place where it was a

00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:58,560
very similar story so what I realized

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,480
was that nobody you know nobody gave me

00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:02,130
an interview because of my resume but

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,650
what they did give me an interview for

00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:07,440
was when I took that initiative to tell

00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:09,660
them I hate here's me this is my story I

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,330
did finance but I realized this isn't

00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:15,000
for me and I really really really really

00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:17,160
want to do software and it's because I'm

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,760
in love with coding and I realized this

00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:25,370
and please give me a chance and I knew I

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:28,350
don't have experience but I'm being oh

00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:30,750
no worries that wasn't me that was I

00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:33,360
knew I don't have any much and like any

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:36,330
experience but I'm I'm a quick learner

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,920
and they gave me a job and that first

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,910
one was spunk I don't know if anybody's

00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,700
heard of it

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,160
um but Splunk gave me a job as a

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,070
front-end engineer I had a great manager

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:50,100
he told me to go learn c3 he mentored me

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:52,640
I can went to my second job where I led

00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:56,250
a project building a data visualization

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,350
like kind of framework to do I you know

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,900
from the ground up I had a lot of

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:01,720
responsibilities and then about a year

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,990
ago I decided

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,180
two year and a half ago I realized I

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:08,710
have made a good amount of a name for

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,260
myself in the data visualization

00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,240
community that I could afford to go

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,890
freelancing because this is something I

00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:17,440
have always wanted to try and wanted

00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,750
that freedom for myself to kind of work

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,190
and learn and make things that I am

00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:23,050
passionate about instead of what

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,790
somebody else is passionate about and

00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:26,110
it's been about a year and a half and

00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:29,770
it's been really great and I just

00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:32,290
realized also that I'm I didn't even

00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:34,780
realize it sometime but freelancing how

00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:36,520
ridiculous of an idea it is that

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:39,010
somebody else is in control of my time

00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,950
that I have to go to my boss to like ask

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:46,530
for PTO stuff so then freely yet so

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:49,170
that's actually another that's my story

00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:52,240
thank you very much

00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:54,040
this should be an ALC I probably forgot

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,010
to mention it but a audience

00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,290
participation part as well so you know

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:02,380
so you're all here you're listening to

00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:03,910
these guys and girls and it would be

00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:07,960
great to get your questions and get your

00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:10,030
thoughts and you know to answer them as

00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,070
well we still have a half an hour for

00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:14,470
that and in the meanwhile I see that the

00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,540
fern Kline surprisingly became the line

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:18,670
of the speakers of the conference which

00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:24,100
I would love to welcome here as well so

00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:28,030
I guess say hi guys and there's Tom

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,700
Gavin Victor Thiago and Gabe and these

00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:35,110
guys also gave a talk yesterday before

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:37,060
on their development so we can also add

00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,550
them into the discussion if they're

00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:43,330
interested and it's a resounding yes

00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:46,480
there so I like that and also ask them

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:48,400
the questions so hopefully the first one

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,400
there so the name of the game is there

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:54,960
no wrong questions so ask anything in

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,960
the worst case I'm gonna say no

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,650
absolutely let me have a question before

00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:03,970
you jump in and start stealing the mic

00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:05,350
all right well the one thing I want to

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,930
say is I listen everybody talking as I

00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:10,690
saw everyone this week recognize that

00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:13,150
all of us are doing exactly what we want

00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,590
to do right we have a day job and

00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:15,510
someone

00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:18,059
pays us in there boss kinda tells us

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,590
what to do most of the time but all of

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,630
us have found something that's really

00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:23,370
really interesting and we've stuck with

00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:25,710
it and we thought if we found someone to

00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,370
pay us money to do it right that's the

00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,900
important thing

00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:29,250
and I promised myself a long time ago

00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:31,230
that if I ever wake up in the morning

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,820
and dread going to work I'm not gonna go

00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,250
to work anymore and so every time I've

00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,570
been in a job where I've not liked what

00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,190
I've done or I've dreaded going to work

00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:39,960
I've quit and I've gone on to find

00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:41,460
something else and then that's another

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,720
way that you get new skills or your

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:44,580
pivot in your career and things like

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:47,190
that so I just want to add that based

00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,360
upon what everybody else in Joe thank I

00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,980
think that's a very important thing

00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,149
especially for the younger people here

00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:53,669
that are is still looking and searching

00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:55,679
for the the right right start for it for

00:29:53,669 --> 00:30:02,520
where to go whether it's a new Vista

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:08,760
banking or anything else yes oh oh give

00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:10,440
you the mic so I just wanted to have

00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,799
that you know you hear about these sort

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,830
of big tech employers and it's you know

00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:19,950
it sounds very glamorous to work for one

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:21,809
but the reason that I am at Google is I

00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:23,850
was hacking on JavaScript in my spare

00:30:21,809 --> 00:30:25,679
time and they hired me as a JavaScript

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:27,390
engineer even though I was doing C++

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,130
every day working on you know Linux

00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,840
systems and so forth so they they hired

00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:34,440
me because I was doing something that I

00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:36,630
gave it gave a about yeah and that

00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,600
was that became the unusual valuable

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:41,909
skill at the time they hired me so you

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,770
guys absolutely should follow follow

00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:46,230
what you're interested in and not pursue

00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:48,690
some some goal of something that just

00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:50,010
sounds like it would sound good so well

00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:52,169
and you can find a way to get someone to

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:54,750
pay you to do what you want to do if it

00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:56,909
if what if what you do is interesting

00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,590
enough or cool enough you can find a way

00:30:56,909 --> 00:31:02,840
right Evan you can find a way for

00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,840
someone to pay to do what you want to do

00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:07,620
yeah I would like to also add Tom into

00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,840
the discussion since you're already

00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:12,750
sitting here this story with that is

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,370
they wrote LinkedIn calm they wrote it

00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:16,200
as an ember app and then they were like

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:18,860
oh we should probably hire some people

00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,860
who know how to use this

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,890
but I think that actually at least an

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,480
interesting point which is I would for

00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:27,460
people who are here if you are not

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,340
involved in an open-source project like

00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,200
but I have so many deeply rewarding

00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,640
professional relationships and people

00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,280
that work at companies that are

00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,130
ostensibly competitors you know like I

00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,480
have so many great conversations with

00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,910
people who would be considered

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,080
competition but I feel like the luckiest

00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,520
person in the world because we're all

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,320
working this like very exciting space

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:51,070
and sharing ideas collaboratively we get

00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:52,870
paid very well and so many of the people

00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,460
that I've enjoyed working with down the

00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:56,980
line we did become co-workers that we

00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:59,170
did become fellow employees and and for

00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:00,520
my career every good job I've ever had

00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,370
has been do the people I've met through

00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:05,590
open source so if you're not involved I

00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:11,440
really recommend it if only for the

00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:16,120
money will eventually lead to do open

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:17,980
source be rich ok so let's do it Paul

00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,670
like who's above you is involving an

00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:23,080
open-source project in your computer's

00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:26,800
so who's using open source thank you

00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:29,600
very much ok that's a good one and who's

00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:34,980
gonna give me back and what about giving

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:37,540
[Laughter]

00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:39,610
who's contributing the open source

00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:42,280
projects oh no no it should be the same

00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:46,000
number of hands it should be the same

00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:48,250
number of hands so I I actually felt

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,260
inferiority complex because like I'm

00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,020
obviously not like Evan or Tom or like

00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,450
I'm not contributing to like like the

00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,250
actual source code of opens like open

00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:59,740
source libraries right but can I just

00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:02,050
say that I think it's just as cool if

00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,240
like you're using these open source

00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,830
libraries and you're either you know

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,850
contributing with your projects like

00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:08,770
you're you're putting it out there

00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,900
you're making your own projects open

00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:12,940
source you're inspiring others to like

00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,800
kind of like show them what you can do

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,690
with these libraries I think that's cool

00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:19,270
too I think that couldn't like count as

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:21,340
contributing to open source also so I

00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:23,080
feel like if you're using that just like

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,300
you said you should also keep your hand

00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:27,610
up yeah so um answer questions on forums

00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:30,130
is giving back writing the documentation

00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:31,059
is giving back identifying an issue and

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,639
submitting it to the team

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,259
fix that's giving back every one of your

00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,519
hand should be up as contributing

00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:38,559
open-source because if your is

00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:41,230
self-fulfilling right if you're using it

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:53,820
you need to help make more event sorry

00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:56,110
yes I mean questions exactly

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:57,640
I've taken over by the way I'm gonna try

00:33:56,110 --> 00:34:00,509
I guess

00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,970
[Laughter]

00:34:00,509 --> 00:34:09,819
so do you have copies you I'm sure you

00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:23,379
have questions don't be shy I will run

00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:26,349
to you I just wanted to ask a question

00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:29,020
about I know we're in a university but

00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:33,149
and I have a university background as

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:37,349
well but more and more you see these big

00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:40,060
or you say Twitter personalities and

00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:44,200
people in the opens open source space

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:47,829
that don't have computer science degree

00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:55,780
and they're very successful nowadays do

00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:58,810
you do you think that it's still

00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:01,450
mandatory to go through computer science

00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:03,630
do you think more and more companies

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:06,190
around the world will start seeing that

00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,770
professional experience and contributing

00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:11,800
to open source is maybe a better way and

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:15,339
more fruitfully so i have a degree in

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:21,760
physics so thats exists almost computer

00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:24,329
science well my story's not as good as

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,260
tom's but my degree is in filmmaking

00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:28,000
computers getting a computer science

00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:30,460
degree is a much more efficient way to

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,990
learn computers then learning it on the

00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,150
job so if you're in a computer science

00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,510
program that's good it'll save you a lot

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,460
of time but it's not required tom

00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:42,480
stories better my degree is in

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,480
criminology which

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,799
but I think I think there's a little bit

00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:55,289
of confirmation bias in some sense

00:35:52,799 --> 00:35:57,000
because I think people who are on the

00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:59,190
like speaking circuit and have a passion

00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,490
for creating things tend to have an

00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,410
action a bias for action and I think I

00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:06,960
think it's less that those people are

00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,950
like I think they're just impatient

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,569
people who don't have the patience to

00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:11,670
sit through like a four-year university

00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:12,930
of course possibly this is paying the

00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:16,079
price and I don't think that's

00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:19,140
necessarily a good personality trait but

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:22,859
that said I know for me it certainly has

00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:24,900
been I felt a loss you know I felt like

00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:26,730
I had some catch up to do because I

00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,049
didn't have it and if if you have the

00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,420
ability to go through that course I

00:36:28,049 --> 00:36:33,960
would recommend it like it definitely

00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:38,670
would have come in handy let's ask the

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:40,230
speaker's right here well I don't here's

00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,910
the thing having a fear science degree

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,190
like you said is a streamlined way to

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:46,260
get to it which is great but if you if

00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,520
you were able to analyze all the open

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,770
source projects or all the different

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,109
solutions we have out there how many of

00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,690
them came to be because the person had

00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:56,369
an external perspective that a computer

00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:59,789
science degree would not have given them

00:36:56,369 --> 00:37:01,740
so Evan what we did the view come from

00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:03,180
some computer science thing or you were

00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,160
just musing about how hard it was to

00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:08,809
solve a problem and you applied some

00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,809
external view to it and solved it right

00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:16,500
I'm just gonna say really quick that I'm

00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:18,299
I think there are some things that I'm

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,490
really grateful for for having that

00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:21,210
minor I I'm really grateful for having

00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,950
the Compu

00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:24,990
like computer science foundations that

00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,869
theory just because even though I don't

00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,970
use it in my day to day it still helps

00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:31,710
me like it helps inform like my

00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,329
decisions on like say performance on

00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:35,640
like memory allocation and all of that

00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:39,529
and that I'm just really grateful to

00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,270
have had before I went into full time

00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:45,150
having said that I think it's completely

00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:47,099
it's I think a really great thing I also

00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,480
agree on the confirmation bias because I

00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,130
feel like a lot of the people that are

00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,810
on the speaker circuit and stuff are

00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:53,670
really really passionate about what

00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,350
they're doing precisely because they

00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:57,300
went through life doing something else

00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:59,730
then they found computer science and

00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:02,340
realize how much they loved it and then

00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:04,500
they want to really share it and I think

00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:05,970
but there's a like you know thousands

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,220
and millions of people that went through

00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:09,840
like computer science and like they like

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,580
their job and they they you know are

00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:13,830
working out really great job is doing

00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:15,870
really great things that you know aren't

00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:18,120
out there speaking but that's just this

00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:19,860
great especially if they're really happy

00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,900
with it I think it's just like Tom

00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:24,330
Selleck maybe we just have a little bit

00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:26,880
more impatient of a personality but I'm

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:29,730
I think to me the most important thing

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,080
is that if you don't haven't done a

00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:32,730
computer science degree and it's

00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:35,400
something that you want to get into I

00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:38,670
think the self learning part is really

00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,140
really important because you know you to

00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:43,290
teach yourself all of the things that

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,550
you didn't get in college or in some

00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:46,170
sort of a course of boot camp or

00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:49,410
something and the second thing is that

00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:52,020
um the crushing amount of impostor

00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:53,370
syndrome when we start out at the

00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,530
beginning I don't know I feel like this

00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:58,320
is a very common theme but like when I

00:38:55,530 --> 00:39:03,210
first like you know graduated went into

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:05,340
like a full-time position the amount

00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:08,070
that I drove myself to learn everything

00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:10,260
that I can't because I felt like I was

00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,180
so behind because I felt so stupid

00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,060
amongst my co-workers for not knowing

00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,630
like you know a breach like OS systems

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,950
or knowing more algorithms or and I feel

00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,390
like this is a very common trait for

00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,590
people that didn't study computer

00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:24,300
science so I think those are the two

00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:31,050
things that if you do decide on that

00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:34,560
path be prepared for um so for me so my

00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,900
major was art history I took like two

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:39,480
computer science classes one was like

00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,120
completely dummy intro like everyone

00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,620
just like writing HDMI and CSS and the

00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:46,770
the final project was just like make a

00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:49,050
website and the second one was like more

00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:52,650
like data structures and algorithms in

00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:55,020
Java and add that back then like I had a

00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:57,300
hard time Blake just going through that

00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,030
course because at that time I had like

00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:02,080
no intention to pursue a career that has

00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,940
anything to do with software engineering

00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:06,160
and to me I was just trying to fulfill

00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:08,350
the curriculum requirements so like I

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,150
just have to pass its course and what

00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:13,840
the hell is this like linked list thing

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:17,410
that I have to flip or whatever and but

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:20,620
like it's only after I started doing

00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:23,950
more creative programming in the browser

00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,960
and sometimes I have to actually use

00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:28,240
some of the these things that I learned

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:30,070
before in and I go back to it I'm like

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,330
this now looks much much more

00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:36,430
interesting than like two years ago and

00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:39,430
now if I opened the old textbook that I

00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:41,170
had when I was in college like it's

00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:42,910
actually something that I could sit

00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,860
there and just keep reading it but I

00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:46,900
back then I have to like force myself to

00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,510
like dude go through a whole nine I just

00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:51,280
went to like five pages or something and

00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:53,860
I think it's really like for me

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,980
personally I'm an extremely like goal

00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:59,320
driven and end result driven so for me

00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:01,120
what actually pushed me through to like

00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,720
learning things is really like I said

00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:07,270
something to in my mind first I like I

00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:09,820
want to build this thing I want to build

00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:11,500
say a website I want to build this like

00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,280
special visual effect I want to build

00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:17,080
this very mark and then I set out to to

00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,450
fake to analyze the thing and figure out

00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:21,370
like what are the things that I'm

00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:25,300
currently lacking and I just go there

00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:26,980
and learn it and I think that's that's

00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:29,500
the way I have progressed so far and I

00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,360
don't think like so so the cool thing

00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,870
about a computer science degree is you

00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:36,460
have someone who who's being far deeper

00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:38,830
in the field to design the curriculum

00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,330
for you and sort of lay out the the

00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,920
things that kind of helps you progress

00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:45,130
through the more advanced concepts

00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,770
though that saves a lot of time but if

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:50,020
you didn't have a strong like passion or

00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:52,060
goal that's driving you to go through

00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:54,760
those things you might be like wondering

00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:57,850
like am I really like in for this but

00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:59,680
but I think like once you have found

00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:01,960
something that you want to want to

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:04,300
achieve or do and then you somehow

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,980
connect that with you know computer

00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,940
science is really just the thing for you

00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,319
to get there

00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,720
then I think you don't just makes it

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,420
much easier for you to just it becomes

00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:15,480
natural for you to crack all those hard

00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:17,859
problems and learn these things you know

00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,119
and it doesn't like at that point it

00:42:17,859 --> 00:42:21,369
really doesn't matter if it's like

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,369
you're doing it in school or doing it

00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:26,290
only a job I think the most important

00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:28,390
thing is you have the enough mental

00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:33,220
power to motivation to drive yourself

00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:34,780
through that process so I mean one thing

00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,970
that I think is that I mean it's also

00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:38,410
really important and understand at least

00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:40,210
in my experience that software

00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:42,400
engineering and computer science are two

00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,750
very different things and I'm not really

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,650
convinced you can learn software today

00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:48,970
in school I think you just build systems

00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:50,710
people are still trying to figure out

00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:52,030
how to build systems well I don't think

00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,650
it's something that's well understood I

00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:56,170
think there are some general principles

00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:57,900
um but we're constantly revisiting those

00:42:56,170 --> 00:43:00,160
so that's that's a whole separate thing

00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,560
but I think that computer science is

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,660
super important I didn't I didn't have a

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:07,240
CS degree and so I definitely had to

00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:08,710
learn it on the job and you know yeah

00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,829
okay 12 years later okay no if you think

00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,450
that's right but that took me a long

00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:15,400
long time and I certainly think that

00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:17,859
you're at an advantage if you're doing

00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,810
this in school I also will say that like

00:43:17,859 --> 00:43:21,310
yeah okay it turns out that actually

00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:22,960
there's quite a few sort of creative

00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,390
oriented people in this room that got

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,980
into computers but you know the CTO of

00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:29,619
my company Ricky I mean he has a

00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:32,920
master's in CS and I think having that

00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:34,990
sort of that sort of you know training

00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:37,569
and sort of educational background has

00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:39,069
greatly informed his ability to design

00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:41,650
his programming languages and his

00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:43,960
databases and I know just from when I

00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,760
when I travel into conferences a lot of

00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,470
my favorite speakers I mean I love

00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,420
creative stuff I'm a musician it's like

00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,910
like I love seeing crazy people on stage

00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,650
but some of the most inspiring people to

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:57,369
me what I see go to conferences are

00:43:53,650 --> 00:43:59,079
people with extremely deep sort of

00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:04,240
theoretical knowledge and their domain

00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:06,940
in CS so yeah just a little bit to that

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,710
I do have a CS degree but I come to see

00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,109
us anymore

00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,030
this is developer Idol sales but it

00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:15,640
helps me to you know I think that all

00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:18,190
the stem stem fields are great to have

00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:20,380
clarity of mind and to understand

00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:23,170
structure and to know that you know this

00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:24,670
goes before this and it just gives you a

00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:27,520
little bit of a structure of how to

00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:30,160
think and in the world a bit better than

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,180
if you only have a business degree as I

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:36,849
feel I think we have ten minutes until

00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,960
the end of the panel so let's get

00:44:36,849 --> 00:44:39,430
cracking through a couple of the

00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:42,730
questions I think we have time for two

00:44:39,430 --> 00:45:01,410
or three where we're good yes I will be

00:44:42,730 --> 00:45:11,619
running hi guys presentation

00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:13,450
presentation shy runs okay so it's more

00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:16,240
about stage fright so how to how to how

00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:20,650
to manage the first couple of comp

00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,940
conferences or the first talks I haven't

00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,940
given a presentation for nine years

00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:29,410
except for the one yesterday I hadn't

00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:32,230
done a launched a large-scale

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,820
presentation um so I you know I had a

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,580
kid another kid and it was very busy I

00:45:33,820 --> 00:45:38,050
couldn't do them but what I did was run

00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,940
our users group for a long time so I

00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:42,430
started and ran the Los Angeles Java

00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:43,599
users group in 1996 and I ran it for

00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,390
eight years so I was very comfortable

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,339
speaking to small groups and that

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,530
translates reasonably well so if you've

00:45:48,339 --> 00:45:53,380
done your talk preparation if you're

00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:56,099
interested in getting a talk talk to

00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,210
your local users groups try it there

00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:00,070
give it you know travel around a little

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:02,740
bit the great thing about Europe

00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:04,990
not so much Brazil but the great thing

00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:06,670
about giving talks in Europe is you know

00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:08,260
you've got a lot of municipalities and

00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:10,750
localities that are quite diverse within

00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:12,430
a short travel range so you could give a

00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,750
lot of talks and a lot of users groups

00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:15,640
about any subject that you're interested

00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:17,920
in the users I can know from running one

00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,810
that they're always happy to have a

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:20,390
speaker who's like enthusiastic and

00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,349
respond

00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:29,630
and will show up on time so that's a

00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:35,539
really good way to practice let's go

00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:39,559
here with David I do a lot of speaking

00:46:35,539 --> 00:46:41,450
but I I still get stressed out when I do

00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:43,160
my talks and so like for me it's just I

00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,630
had to rehearse a lot like I just

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:46,849
rehearse a lot whenever I'm about to

00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:48,559
talk it's like I'm in my hotel room like

00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:53,930
practicing the talk for like six hours

00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:55,400
so yeah so I'm still stressed out his

00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:58,160
attack I don't I don't for me it hasn't

00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,529
changed but yeah just I I would say like

00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,390
how I started was I'm talking to very

00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:03,499
small groups like maybe maybe there's

00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,329
only five people in the audience and

00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:05,930
you're still gonna get scared it's good

00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:07,789
practice

00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:10,549
like like give your presentation your

00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:11,720
friends get five five your friends

00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:13,249
together like hey have you checked out

00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,569
graph QL you know anything about it so

00:47:13,249 --> 00:47:16,400
let me just do a presentation about

00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:17,720
graph killer some other open source

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,190
thing that you're excited about oh

00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:20,440
that's that's definitely how I got

00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:25,180
started

00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:28,579
yeah so for me I think I started doing

00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,680
speaking at conferences like last year I

00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:35,210
mean I've been doing quite a feel since

00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,430
then but for me I I'm not sure if I

00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:39,289
started like speaking talking to small

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,450
meetup groups first or at cumference

00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:45,230
AFER's to be honest like I don't wait

00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:46,880
too much but but I've done both big ones

00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:48,950
and small ones and the small ones are

00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,970
definitely more a more intimate setting

00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:55,489
which like you're less pressured and

00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:57,859
more like friendly environment to get

00:47:55,489 --> 00:47:59,569
you started so if you you have like this

00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:01,369
big pressure for talking to a big

00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:03,529
audience you should definitely start

00:48:01,369 --> 00:48:05,420
with a smaller group first and sometimes

00:48:03,529 --> 00:48:07,220
when I prepare my talks it's like

00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:10,039
there's this technique on like rubber

00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,749
duck programming right so so you talk to

00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:14,269
a rubber duck about what you're thinking

00:48:11,749 --> 00:48:17,089
and I'm like thinking about my talk I

00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:19,400
just like I look at my slides I'm talk

00:48:17,089 --> 00:48:22,099
to a rubber duck like explaining right

00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,930
like we're doing this and this so so

00:48:22,099 --> 00:48:26,960
like so once you've gone through that

00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:29,809
process like it helps you like identify

00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,120
the holes and problems in your current

00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:34,460
talk preparation and it kind

00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:36,050
helps you refine that and I think you

00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,530
know the same technique applies to to

00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:41,060
like preparing talks and for me that the

00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:42,770
biggest like the most stressful part is

00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,550
really just the preparation stage where

00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:48,500
I'm like trying to you know get to a

00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:51,380
slice where I feel like it's coherent

00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:54,260
not like making really abrupt like three

00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,870
directions on topics and stuff and but

00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:59,690
really like once you stand on the stage

00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:01,970
I like it the thing is it's like you're

00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,310
in autopilot mode right most of the time

00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:06,170
you're just like it's like when you

00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:13,190
stand on the stage there's no turning

00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:14,930
back here it's doing no matter what you

00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:19,060
can't just say I'm sorry guys I'm not

00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:21,350
doing this talk now but it's going to be

00:49:19,060 --> 00:49:23,930
it's gonna be stressful definitely for

00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:26,090
the first time but like after the first

00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:26,750
one I just started to feel like more and

00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:29,600
more used to it

00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,820
and it becomes more so the actual

00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:34,250
speaking becomes the easier parts and

00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:36,200
the hard part is making sure come up

00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:40,760
with like meaningful content in a

00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:45,380
coherent fashion that's too short answer

00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:49,120
so we have I think this the content part

00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:51,650
is super import the autopilot

00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:53,840
let me kind of just qualify it by saying

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:56,270
you can only go on autopilot if you

00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,430
practice like lots lots lots lots so

00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,000
like practice and like you know memorize

00:49:58,430 --> 00:50:01,430
the point

00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,680
I always memorize my lines and not word

00:50:01,430 --> 00:50:05,840
for a word but I actually sue the thing

00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,480
that actually helped me the most in my

00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:10,640
public speaking is actually writing down

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,050
the script so like I used to only just

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,090
do bullet points of what I want to say

00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:16,090
and then I realize and then I always say

00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:18,200
like a lot of um and I have pauses and

00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:20,630
and then when I started writing out a

00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,420
whole script of like exactly the wording

00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:25,430
what that I want and then I go I don't

00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,530
memorize it word-for-word

00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:28,610
but then I can still fall back to it if

00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:29,960
there's something that's particularly

00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:32,270
like an idea that's particularly

00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:35,060
difficult for me to express on the spot

00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:36,950
I have the script I can fall back on to

00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:39,140
like be able to just autopilot through

00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:40,550
it that I've already memorized so that's

00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:43,040
the thing that's helped me the most and

00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:44,859
then the second thing is that I agree

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,739
completely the content

00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:49,150
content is king so the content is

00:50:47,739 --> 00:50:52,210
definitely the most important I found

00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:53,710
that it's it's always I think the most

00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:55,420
successful ones I've done that are the

00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:58,989
ones that have a good story arc like

00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,460
I've liked and usually I talk about some

00:50:58,989 --> 00:51:02,440
sort of journey I've gone through it so

00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:04,239
it's easy for me to have a story arc and

00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:06,039
then to have a story arc and then I wish

00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:07,779
I and like make them I tried to make the

00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:09,819
audience laugh a little bit sometimes

00:51:07,779 --> 00:51:10,930
doing it and then I try to make it so

00:51:09,819 --> 00:51:12,700
that there's at least something that

00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:15,910
they can hopefully take away so those

00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,470
are the things so my first international

00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,849
words that take presentation was in the

00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:20,589
Netherlands and I did the whole bullet

00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:22,720
point thing and the guy I was working

00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:24,640
with forced me to replace every page

00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,039
with bullet points with a picture and

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,450
then I quickly learned that

00:51:26,039 --> 00:51:30,910
presentations are short stories it's a

00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:33,160
series of stories so you don't read the

00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:35,140
slides you don't I don't prepare my

00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,789
script I just tell the story around each

00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,410
one and let people get where they want

00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:40,329
from the screen and let them hear what I

00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,579
want from the story but you have to

00:51:40,329 --> 00:51:44,230
bring your personality to it right you

00:51:42,579 --> 00:51:46,450
have to you have to force yourself to

00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:48,519
have fun and people see in here

00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:52,509
enthusiasm they enjoy your sessions a

00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:55,450
lot more just two comments on that since

00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:57,130
we know where I'm slow like and we come

00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,049
from a post Soviet bloc I would call it

00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,749
of the Eastern European parts we are

00:51:59,049 --> 00:52:05,380
traditionally very bad at presenting

00:52:01,749 --> 00:52:07,390
like awful like very very bad because

00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:10,029
the first time he actually presents is

00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:11,890
when you end your high school that's the

00:52:10,029 --> 00:52:13,660
first time essentially you get a real

00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,940
presentation that you need to give

00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:17,559
compared to the Western Europe where you

00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:20,710
have a little bit more of stage time

00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:22,089
during your studies so there are some

00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,099
associations it can help you with that

00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:26,259
you know like the debate association or

00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:27,640
or again physicists tournaments or

00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:29,650
whatever whatnot you know like places

00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:33,339
where you can debate and play in and

00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:36,640
discuss on a friendly level and get get

00:52:33,339 --> 00:52:39,039
accustomed to talking on stage to help

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:41,920
me a lot in the past and one comment is

00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:46,119
that if you're if you're not if you're

00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,289
not nervous you're not making enough an

00:52:46,119 --> 00:52:51,670
effort for that convey the the talk

00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:53,170
because if you're never nervous that

00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:54,230
means that you okay you if you really

00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,730
mean that do you

00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:57,950
be there you really want to give to talk

00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:00,140
otherwise you know it's just let her

00:52:57,950 --> 00:53:01,910
talk I we have time for one more

00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:06,560
question so let's make it count

00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:12,140
yes just a short that's okay we'll give

00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:16,250
you short answers once her words job

00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:21,859
interview experience great question for

00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:23,090
a long answer I don't think it was for a

00:53:21,859 --> 00:53:25,250
name with the tech stuff I did was

00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:27,080
probably like at a coffee for like a

00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:33,109
coffee shop job or something like more

00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:35,720
than 15 years ago I honestly didn't have

00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:39,440
any like super bad interview experience

00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:41,900
but like probably most because I just

00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,730
turned on the the thing if I like

00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:48,950
realize if there's some bad science

00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:50,780
going on or it's also because I I'm like

00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:54,770
I consider myself pretty lucky on my

00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:57,910
career path like I got my job then can

00:53:54,770 --> 00:54:00,260
go because they just approached me I

00:53:57,910 --> 00:54:02,750
didn't really go through interviews to

00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,670
to work at meteor mmm because they

00:54:02,750 --> 00:54:07,240
already know my work on view and I gave

00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:12,440
a presentation and they gave me a job

00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:14,800
and that was so but I did go through an

00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:19,160
interview at Facebook and I got rejected

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:21,410
that was that was when I just was out of

00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:24,800
school and and back then honestly like

00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:27,290
my JavaScript skills sucked and I fell

00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:29,090
to do like just explain what prototype

00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:32,119
on the earth and says and I was like

00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:34,280
dude I just totally blew it but it

00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:35,900
wasn't a bad experience in the in the

00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,080
way that I was interviewed but it's more

00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:44,090
like I was just really not prepared for

00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:46,970
it so other time so later later on it's

00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:49,310
mostly like we got into something and

00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:52,040
people are just I can sort of feel the

00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:53,780
way the company treats how they treat

00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:55,460
the interview processing the very early

00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:57,109
stages and if I feel like it's not the

00:54:55,460 --> 00:55:01,100
type of camel to do I just like just

00:54:57,109 --> 00:55:03,170
reject it yeah I just short answers or

00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,859
very funny stories very short and sort

00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:06,839
of funny my very

00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:09,299
very first technical interview that

00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:12,329
senior year my very first one is really

00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:14,489
nervous and the interviewer asked me a

00:55:12,329 --> 00:55:16,140
question and algorithm question that had

00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:18,089
to do with the alphabet and I started

00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,160
out with so since it's alphabet and

00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:22,319
there's equal to 27 and I was like wait

00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,979
27 wait how many letters are in the

00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:28,069
alphabet

00:55:22,979 --> 00:55:30,359
25 26 27 26 and then I never heard back

00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:32,009
if you're sick reschedule the interview

00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:33,420
because I did one with the cold one time

00:55:32,009 --> 00:55:36,920
and it was the worst interview I ever

00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:39,690
had there I didn't get the job yeah I

00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:42,239
did a phone interview while I was

00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:44,910
driving for a major game studio in Los

00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,440
Angeles phone screen is originally

00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:48,989
Quebec is this guy even worth bringing

00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:51,269
in to talk to so the interviewer was

00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:52,440
asking me like 50 questions and I

00:55:51,269 --> 00:55:54,479
was working at DreamWorks Animation

00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:56,130
animation writing graphics offer at the

00:55:54,479 --> 00:55:57,900
time but these are like low-level bit

00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,309
shift questions and I always bring those

00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,979
things up in a Python interpreter and

00:55:59,309 --> 00:56:03,959
try them out and I completely crashed

00:56:01,979 --> 00:56:05,609
and burned in this phone screen it's

00:56:03,959 --> 00:56:07,259
like well if the entry-level interview

00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:10,829
crashed and burned Google hired me six

00:56:07,259 --> 00:56:12,869
months later so not every interview is

00:56:10,829 --> 00:56:15,239
indicative of your skill level or your

00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:16,559
career path it's just sometimes you're

00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:18,150
not the right person for the job and I

00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:21,329
was legitimately not the right person

00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:22,829
for that job great and I'm the supposed

00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:25,559
to note I would like to thank you all

00:56:22,829 --> 00:56:27,869

00:56:25,559 --> 00:56:29,130
and discussion called my story thank

very much for listening and hopefully

00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:33,690
you're gonna have a rest of the day
