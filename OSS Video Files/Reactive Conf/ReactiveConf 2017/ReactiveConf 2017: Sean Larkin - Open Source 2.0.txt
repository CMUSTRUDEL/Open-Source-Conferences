[Music]

00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,000
you

00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:20,340
alright let's grab a seat and then that

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,420
way if there are questions in time for

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,830
questions y'all can ask some yeah it's

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,690
so like if you have questions you want

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,320
to get them ready already and you have

00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,460
go feel free to join at the slide oh but

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,570
we'll do it afterwards

00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:40,920
and so this talk is not going to be

00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:42,360
extremely long and so because funding an

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,390
open source project is literally

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,480
different for every single one who here

00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,040
is an open source author like ok awesome

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,820
so there's a good amount of hands you

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:57,240
know that working an open source is not

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,530
you know tulips and roses and you know

00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,710
there's a lot of struggles behind it

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,080
people can get burnt out and so like I

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,600
just want to share our experiences in

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,330
kind of a timeline of how kind of things

00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,869
grew from the web pack that was released

00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:15,180
in 2012 to what we have today and kind

00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:17,729
of just tips and advice that you can

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,829
take with you and see if applying them

00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,770
really have a successful kind of impact

00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:24,630
on your project so yes web pack growth

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,759
funding and sustainability and you know

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,579
the title of the talk was like open

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,170
source 2.0 and so as you know like

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:33,090
typically with the new release you have

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,509
like a new identity a new branding and

00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,369
that's kind of how we feel you know feel

00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,380
we what we are doing with open source

00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,439
it's something that has not been seen

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,100
before since Linux or you know the old

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,889
style

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,909
and so of course if you weren't at the

00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:53,030
last talk I am Sean Larkin I'm a program

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,960
manager for Microsoft's web platform

00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,459
specifically edge dev tools

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,289
who here is a PC Windows user like yeah

00:01:58,459 --> 00:02:04,109
have you installed the fall creators

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:06,829
update and tried edge 16 yet go ahead

00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,990
and do so and see how fast and amazing

00:02:06,829 --> 00:02:12,600
we've made edge and over the time in the

00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:15,360
past six months but yes of course also

00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:17,280
maintainer and I like to say advocate

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,560
because each one of the maintainer x'

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,630
and you probably met some of them here

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,459
today have specific roles and

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:25,519
responsibilities but we all maintain and

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,750
we tend to the garden that is webpack

00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:29,570
and then you know I worked on the

00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,640
angular CLI court

00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:34,640
but also just like I said evangelist for

00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,060
open-source sustainability and so you

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,270
might know that we are part of open

00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:42,710
collective and open collective is a

00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:46,250
transparent way for you to be able to

00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:49,160
donate in fund our project it's more

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,170
about being an investment in a part of

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:53,600
the community to double down on what you

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,250
use and ensure that the return is really

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:59,090
great which is using webpack and the

00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,350
quality that we ship to you so if you ho

00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,540
I don't know if you have made it back

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:04,580
they turned him down because it was - it

00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:06,500
was full and the last talk but these are

00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,290
his slides so I want to give him credit

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,380
for it but just a brief history of

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:17,180
webpack let's see wait did I go too fast

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:20,510
they did pass slides okay so in 2012

00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:24,290
March Tobias starts developing web pack

00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:26,000
due to an abandoned PR he was like in

00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,380
the github issue he basically says like

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,900
I think we should had code splitting two

00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:34,730
modules web make and the author says no

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:36,830
and then so to be as forked it and then

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,410
called it modules web pack for a second

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:43,519
and then renamed it to web pack and so

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:47,739
that was born then 2013 react hot loader

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,870
appears and we're not really sure like

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:52,100
exactly I think it's just kind of

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:55,820
starting to perpetuate in the react

00:03:52,100 --> 00:04:00,739
community and then in 2014

00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:04,519
pete hunt talks about web pack at OSCON

00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:07,730
west who here has seen that talk like

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:10,549
that was I had just gotten a flavor of

00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:12,920
web pack even watching this talk and

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,260
like this was like oh my gosh we want to

00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,940
try it out so thank you so much Pete if

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,700
you ever see this or you watch it it is

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,479
thanks to you in Instagram for a lot of

00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:27,410
our success and then July in 2016 so

00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:29,810
I'll talk about my experience I worked

00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:33,650
for a very small contracting company

00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,720
that did b2b data and so the culture was

00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,060
not a really great culture there and I

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,750
was planning to leave but one thing that

00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,940
I loved

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:45,020
is that was a reaction shot I always

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:46,820
came from the angular community and I

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,750
had never even heard of webpack I never

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,490
knew what it was

00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:53,390
gulp grunt you know those are the things

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:55,550
that I was typically accustomed to and I

00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,470
got my first taste of webpack working

00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,010
there and I was like oh my gosh what is

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,100
this

00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:02,420
it was a just I even get chills in my

00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,580
arms just talking about it because it

00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,200
was such a incredible experience when it

00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:09,680
was set up for the first time and using

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:11,930
it and I just wanted to know more and so

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,700
after I left this company I worked for

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,550
Mutual of Omaha which is an insurance

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:19,340
company and who here like works for an

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,960
insurance company anyone ok so what you

00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,290
should know yeah there's a good reason

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,290
why

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,700
so like web development in the insurance

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,320
industry is really slow like you have

00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,790
compliance and legal and all sorts of

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,340
things that you have to make sure you do

00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,770
and so like my first three weeks there I

00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,500
had basically free time and so I devoted

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,500
it to how can we make webpack work with

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:45,050
angularjs and so like then I even found

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,000
out like there are tech conferences like

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:48,740
there are you can submit talks to tech

00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,740
conferences and like you can go for free

00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:54,020
and so I was like I'm gonna do this so I

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,520
took the work that I did getting angular

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,710
and webpack to work and I submitted as a

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,220
talk and they're like Shawn we want you

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,780
to come and speak on angular 2 in

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,110
webpack and I was like oh gosh that's a

00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:08,510
lot to learn and it was just around that

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:11,390
time that I met you home Epsilon who's

00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:13,460
one of our maintainer x' and i said hey

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,650
like what can i do you know how can I

00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:17,780
help and so like I kind of pulled them

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,550
all into a like a git er chat at one

00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,979
time I was like I want to get you guys

00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,140
paid I want to see you know I I believe

00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:26,390
in this product I love it

00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,160
it's just an incredible experience we

00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,229
should be able to support ourselves like

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,350
why should you just work on it for five

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:34,760
hours a week and so it was just about

00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,350
that time that I joined the team and

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,919
then we created what's called the web

00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:41,890
pack core team in a medium post probably

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,919
one of our most popular medium posts

00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:48,800
okay so 2016 October we joined open

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,870
collective and then 2017 in January web

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,720
pack two releases

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,729
so you can kind of see like wow there is

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,960
a who here remembers how long it took

00:06:55,729 --> 00:07:01,460
webpack to to get out of beta like yeah

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,169
but we were starting to do weekly

00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,909
stand-ups and talk about what we need to

00:07:03,169 --> 00:07:09,740
do to get this taken care of ship our

00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:12,169
documentation and so then we started

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,030
kind of evangelizing like hey we could

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:17,719
if we fund ourselves we could really

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:19,969
make this incredible and so we're able

00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:24,590
to reach about an estimated yearly

00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:27,560
target of $80,000 as a budget and also

00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:31,430
this gives you ho time to ship survive J

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:34,310
s and the webpack Edition if you haven't

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,639
gotten that book go get it

00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:39,229
not only is it excellent literature it's

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,240
great to have and really talks about the

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,690
higher level concepts and things that

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:48,889
you should know and then we ship wet

00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:50,900
pack 3 in 2017 so like it took us how

00:07:48,889 --> 00:07:53,300
long to get what back to out and then we

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,360
ship wet pack 3 so you can see a huge

00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,400
difference in what we were able to do

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,199
once we could start sustaining the time

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,240
working on this project and then in 2017

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,460
of August our annual budget became

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,349
roughly three hundred thousand dollars

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:16,550
for a yearly and this includes a mozilla

00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:18,110
grant a contract from trivago who thank

00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,669
you guy I know the people from Chicago

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,319
might still be here but thank you so

00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:24,159
much like give them a round of applause

00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,680
as they kind of blazed the trail for

00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:31,370
sustaining our project and so thank you

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,469
so much and so now we're sitting roughly

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,760
around you know about over a quarter of

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,099
a million dollars almost a half a

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,409
million dollars a year for our project

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:42,680
Tobias is now full-time working on web

00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,480
pack to sustain himself and the question

00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:48,070
you're like Shawn shut up how like how

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,529
how did you do it

00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:54,470
so I think yeah who remembers reading

00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,329
this article anybody like this was

00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:59,630
really special because this was where we

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:01,640
talked we announced the core team and

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,800
there was a quote in our this is what

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,350
we're still using getter and I can't

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,900
remember

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:09,450
said but it was like hey we should start

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,340
doing like weekly hangouts or something

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:13,560
and then Tobias goes wow this is kind of

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:18,180
getting real and like that was the that

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:20,130
was the preface for this title so so

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:23,850
it's about changing the culture the

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:25,440
identity for us you know we were just a

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:27,690
project that was being worked on for

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,660
five hours a week with you know

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:32,340
scattered contributors that you know and

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,710
that's that's not really sustainable for

00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,510
product companies don't look to that as

00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:40,860
being something like oh we can really

00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:42,270
double down on this investment but what

00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,130
does it mean to change a culture or

00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:47,580
change an identity for an open-source

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,680
project one thing that we did that we

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:52,320
found really successful was creating a

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,950
medium publication so whether or not

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,980
your your project is large or small

00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:01,890
create a medium page for it give users a

00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,260
place to have curated content that is

00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,480
quality one of the things that you

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,580
probably will never see or maybe you do

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,710
but it's not very common is that like if

00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,300
you search webpack on Twitter you don't

00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:14,070
see thousands and thousands and

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,080
thousands of like retweet BOTS

00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,920
you know retweeting like a bunch of five

00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:22,770
cent articles instead we try and

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,560
aggregate and monopolize the quality

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:27,630
content to be on our medium page that

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,580
way we can ensure that there's one place

00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,980
that people should be going to to learn

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,960
about webpack or to learn everything

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,720
from our team our open source project

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:40,710
our organization so as you can see here

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,060
we have gotten so like the breadth or

00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:44,780
the amount of different content that we

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,800
have now has gone to not only Tobias who

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:49,410
primarily right now because these are

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,600
one full size full time author and

00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:54,510
developer is you know we have a

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,390
freelance log book so when we add more

00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:59,550
full-time contributors that we're going

00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:01,430
to pay we want them to be using the

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:03,840
freelance log book so people can see

00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:06,600
exactly what we're working on we have a

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,820
contributors guy which I author and even

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,040
though there's only two articles that's

00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,080
where like we want content and do not

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,930
only be focused but to also be anything

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,710
that anybody really wants to know to be

00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:20,560
here and so

00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,980
the second type is outreach so like who

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:26,170
here has okay just like think back who

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,240
you tweeted about webpack one time and

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:30,010
like some random dude from America

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,040
popped up and was like can I help

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,790
like who here remembers any of that

00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,950
outreach is super super super important

00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,890
and the story about is when I join the

00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,810
gore team I had only one commit I don't

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,760
even know if anybody uses that feature

00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,950
it's called auxilary comments and it's

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,720
inside output like that was my first

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:53,529
commit to webpack and so I was terrified

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,589
at first

00:11:53,529 --> 00:11:58,810
contributing is you know scary I mean I

00:11:56,589 --> 00:12:00,820
understand it and so I was like what can

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:02,920
I do like what am I good at how can I

00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:05,050
bring value to the project that is you

00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,970
know not already being done and so I was

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,620
like well I love helping people I used

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:10,960
to do technical support before I was a

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,310
programmer and so like literally I just

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:15,370
started going on Twitter and searching

00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,750
webpack constantly and now it's like I

00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,550
do this for five to six hours a day

00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:22,900
still

00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:25,450
and so like outreach is so important one

00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:27,070
as a maintainer by reaching out to your

00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,010
users it shows you that you can

00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:32,470
empathize with them empathy is one of is

00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:36,010
who here understands the term empathy

00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,570
like empathy is putting yourself in

00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:40,210
somebody else's shoes and understanding

00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,070
the struggles and the roadblocks and the

00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:44,500
experiences that they have to go through

00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,140
whether it's in life in development in

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,660
the project or trying to contribute for

00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,270
the first time and so empathy and

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,720
outreach are so so so so important I

00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,670
can't express it enough to be able to to

00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,930
really you know change your identity to

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:02,380
change the culture and show people that

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:04,209
you give a about them and how they

00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:05,709
use your project

00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,360
so yes outreach and like this was a

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:08,860
really fun tweet that I did one time

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,380
which is like what's in your bundle and

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,630
so basically you have people do webpack

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,459
bundle analyzer reply with this image

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,750
and essentially we just triage for

00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:18,760
you're like okay there's some

00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,740
opportunities here in here you should do

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,810
some code splitting like this bundles

00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:25,150
too big or you're using lodash in 14

00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:27,310
different places like you know all sorts

00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:30,939
of stuff

00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,769
um and then user governance so who here

00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:35,769
has voted on our webpack vote page

00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:37,269
before yeah okay so if you don't know

00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:39,790
about it every single one of you can

00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:44,740
impact the direction of our project you

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:46,779
go to webpack j/s org /a vote and I

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,430
think it was broken at the time cuz open

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,990
collective switch there api's but we got

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,579
that fixed didn't we we have their fixed

00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,240
us awesome

00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:57,639
so uh please go on there all you need is

00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,939
a github and every day is a github user

00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:02,740
you get one vote every day if you are a

00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:04,449
sponsor or back or you get golden

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:07,720
influence which is a hundred times more

00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:09,730
strong or a hundred times stronger and

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,589
so what what does this mean like

00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,199
literally what we work on the direction

00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:17,319
of this project literally is in your

00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:19,870
hands so not only is what we do

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:22,749
transparent the way that the money that

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,949
is funded is transparent but also the

00:14:22,749 --> 00:14:27,009
direction of the community is

00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:29,709
transparent and so we call this

00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:32,019
governance you decide our direction do

00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:34,779
you want to add you know a specific type

00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:38,319
of feature then every day go vote for it

00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:39,939
you know so take a look at this page it

00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:45,160
really kind of decides everything that

00:14:39,939 --> 00:14:47,920
we do yeah so transparency literally

00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,259
like I said transparency is kind of it's

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,089
one of these kind of underlying things

00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:55,720
that we try to continue to do as a

00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:58,089
project so this is just an example of

00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,589
the freelancing log book and probably

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,529
one of the most exciting things that

00:14:59,589 --> 00:15:04,269
we've done that's new and I think like

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,279
Tobias has also become really good at

00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,930
writing as well like I remember like the

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:09,430
first post we had to edit a few things

00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:13,389
and now he's doing really good job and

00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:14,529
so this is exciting and it kind of if

00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:16,059
you haven't taken a look at this go

00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:20,250
ahead it's on our medium publication

00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:22,779
medium.com slash web pack and so like

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:25,660
this kind of shows exactly what we've

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:27,519
gone through every single week or if we

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:29,829
have to skip a post and there's not much

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:36,090
exciting will group it into two weeks

00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:41,500
whatever and then love and love

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:43,420
so I can't like I can't put really a

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,650
good explanation around this besides

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,560
just love you know one of the most

00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:52,600
powerful things that you can do is just

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,960
show people that you care as a

00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,210
maintainer it's not even like it's

00:15:55,960 --> 00:16:00,100
powerful just as a user or a contributor

00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:03,540
just somebody if you want to following

00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:05,800
like this was all I did for three months

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,650
was look for these are the kind of

00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:10,060
tweets that we used to get initially you

00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:12,490
know because we understood that there

00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,350
are problems and all we want to do is

00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:15,940
show you that we care and that we really

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:22,630
love our users and we want you guys to

00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:26,890
have a good experience and love and like

00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:29,110
I can't stress this enough like going

00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:31,300
like Twitter who here who has Twitter

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:34,390
y'all have Twitter probably maybe sort

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:37,360
of ish if you don't and your maintain or

00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:39,790
go get one right now either brand it for

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,620
your project or branded as yourself like

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,990
you're some people may ask me like Sean

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,300
why don't you have an official webpack

00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:48,160
Twitter because people don't get who you

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,200
are or whatever and I'm like no because

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,230
it takes the humanity out of the fact

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,700
that we care I mean like if it's just a

00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,530
web packet count and then it just kind

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,150
of is like Oh somebody's just you know

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,250
whatever you don't know the person

00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:04,120
behind it you don't have anybody human

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:06,220
to talk to and so yeah like literally

00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,069
love it's the one thing that I cannot

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:11,350
stress enough to people is that no

00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:14,920
matter how angry or how mean or how

00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:18,550
crude that the best weapon against

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,110
trolls the best weapon against people

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:22,000
who are upset is to just show them that

00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:26,400
you care and it's just like hey is there

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:32,740
any way we can help always reach out

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:34,030
love I cannot say it enough and most the

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,770
time like literally you'll see here oh

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,170
I'm sorry I'm just venting and that's

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:40,450
okay encourage it like I literally tell

00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:43,420
people we want candid feedback because

00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:46,929
it raises the bar for our project and so

00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:49,000
it's these kind of things it's it really

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:51,429
is if you want to

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,630
project this is going to help you I

00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:54,940
can't say it's going to make it

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:57,700
successful because it's more than just

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,140
this this is just one piece but I think

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,090
this is one of the pieces that is

00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,549
missing from our ecosystem with many

00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:08,470
projects and why we've been able to be

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:13,240
so successful so remember no matter how

00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:15,190
angry you may be or how triggered you

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,340
might be as maintainer like you don't

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,900
get it or like that's terrible you

00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,309
shouldn't use that anyways like I would

00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,530
never say that to somebody just say like

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:26,799
hey you know we could probably show you

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:31,210
needs our way to do it can we help

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:34,000
and so like love some of the things that

00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,220
like ice tried to do so it's not just

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,010
Twitter though who here kind of knows

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:43,539
that like if your post ends up on Hacker

00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:45,789
News or reddit you're like oh god and we

00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:48,190
used to be kind of scared about this but

00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,590
typically what I do is I'll literally

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,240
just be the first one to respond on it

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,120
and just say thank you guys so much for

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,710
sharing this you know we love you know

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,049
the reddit community we love your

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,020
feedback we cannot you know we can't

00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:03,909
wait to show you what we're doing next

00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,740
thank you for the feedback and like

00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:07,750
nowadays if you look at most of our

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,900
posts you don't even have people that

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:15,100
are on us and so like to me

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,260
it's like it goes a really long way like

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,360
if we can make it in Reddit and hacker

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:23,350
news like we're doing the right things

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,830
so love and love same thing

00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:28,780
like I said in reddit JavaScript to post

00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,700
your posts your articles get yourself

00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:33,429
out there but then also comment on them

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,230
be like thank you guys I know that

00:19:33,429 --> 00:19:41,470
you've always you know criticizes and we

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:42,820
love that so help shape the future so

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,770
this is a slide that I always put on

00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,049
every single one of my talks and

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,809
speaking is kind of part of it who here

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:51,760
is terrified of speaking like let's be

00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:52,090
honest it's okay Tobias is raising his

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,600
hand

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:59,320
yes he's terrified of it and that's okay

00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,000
if you are find somebody who who loves

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,380
working on your project but also loves

00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,140
helping people

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,290
elevate their opportunities to to be up

00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:10,240
on stage and to talk about this stuff

00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:13,360
and there's nothing wrong about talking

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,980
about your project as an investment I

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,140
also think of it as you're like a

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,540
stockholder you own a share of our

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:22,930
project and you get dividends which is

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:28,480
better user experiences better support

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:31,740
or whatever and this is kind of like the

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,400
last slide but it's kind of important so

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,450
one of the things I always talk about is

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,970
maintaining an open-source project is

00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:42,010
really and and building an ecosystem

00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:44,650
building funding building contributors

00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:47,380
anything is always about the humans

00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,480
behind it first it's always the human

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,700
aspect and so I say always look to

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,400
create a partnership first if you're

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,560
over here listening to me talk with the

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,440
gentleman from IBM the first thing I say

00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:01,180
to them is if there's any way that we

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,220
can help you guys meet any of your

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,710
business needs or challenges let us know

00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,300
you can always reach us in DM we would

00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,250
love to do a brown-bag we would love to

00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:11,200
talk get yourself involved in

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,290
understanding who the people are behind

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,900
your ecosystem by seeing how people use

00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:19,630
your product you then can empathize with

00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,830
them and then you can understand oh well

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:22,330
maybe we should be doing something

00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:25,000
completely different or we should be

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,740
solving these kind of features that not

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,110
only creates trust but it creates

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:31,570
relationships and the relationships are

00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:34,120
what yield things like sponsorships and

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:36,340
funding for your project and then

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,800
there's sometimes a play is needed so

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:40,720
like when I say plays you have to be

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,510
kind of strategic or be aware of your

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,950
ecosystem so that could be anything like

00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:46,390
if you see a really great article

00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:48,220
somewhere and it's not on your

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,840
publication you should probably reach

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,710
out to that person and say hey can we

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:56,760
have this in our publication or it's if

00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:58,570
a certain browser like Mozilla is

00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:01,120
championing webassembly

00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,720
and it's a huge pillar for them as an

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,510
investment

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:08,110
maybe you should submit a grant to their

00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,880
open source support foundation to have

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:13,180
webassembly in your product and support

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,260
it so it's like you have to really think

00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,970
about how you're going to stretch

00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:18,070
strategize long term

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,690
and I don't really consider that a play

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:23,500
we believe that webassembly is the

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,629
future but by doing this grant we've

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:29,769
been able to extend our life just by

00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:31,600
this specific feature for a year so it's

00:22:29,769 --> 00:22:33,610
just one of the many ways that you can

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,899
think about like funding isn't going to

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,149
be you know something that just

00:22:34,899 --> 00:22:40,149
magically happens and you have to work

00:22:37,149 --> 00:22:44,110
your ass off for it one of the things

00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:46,570
that I think are crazy is that you know

00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,610
I've never felt so distanced from the

00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:51,100
project in terms of like my code

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:53,620
contributions I remember back in trying

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,779
to land webpack to like I think I did

00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,139
like you know land like 10,000 lines of

00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:01,960
changes to webpack but and I know the

00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:03,580
system through and through but I have

00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,830
felt so distance because I've been

00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,620
working on this and I've been working on

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,779
this and they are super super super

00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:14,559
important to the project and we consider

00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:16,750
them contributions so even if you don't

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,879
or you're afraid of the code but you

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:21,309
know how to sell or you know how to

00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:23,590
interact with people that is your role

00:23:21,309 --> 00:23:26,409
in a project find a project that you

00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:29,200
love and believe in and using these kind

00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:32,169
of tools the love the partnerships the

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,620
human side of it then the blessings that

00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:37,559
come our funding our support our you

00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,669
know different kinds of things that help

00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:42,940
continue build the infrastructure for

00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:45,789
your organization so that's all I have

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,110
for you guys but we'll do Q&A but thank

00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:52,820
you

00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:55,379
[Applause]

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,899
okay so yeah we have probably a pretty

00:23:55,379 --> 00:24:00,809
solid amount of time for oh I actually

00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:03,450
did did a good job with time okay so six

00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:06,389
minutes is but brah here today so you

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:08,789
have epsilon is BA brah on Twitter he's

00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:11,039
on our core team he's here today but I

00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:12,389
did he was going to be at the last talk

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,549
but he couldn't because it was full

00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:18,570
which is a good and bad thing I wish she

00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:20,249
was here and then hope Hannes please

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:21,869
tell us about web pack and trim how does

00:24:20,249 --> 00:24:24,690
it relate to the web pack project yes

00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:26,279
that's excellent question so this is

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,600
kind of a play but it was also something

00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,149
that we thought it was a great idea so

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,580
all of our loaders and plugins used to

00:24:30,149 --> 00:24:36,269
be a part of the web pack core project

00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:38,940
or organization on github now what we

00:24:36,269 --> 00:24:42,359
decided so we wanted to be able to have

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,639
as many open slots for Travis you know

00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:48,029
for free like Travis for testing and CI

00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:52,320
and all of these repos inside of our

00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:53,639
core org were taking up space and so we

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,259
decide to move it out to a separate

00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:58,499
organization called web pack and trip

00:24:55,259 --> 00:25:01,320
and now what was awesome is that we were

00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:03,239
able to basically collect not only all

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:05,909
of our core loaders and plugins but then

00:25:03,239 --> 00:25:07,379
people from the community and what

00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:09,239
excites me about is that we have a set

00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:11,340
of standards and so it's like you have

00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:13,999
to structure the code a certain way so

00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:16,769
it makes using a plug-in a loader less

00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:19,019
unpredictable for you but then it's also

00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,749
more predictable as a contributor so

00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:25,799
your Twitter handle is the Lark in is

00:25:21,749 --> 00:25:27,239
your happiness no but I could like I'll

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,679
put a sign up on my house when I get

00:25:27,239 --> 00:25:30,809
back and we'll call it the lark in I

00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:31,769
just thought it was a play on words and

00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:33,090
like I know that there is a

00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:37,440
bed-and-breakfast out there that is

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:39,330
really pissed like probably but yes guys

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,159
I think that's mostly all the time that

00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,710
we have of course you can find me

00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:47,909
whenever I know it's not an exact

00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,259
science for contributing but the goal is

00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:50,909
to really think about the people and the

00:25:49,259 --> 00:25:53,900
partnerships and how you can connect to

00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:55,960
them so thank you very much

00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,960
you

00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,520
