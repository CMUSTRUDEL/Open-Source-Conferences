𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞
Mind the perf

𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
Adding more and more new features almost always comes at a cost. Let’s look at some ways how to keep heavy frontend in react performant even when the codebase is growing like crazy.

#devtalk

𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞
Push your state to the edge

𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
React revolutionized the way most of us think about the state. No more binding, no more mess, just a beautiful unidirectional flow of data. It was great.

Until your app grew.

How the heck do you scale a central store of all app state? Where do you drill all the props? Why does every update go through a bazillion nested layers before it shows?

React Hooks enable a new architecture.

An architecture where state lives where you need it, business logic is where you use it, and anyone can understand your code without studying the whole codebase.
