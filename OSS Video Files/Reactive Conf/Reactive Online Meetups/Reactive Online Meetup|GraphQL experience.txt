TALK
Graph Databases beyond GraphQL

TALK ABSTRACT
Many great projects were created and succeeded with the help of GraphQL. Let's connect another node to our community's knowledge graph with a deeper understanding of native graph databases as an example of Neo4j.

In this talk, we will discuss a different view on data architecture, contrast it with relational databases, and provide analogies with GraphQL. Along the way, I'll share my experience of using graph databases on production with highly connected data projects.

TALK
Offline-first made easy with GraphQL and Amplify DataStore

TALK ABSTRACT
During this talk, we will focus on offline-first applications, what challenges they try to solve, and how easy it is to build one with Amplify DataStore. Amplify DataStore is an on-device persistent repository for interacting with local data and able to automatically synchronize via GraphQL
