	𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞:
These microservices are made for testing, and testing is what we’ll do…

𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧:
…one of these days these tests are gonna help a lot for you!
But to do that, you need to write those tests. Which is what we’ll do: write tests for microservices, and understand the best strategy for testing them, the techniques used, and the correct mix of unit, integration, and end to end tests.

𝗚𝗜𝗟’𝘀 𝗕𝗜𝗢:
From the olden days of DOS, to the contemporary world of Software Testing, Gil was, is, and always will be, a software developer. He has in the past co-founded WebCollage, survived the bubble collapse of 2000, and worked on various big cloudy projects at Wix.
His current passion is figuring out how to test software, a passion which he has turned into his main job as Evangelist and Senior Architect at Applitools. He has religiously tested all his software, from the early days as a junior software developer to the current days at Applitools, where he develops tests for software that tests software, which is almost one meta layer too many for him.
