Forbidden Planet Cured my Imposter Syndrome


𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
Come with me on an adventure with a heroic robot, a mad scientist, a feminist, a pilot, and our monster, imposter syndrome. Let me share how a sci-fi movie from 1956, starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen, taught me how to recognize imposter syndrome not as the monster hellbent on ruining my romance with an ever-evolving development ecosystem, but as a tool to prevent burnout.

Jen Luker is a Sr. Frontend Engineer, conference speaker, and BookBytes podcast co-host. She has spent the majority of her career as a full-stack developer using PHP, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular fondness for frontend technologies. She is an advocate for both accessibility, and processes that make doing the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard. When she's not exploring solutions, learning new technologies, or reading, Jen's spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting; she's even been known to 3D print her own tools for the job. She is also fascinated by all things space, antique cars, and IoT.

Building Your Own Design System with CSS Variables

𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
You probably don’t need a CSS framework. While CSS Frameworks are wonderful and certainly have their place in the development landscape, they are often overused in place of a custom solution. In this talk, we’ll look at how you can abandon the bloat and overhead of a CSS framework and quickly build a robust design system of components tuned to your needs using CSS variables.

I'd like to thank you for joining us

00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,740
today and staying ahead of the curve

00:00:09,549 --> 00:00:14,780
this is the third reactive online Meetup

00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,970
and they're very excited to have you

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,310
my name is jungle of the ash and I am

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:22,850
the country manager of blacken labs and

00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:25,609
agree and if you may wonder what welcome

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:29,330
labs is vacuum labs is actually the

00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:32,840
company where many in the years ago back

00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:36,710
in 2015 a reactive conference was born

00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:40,640
and they had been sporting a reactive

00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:43,730
conference ever since vac nerdz is

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,610
actually a company that provides us for

00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:49,100
developers were very useful tech

00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:54,039
blockchain and online marketplace

00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:58,960
projects such as vidcom which is a

00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:02,030
market risk for buying cheaper flight

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,660
because you could be could find cheaper

00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:09,080
faster if the global pandemic and didn't

00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:12,890
caught us off guard and caused travel

00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,470
restrictions and begin working with many

00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,810
other projects San Francisco to Japan

00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:21,350
including the Cardinal condition where

00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:23,810
we built a valid application or one of

00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:28,150
our most recent sighting project marks

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:31,580
in Hong Kong which is virtual banking

00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:33,350
but that's enough about us I'd like to

00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,170
actually tell you a little bit about

00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,740
cookies meet up we're gonna have two

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:42,560
amazing speakers one of them is stop

00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,979
Scott polisky and the other is Jen

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,640
looker but before I introduce them stage

00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:51,920
I'd like to share a few back is during

00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,100
the two dogs you will be able to ask

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,619
questions you can find on the bottom of

00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,610
Q&A sessions but we are waiting for

00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:06,110
questions to out the both of the talks

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:09,530
and we can have Q&A sessions after each

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:12,170
book I'm gonna read up the question you

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,700
will also have the chance to actually

00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:16,950
just raise your hand

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,190
giving the many sessions and ask your

00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,920
life actually I'd like to ask you to

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,260
maybe lose this chance you know being

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,450
very bullish about these online meetups

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:30,180
I think these offer a great opportunity

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,940
to host amazing speakers without

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,840
geographical boundaries connect

00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,170
partisans from all around but you can

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,230
always have us make this more attractive

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,500
by asking professions using extra

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:48,480
keyboard but the voice and it will help

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,849
us to create and mimic a similar

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,989
environment as we will be in a real meet

00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:56,579
up so thanks thanks in advance for

00:02:53,989 --> 00:02:59,970
staying interactive and engaging with

00:02:56,579 --> 00:03:01,920
our speakers you can engage with the

00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,810
speakers and be their culminating a Jew

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,599
in the meetup but actually after the

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:09,840
meetup you can if you are not part of

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:12,630
the reactive stack community then you

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,959
can certainly join and after the meetup

00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:18,090
you will actually had a chance to chat

00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,760
with our speakers a little bit maybe ask

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:26,100
questions for which we won't have big

00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:28,970
time so we don't have further ado I'd

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:35,220

00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,620
for this event during these turbulent

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:12,419
times so we wouldn't appreciate you have

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:16,440
you coming on so first I'd like to give

00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:19,349
the word team Chan who is going to talk

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,069
about what she learned from a sci-fi

00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:27,289
movie about Emperor syndrome so without

00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:27,289
further ado period up for Jack

00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,980
you

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,039
Jen I think your immunity

00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,029
you

00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,029
you

00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:54,290
how's this is this better what there

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:58,740
okay good

00:05:54,290 --> 00:06:01,980
so how forbidden edit a movie from 1956

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,610
the first Hollywood blockbuster sci-fi

00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,490
movie

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,770
I took my imposter syndrome so as

00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:10,260
opposed to telling you the story of the

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,840
movie Forbidden Planet and then why it

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,720
affected me instead I'm going to tell

00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,220
you my story through these slides so it

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,600
should be a little bit fun and there's a

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,700
lot of them so we're gonna kind of

00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,890
really look like so this would be to

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,360
begin with has Leslie Nielsen and this

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,350
is probably the only time you'd be the

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:32,250
serious role I mean it's it's an

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:35,190
adventure we mixed have Robbie robot to

00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,920
get another vintage sci-fi movies but

00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:40,680
today starring as Bob

00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,200
and our trip starts with our good ship

00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,060
NPM and it success to this planet far

00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,520
away altair-4

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,910
where tech that threatens the projects

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,390
there you know there's engineering

00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:56,430
architect that has been sent and the

00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,040
problem is is that when they sense the

00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:00,540
group people they just lost contact and

00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,650
now there's only one programmer left so

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:05,540
now they're going to check on this

00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:08,760
program to see what happened our

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,700
characters today are angular react

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,130
member and PHP because these are the

00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,650
languages that I started with and began

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:21,270
my journey as far as JavaScript

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:24,660
programming once they show up they find

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,030
dr. PHP and dr. PHP doesn't want to

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:30,120
leave this planet he's happy here

00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:31,740
except because they traveled so far to

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,850
get here they refuse to leave until they

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,630
have a conversation

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:39,300
so dr. PHP invites the men now there's a

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:43,140
bit of a surprise a dr. PHP actually has

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,970
a daughter they didn't expect this when

00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:51,750
she's never seen a JavaScript framework

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:55,950
before to give you an idea this is me in

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:57,390
this movie I'm playing her and yet she's

00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:59,100
never actually seen JavaScript and she

00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,890
thinks this is great and the JavaScript

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,570
frameworks look at her and they're

00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:10,290
pretty excited to have a new programmer

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:14,310
and we're going to actually start with

00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:17,970
my introduction with number I went from

00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:19,350
again the pew background into trying

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:21,120
ember trying to see what the big

00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,880
frameworks were about because people

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,100
were starting to talk about them and I

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,960
was having a lot of trouble I didn't

00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,330
quite understand the concept of this

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,780
structure and because I came from that

00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,840
PHP background my JavaScript history was

00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,180
mostly about minor interactive things so

00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,130
nothing to do with frameworks but at the

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,160
same time react was starting to show up

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,780
and it looked really interesting however

00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,240
you don't always want to jump on that

00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:49,620
brand-new bandwagon because you know the

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,750
thing with the bleeding edge is that

00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,610
you're the one that ends up leading so

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,110
you know sometimes you hold back and

00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:57,390
wait a little bit longer until something

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,830
says and shows that it's going to

00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:02,580
actually be around for a minute before

00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:05,760
you dig into it at the same time though

00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:07,800
in the friend community as a whole you

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,270
know baby babble and webpack really

00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,630
started to become a thing especially

00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:16,020
with Amber and angular and reacts coming

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:18,120
on scene and that meant there were a

00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:21,240
huge amount of JavaScript based

00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,210
libraries and features that were coming

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,920
on the scene as well and a lot of

00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:30,420
conferences that were trying to show off

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,970
all of these features so went back to re

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,470
ember and I decided to try a actual

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:38,310
program I was working on this project

00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:40,170
for a friend of mine and again and I

00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,780
kept hitting my head against this wall

00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:51,770
and I just didn't understand why it had

00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:51,770
to be this complex so I again let's

00:09:51,830 --> 00:10:01,860
react and realize that in from blast

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,770
about forums and the Fran or about me

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:08,700
and how I was I felt pushed into these

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:11,850
languages and then also how I didn't

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,850
necessarily know JavaScript yes I use

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,089
JavaScript everyday but I didn't know it

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,920
very well I knew just enough to get by

00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:23,940
but nothing about the deep intricacies

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:29,070
of how JavaScript work and so I decided

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:34,670
to really dig in and make it work and I

00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,670
tried to fight with various programs and

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,570
I tried to make a bathtub using nothing

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,010
but handwritten SVG's because I wanted

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:43,550
to learn how those worked and that was

00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:47,100
really hard and took forever so I

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:51,320
essentially started to have some

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:56,480
communication issues as far as how this

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,480
was working out and as the

00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,649
industry kept moving and the companies

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:02,940
that I was working with kept moving and

00:11:01,649 --> 00:11:06,200
the schemes that I was working with I

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:09,839
kept moving I kind of felt left behind

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,690
you know and I I was really afraid to

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,480
let people know that I was having a hard

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:17,850
time getting hold of JavaScript in these

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,360
various other languages and how it was

00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:25,320
difficult to feel like I was keeping up

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,880
when telling people that I didn't know

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,800
what was going on or that I was scared

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,440
or I was afraid wouldn't make me look

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,570
like I didn't know what I was doing and

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,180
that they should trust me

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,180
so it became really difficult

00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:47,240
and when stop talking people you start

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:48,260
having some pretty serious issues you

00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,060
know and this is where the first

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,060
portions of my personal impostor

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:55,670
syndrome stories really starts I started

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,730
working longer and later to try to make

00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:02,510
up for the fact I was coding slower I

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:05,530
was more irritable and frustrated with

00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:08,210
people that were talking about new

00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,550
technology because I felt out of the

00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,840
game and didn't necessarily know what

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,820
they were talking and put all the time

00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,890
and because of that I didn't want to let

00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,840
everybody know so I stopped asking for

00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:20,420
help which is like the absolute opposite

00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,590
opposite and you should be doing and

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,940
then I really started having nightmares

00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:28,310
and insomnia

00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:31,280
the more difficult work became the more

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:33,440
worried about it I was and I even

00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:35,840
started dreaming in code where I would

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,940
rerun a nightmare over and over and over

00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:43,790
again until it stopped being a nightmare

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:45,530
by going back and recoating the dream it

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:48,350
eventually reacts captured my heart it

00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:51,500
had this way of being close enough to

00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,270
vanilla JavaScript that I could start

00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,990
interacting with it and start using it

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:59,450
and it just became the language that my

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:03,530
company is jazz well so it became much

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:08,810
nicer now back in our story

00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:11,510
dr. PHP catches amber amber catches

00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:15,950
angular and react in his office

00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:18,980
and he takes them into this big giant

00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:20,090
machine to try to show them that the

00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,750
reason he doesn't want to leave is

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,750
because he's discovered this huge huge

00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:29,930
giant like 20 mile by 20 mile machine

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:32,210
that does this magical thing and when he

00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:36,460
tried this machine it gave him brain

00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:38,690
boost so when we're looking at this I

00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:40,520
feel like this really represents how we

00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,400
look at our community from the inside

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,370
you know we think that our heroes in the

00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,710
images that we're working on are way up

00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:52,209
high right and we think that we're way

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:54,129
down here we are

00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,860
afraid that our brains aren't big enough

00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:58,329
or fast enough or we're not smart enough

00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,119
or we don't have enough time to be able

00:13:58,329 --> 00:14:03,189
to do what they do you know but the

00:14:01,119 --> 00:14:06,999
reality is that we think that we should

00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:09,699
at least be up here right but this is

00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:10,959
where we really are if there's really

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:15,369
not much of a difference between where

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:18,309
they are and where we are and the reason

00:14:15,369 --> 00:14:19,869
for this is that our experience is in

00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:22,790
the way that we've learned and evolved

00:14:19,869 --> 00:14:25,040
through our code base

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,650
means that they have different expertise

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,050
than we do they've focused on different

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:31,880
technologies than we have so that when

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,510
our technologies bump in together our

00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:39,140
Venn diagrams overlap but we know things

00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:41,690
they don't and we forget we forget that

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,520
they only know a small amount of

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,500
information and they're just really good

00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,120
at that and we're really good at this

00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,120
other thing they barely understand

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,250
so like I said it's machine is huge and

00:14:54,640 --> 00:15:01,720
the creators of this complex and

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:04,590
powerful program are gone there's no

00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,590
sign where they went

00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:11,750
and this is when I started identifying a

00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:15,410
monster here so as I progressed through

00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:17,899
this issue of no longer talking to

00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:20,330
people being afraid that I was slipping

00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:22,520
that maybe I shouldn't programmer

00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,470
because I I'm not dropping this the way

00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,020
that I feel that I should be my

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,570
self-esteem is terrible and I isolated

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:32,240
myself I stopped talking to notice my

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:34,120
co-workers my boss and sometimes even my

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,790
family

00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,440
you know even the smallest headache or

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:41,290
sniffle would key home from work because

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,420
I just read it go anything and I would

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:46,000
force myself to bang my head against

00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:47,350
wall after wall after wall on a problem

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,380
that someone else probably could have

00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:52,660
helped me with in 15 minutes so began

00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,640
job hunting my job hunting I mean don't

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,589
not looking for another programming job

00:15:54,640 --> 00:16:00,160
I mean like maybe I should be a janitor

00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:03,140
or a florist something that I knew I

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,520
wasn't suited for

00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,730
you know I mean you start to get deep

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,460
enough into this spiral you need to

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,990
really pay attention and take care of

00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:18,240
your mental health because at this point

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:20,430
imposter syndrome isn't just impostor

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,600
syndrome it's starting to become

00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:24,120
something much deeper

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,820
whether it be anxiety or depression or

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,960
just a lot of stress then you need to

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,590
make sure that you're talking to people

00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,590
about that

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:37,310
you

00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:40,050
so in a last-ditch effort to me in tech

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:43,560
doc our friend angular takes the brain

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:47,459
boost and the brain was so intense the

00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:51,810
most people don't live so doc Kara's not

00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:54,000
gonna make but he did learn that in this

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:56,190
case the ancients left heck because of

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,790
the monsters from the edge now what's

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:02,430
the it'd we asked dr. PHP and he says

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:05,339
that the it'd is an outdated term for

00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,630
the subconscious so what angular was

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:08,990
saying is that there were monsters from

00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:11,089
the subconscious

00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:15,610
so if they're monsters from the

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,610
subconscious who is dr. PHP really

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:21,470
dr. pH feeds me just as much as his

00:17:19,639 --> 00:17:24,949
daughter is it's the two different sides

00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:26,000
of me it's my pride in dr. Petrie

00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,299
because that's the language that I

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,480
started with and I'm also her and that

00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:35,659
I'm curious about these new technologies

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:40,389
and these technologies are are rising up

00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:40,389
at this time and I need to learn them

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,929
so what's happening is that burnout is

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,370
coming to attack these monsters burnout

00:17:47,929 --> 00:17:52,940
attacked my ship and were knocked down

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:56,240
my communications away array burnout was

00:17:52,940 --> 00:18:00,770
a monster that was coming to hurt me

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,710
before and all this time it was the

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,160
imposter syndrome that was leading to

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,160
burnout

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:14,990
and in order to be able to avoid burnout

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,799
you have to understand that it's you

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,799
know it's our pride

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,970
yes to not house conversations don't

00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,970
need to have

00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:33,250
so hustler syndrome most specifically

00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,350
that feeling of I am not supposed to be

00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,970
here or that I don't understand or I'm

00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:38,920
afraid that I'm not as smart as everyone

00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:43,750
else or people are going to see me for

00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:47,500
the fraud that I am is an emotion just

00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:50,530
like any other emotion anger fear

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:55,260
frustration these motions are not bad

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:58,540
they're meant to fuel and incite change

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:00,910
they're supposed to be uncomfortable

00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:04,630
because they make us want to change

00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:07,300
something about it whether it's I am

00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:09,700
tired or I'm grumpy or I don't like this

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:14,830
person it's meant to change that

00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:16,660
situation and we as a community have

00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:18,490
decided that impostor syndrome is just

00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,520
something we feel always it's just a

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:25,720
thing and everyone's gonna have it and

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:28,740
just accept it but if we allow impostor

00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:31,020
syndrome to help us evolve and change

00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:36,010
then we're treating the emotion

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:39,250
correctly and we can avoid burnout so

00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,230
when I'm feeling those feelings of

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:45,060
impostor syndrome I ask myself why right

00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:50,580
now why is very moment I'm feeling this

00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:50,580
is it because someone is

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:56,500
King expertly about something is it

00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:57,850
because I'm in a room full of people

00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,550
talking about a subject that I don't

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,100
know very well is it just this code

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:05,830
probable thing right now and I know that

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,620
smell to being the solvent I'm on my

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:12,130
plate and I just feel dumb like why

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,260
right at this very moment and then what

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:17,560
would make me feel less like an imposter

00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,480
right now and let me add is that an

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,040
actionable answer or because my first

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,430
response to that question is well if

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:28,500
only I knew everything you know and

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:30,420
that's that's unreasonable

00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,830
so what would make you feel less like an

00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:35,610
imposter syndrome right now sometimes

00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:40,470
that answer is ask questions it's okay

00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:42,360
to not know find out or you're tired

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,700
you've spent too long hitting your head

00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:48,149
against this problem take a break take a

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,399
nap go for a walk

00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:53,919
or maybe you need a vacation or maybe

00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:56,979
you need a new job but you need to ask

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,830
yourself what is it that you think is

00:20:56,979 --> 00:21:01,840
going to make us better and what you can

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:02,739
do about it and if it's not something

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,460
that you can do right at this very

00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:08,139
moment schedule it put it on your

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:10,239
calendar make sure that that's something

00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:12,850
that you take care of because maybe it's

00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:14,409
you you need more training you can't get

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:18,179
more training in the moment but you can

00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:18,179
look up and schedule for training

00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:26,640
and if we ask ourselves questions we can

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:29,970
use burnout or we can use impostor

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,150
syndrome as the feeling to incite change

00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:35,880
to make us better at what we do not to

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:38,070
keep us back and hold them back and make

00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,210
us feel like we're not worthy of the

00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:41,210
positions that we have

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,250
so now next time you have impostor

00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,590
syndrome you have questions you can ask

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:55,310
yourself situations that will allow you

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,200
to really look at what's going on inside

00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,330
of you and outside of you and realize

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:03,670
that there's things you can do about

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,670
impostor syndrome to stop it

00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:11,219
and you can defeat it and when you

00:22:07,269 --> 00:22:11,219
defeat it you're avoiding that burnout

00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:15,350
the end

00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,200
you

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,380
you

00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:33,860
thank you so much thank you for the

00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:40,140
great talk so nice time for question I

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:45,780
only see one question in the chat the

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:47,970
dr. PHP survived this dr. PHP was our

00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,940
pride sometimes what we have to do is

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:53,640
sacrifice our pride and get over the

00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:55,740
fact that we're afraid that people might

00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:00,810
see us as less and just ask the question

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:04,440
or find out more about it I mean it's

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:07,440
okay to not know so did dr. PHP survive

00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:10,110
that depends on you that depends on

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,310
whether you can overcome your own fears

00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:19,560
to be able to get over your own imposter

00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:21,330
syndrome so I'm hoping that people took

00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,060
my advice and they gonna just raise

00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:27,270
hands you ask questions alive

00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:29,720
anybody feeling fancy joining in for a

00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:29,720
live question

00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:38,610
okay we have another question Chad do

00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:42,360
you find impostor syndrome ongoing thing

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:45,150
or does it ever go away imposter

00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,480
syndrome comes and goes so you'll feel

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:52,470
it you can identify why you're feeling

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,390
it take steps to mitigate that and then

00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,310
it goes away for a while and then it

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:59,220
will connect at some point because we're

00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:01,740
humans and just like you can't solve

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,700
anger and make it go away forever you're

00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,740
not going to be able to solve the

00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,290
posture syndrome and make it go away

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,690
forever but you can recognize it for

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:11,910
what it is an emotion to incite change

00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:15,300
and start looking at what changes you

00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:18,660
need to make right now to make it go

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:20,070
away and to make you better and more

00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:22,100
comfortable in the situation that you're

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:22,100
in

00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:27,770
thank you and more questions

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:39,080
I have a question how can a manager

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:42,620
identify developer have imposed impostor

00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:46,100
syndrome and how can one support him or

00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:49,580
her one of the things that was really

00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:51,110
helpful when I was going through one of

00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,670
the deepest versions of imposter

00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:56,210
syndrome that I had which was the first

00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:58,250
one was that my main measure noticed

00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:00,440
that I'd stopped talking to everyone but

00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:04,580
I started separating myself from the

00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,900
group and started to pull me in for

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,820
extra one-on-ones and having those

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,350
conversations like are you okay is there

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:10,910
anything that you're frustrated with are

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,290
you concerned like I've noticed that

00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:14,870
you've been pulling back you know what's

00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:17,390
going on do you need more training are

00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:19,280
you struggling with something and really

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,770
starting to ask those probing questions

00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,330
to identify why that person is pulling

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,340
back what those problems are and

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:28,070
sometimes you find out that the issue is

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,110
something at home or the issue is just

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:34,060
like with a co-worker and then you can

00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:37,460
start working on those issues but just

00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:40,040
watch when someone starts pulling away

00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:41,300
and when someone starts getting

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,450
frustrated every time a new technology

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:48,080
starts being brought up like the signs

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:49,760
are subtle but you can see them and once

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,520
you do you can start solving those

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,070
problems and sometimes as a manager that

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,960
role is for you to encourage them to

00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:58,850
take time with their family or to take

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,310
time off or go home for the rest of the

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:04,040
day you hit your coding limit go take a

00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:06,830
break or why don't you go for a walk or

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,170
is that story too hard can we transition

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,610
it out maybe maybe it's not too hard but

00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,170
you're just done with it and you need to

00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:17,060
just switch it out with someone else's

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:19,790
story so listen and watch for the signs

00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:25,130
and then you can start solving those

00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:28,090
problems with them thank you so much any

00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:28,090
more questions

00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:35,330
questions for now don't forget that you

00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:38,270
can use the stack community to contact

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:40,310
Jen later she's gonna hang around that

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:43,730
for a few minutes after the talk I

00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,620
believe thank you so much Jennifer for

00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,900
the wonderful talk I think he probably

00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:51,490
enjoyed it as you can see it in the chat

00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:53,470
session thank you so much for your time

00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:58,220
[Music]

my pleasure thank you so our next

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,580
speaker is Cal Poly's key who is going

00:27:01,910 --> 00:27:07,430
to talk about creating design system

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,720
with design systems with CSS very

00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:14,330
variables and how to see the overhead of

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,600
dealing with CSS frameworks reload the

00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:19,390
further do please Scott the stage is

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:25,400
yours

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:27,860
cool get my screen sharing going sorry

00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,490
I'm sure like most people everything is

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,610
crazy

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:33,860
my computer died a week ago

00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:35,870
luckily Apple took three days to fix it

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,330
somehow we got screaming kids and

00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:40,550
barking dogs over here so with that

00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:43,760
Professor you might hear some some

00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:48,180
babies crying or some dogs barking it's

00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,650
likely let me fire up the video here

00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:51,650
the one second

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:04,809
oh okay cool so make sure everyone can

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,490
see the is a everybody can see the video

00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:10,120
here I think we should be all good ready

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:13,390
to go so first and foremost I wanted to

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:17,380
thank the organizers of this reactive

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:18,610
meetup for inviting me to speak it's you

00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,350
know things are crazy right now and I

00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,929
really appreciate their flexibility

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:25,660
allowing me to make this work as

00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:27,370
possible and also I want to thank Jen

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,840
for her amazing talk is super relatable

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:34,120
I really loved how you integrated the

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,830
the the slides from the movie that was

00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,409
really super cold but either way that's

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:42,460
a topic that I think we all deal with so

00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:48,690
really really great so let's get into it

00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,690
here I am just going to get it started

00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:54,460
wanted to pop out the chat here zoom how

00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:59,290
do you pop out the chat you mean once

00:28:54,460 --> 00:29:02,260
sorry about this usually I'm pretty

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,060
solid with zoom here not getting a chat

00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:05,980
window whatever okay

00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:09,880
whatever so let's get started design

00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,550
systems in CSS variables and the sub of

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,960
this talk is to design two systems it

00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:16,110
dive into why we don't use CSS

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,960
frameworks now this is something that

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:23,200
I've been exploring for a little while

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,940
we needed to redo the entire theme on

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,470
level up tutorials and unfortunately we

00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,660
had to start from scratch

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,520
so it's not that we get to rewrite a lot

00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:36,190
of the ideas that we had approach

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,280
building our site with so before I get

00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:42,040
into it too much Who am I I am skotowski

00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:44,020
I am the co-host of the syntax podcast I

00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:46,660
get twice weekly podcast I do it with

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:47,860
the West boss and I'm also the creator

00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,240
of level up tutorials which is a

00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:56,860
tutorial streaming serve as a tube okay

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,780
and were there subscribers on YouTube

00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,640
but we've been doing over 2,000 free

00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:02,380
tutorials on YouTube and a ton of paid

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,100
premium tutorials on a level up

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,780
tutorials calm so this sort of mode of

00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,270
me talking into a microphone into a

00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,550
camera is sort of my default so if we're

00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:14,020
being entirely honest the online calm

00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:17,140
things pretty nice for me I'm pretty

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:21,310
useful so hopefully it'll be kind of

00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:23,170
relaxed and so here so prehistory love

00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,480
love love betrayal is calm it was

00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:27,310
originally yield on Drupal using the

00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,610
Omega theme and it was just sort of

00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:32,700
solid together with Omega and it was

00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:37,690
eventually imported to me per Jas

00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:40,120
sometime I believed 2014 20 yeah 2014 it

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:41,260
was ported to meteor and with meteor it

00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,990
was an officially built on their

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,530
front-end framework called blaze and

00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:50,080
then it was then rebuilt into react

00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,390
where right now it resides in this for a

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,430
long time and there's also two super

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,440
sites there was a stored up little

00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:58,750
tutorials and liveable tutorials come

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,820
and both of those sites

00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,110
existed as entirely separate identities

00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,290
and they were invented to come by

00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:08,200
into one so as you can see this is a

00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:10,090
pretty standard life cycle of many

00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,429
projects right it changes and changes

00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,870
and changes and changes and changes next

00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:16,000
thing you know you have piles of

00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:19,450
functionality added on top of piles of

00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,230
functionality and like you would come to

00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:26,380
expect the CSS was a total mess it was

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:29,350
absolute garbage and I really pride

00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:32,950
myself in writing excellent CSS that's

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:38,020
like really the way I like to program is

00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:41,679
via CSS however over time it's

00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:45,970
inevitable what project under goes that

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,130
much of a change that the initial system

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,990
it was built on is going to be just

00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,370
totally left in the dust I'm sure many

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:56,320
people have experienced something like

00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:57,910
that so we did what any smart team would

00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,010
do wouldn't we rebuilt it from scratch

00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:02,320
19 pretty loosely it's me and one other

00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,309
developer so we had a lot of freedom

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,190
don't we get to make all the virtual

00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:08,190
choices it was prior to this built on

00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:15,070
stylus was the CSS preprocessor also

00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:17,890
with post to CSS and now we wanted to be

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:19,990
spelled components so we had to think

00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:22,510
about what we wanted it to do and really

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:25,360
a lot of these things just kept pointing

00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:27,309
to the answer of CSS variables because

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,490
our audience did not need to support the

00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:33,309
IE 11 which is of course the main bummer

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:36,490
with CSS variables is they don't work on

00:32:33,309 --> 00:32:38,770
ie 11 that said if a the majority of

00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:40,990
your users aren't using 11 and I mean

00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:43,540
like want to say the majority I mean

00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:46,450
100% of our users are not using ie 11

00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,250
our audience is web developers right so

00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:51,010
he had total freedom to use CSS

00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:53,350
variables so I got to learn a whole lot

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:57,130
of lessons so give you some introduction

00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:59,590
on CSS variables overall and the screw

00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:02,350
past right is we're probably used to if

00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:04,630
you used a CSS preprocessor in the past

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:07,780
I don't know years or so you've probably

00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:11,470
seen one of these two syntaxes or maybe

00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:14,020
less syntax so the assassin text was

00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:15,929
dollar dollar sign your variable : the

00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,520
bell lu stylus

00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:18,929
actually really like stylus because it

00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,190
had this transparent variable whole

00:33:18,929 --> 00:33:22,200
thing where you could override a

00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:24,779
variable so that way you could define

00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,929
the keyword black on your site to just

00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:30,000
be black right it's just uh it's the new

00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:32,610
value anytime you use the keyword black

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,730
it just would output your color I love

00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:40,529
this this one my favorite features and

00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:42,870
then sometime along CSS variables were

00:33:40,529 --> 00:33:45,299
announced as being an actual thing and

00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:47,880
we got a peek of the syntax and what do

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,980
we get we get this and I think most

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,330
people they saw this initially and I say

00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,730
most people I'm speaking for a lot of

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,929
other people that I don't intend to you

00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,890
may very well look at this and be like

00:33:54,929 --> 00:33:57,840
that's great

00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:59,450
but I lived through this and I thought

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,130
well what happened to all my my

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:04,049
transparent variables from stylists my

00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:06,120
nice variables from sass I'm gonna miss

00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:08,429
that stuff I don't want to use these CSS

00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,950
variables what is this and I initially

00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:13,080
didn't like it and I'll talk a little

00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:14,550
bit of why I changed my mind really

00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:16,050
quickly after I started using them but

00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:18,960
initially I really just thought this was

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,399
too verbose and didn't really I don't

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,030
know it wasn't as clean and easy to read

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:26,609
but I soon came around so this is the

00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:30,540
the syntax you have to define the scope

00:34:26,609 --> 00:34:32,849
of the variable itself in this case the

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,260
: root scope just defines it as the root

00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:37,080
of your application and then the

00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:39,089
variable name and then the value then

00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:40,950
you can use the variable but you have to

00:34:39,089 --> 00:34:45,570
use this var function and then you

00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:49,320
preface this with these two hyphens so

00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:51,919
here's some uh here's some code pens for

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,659
you see this in action now here's where

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,909
CSS variables really start to take a

00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:59,190
turn into being the cool cool feature

00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:01,080
that I knew and loved them today as we

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,170
have our root scope defined as black we

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:06,450
have our h1 used as black you could see

00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,420
this normal in here and then the spicy

00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:11,520
version is getting a class of spicy but

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,040
notice how I'm not changing the color

00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:16,230
property here I'm changing the CSS

00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,050
variable and what this is doing is

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:22,200
overriding the variable within the scope

00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:25,589
of this class and this becomes a key

00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,349
property to what makes CSS variables so

00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,430
excellent so this isn't obviously a very

00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,930
basic version

00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:32,400
and obviously you would probably never

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,380
do it just like this because why

00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,809
wouldn't you just change the color but

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,180
check it out this gets really cool here

00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:40,800
really quickly so here we have the route

00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,250
to find just black once again

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,619
we have the H 1 here as black and we

00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:49,020
have the C div but you'll notice this is

00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:53,160
pink well why is pink well if we scroll

00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:57,809
down you'll see here I'm updating the

00:35:53,160 --> 00:36:00,210
variable within the body scope to be the

00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:04,859
black to be now magenta which means that

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:07,380
you can update CSS variables within a

00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:09,480
media query which is just one of the

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:11,130
most amazing properties of them and

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,770
check this out when I adjust the media

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,410
gray it changes just any good media

00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:18,900
query does but it's actually updating

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,990
the variable meaning that you can change

00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,450
a host of prog is on your site with one

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,490
fell swoop just by changing in one value

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:28,380
rather than having to update a thousand

00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,900
different classes and this gets really

00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:33,720
super interesting the more and more

00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:38,660
involved you get in this so the key

00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:41,690
point here is that these CSS variables

00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:44,490
unlike our pre-processed variables are

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,829
reactive they're fully reactive to

00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:48,809
real-time in our application without us

00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:51,930
having to do anything changing classes

00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:55,530
or whatever so let's add a little

00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:59,309
JavaScript here as you know the web is

00:36:55,530 --> 00:37:03,119
one to do and we have our background of

00:36:59,309 --> 00:37:05,940
barbg we have the color of barbg

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,819
actually I don't know what happened here

00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,829
this should be below this doesn't matter

00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:15,630
anyways it still works space that's done

00:37:10,829 --> 00:37:19,079
here there we go so the route is defined

00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:23,549
as the BG text or the BG is white the

00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:26,250
text is 333 and therefore the body back

00:37:23,549 --> 00:37:30,540
or the background is white and the color

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:32,849
is text now we with one simple question

00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,490
and this is classes being headed to the

00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:37,980
body I shouldn't say this is the body

00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:40,680
all we're doing is updating the BG and

00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,260
the text so if I click the toggle theme

00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:45,660
just by simply editing a class

00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,090
we've now created a dark mode Hey voila

00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,370
that was the easiest dark mode ever now

00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:54,060
granted this is a pretty trike example

00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:56,130
specifically because you're just

00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,070
changing two properties here but you can

00:37:56,130 --> 00:38:01,560
imagine if your entire application used

00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,260
a series of these properties whether is

00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,120
BGE text or whatever then when you

00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,490
toggle the dark mode just by changing

00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:11,250
two values you could get a dark mode of

00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:15,410
working for the entire application and

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:19,440
just about no time and now I'm gonna do

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:21,000
no this is necessarily a live demo here

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,400
it won't move some of the stuff over

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:30,570
here okay so I'm calling this the live

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:34,970
demo but it's let's see puppet and over

00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:39,540
this is the actual level up tutorials

00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:43,350
dot-com here this is the actual site

00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,690
that's life right now pop open to make

00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:48,570
it fullscreen there we go okay so this

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:51,870
is the actual site so this is exactly

00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:53,970
how our designing system works and this

00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:59,100
is how our dark mode works so if I head

00:38:53,970 --> 00:39:00,930
to my account and I just update the

00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:03,420
account here you'll see that we have

00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:05,550
this dark and a whole site it becomes a

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,780
themed now our whole site gets themed

00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:11,520
based on that several key variables

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,860
if you can hear dog barking right now my

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:16,650
dog is going nutso apologize there I

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,650
don't know she usually gets upset when

00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,180
packages around me so okay so we have

00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:23,100
our light theme and this is the standard

00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:25,410
theme for level up tutorials let me look

00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:28,020
at the actual CSS in the site you can

00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:30,870
see here's a whole bunch of our CSS

00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:32,760
variables defined just like this here's

00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:35,990
the where they're all defined and we

00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:40,500
start to get into it where we can say

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:43,890
the background color is purple the line

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:47,370
color is white 60 even more importantly

00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:49,440
the sheet background is white in the

00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:51,120
site we use sheets sort of like material

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,880
design so the thing is a sheet of paper

00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:56,370
so that's a sheet of white paper so it's

00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,960
initially white we the sheet hover color

00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:04,050
a sheet of QWERTY it's a whole inch

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,450
which is great and we also have the card

00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,640
background for our cards so what this

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,990
means and what things like border radius

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,630
and whatever we'll get into the system

00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:15,030
more in a second but what it means here

00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:17,580
is that we have these simple properties

00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:20,910
set based on colors and that means we

00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:25,170
get to change the entire theme of the

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:27,480
entire site with just this many lines of

00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:29,550
code this is our entire dark mode for

00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,350
the entirety of level up tutorials this

00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,720
is it right here and it's just by

00:40:31,350 --> 00:40:34,920
changing several variables rather than

00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,720
having to deal with classes and

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,760
individual things whatever we're just

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,890
changing live variables and all we're

00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,540
doing again is adding a class to the

00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:45,390
body and that's overwriting the root

00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,760
scope and you can see it really makes it

00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:49,950
easy to add a whole ton of different

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,740
themes and we have the olan mode we have

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:55,800
the 90s theme and we have the next level

00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:59,700
and and the waverace 64 I also have a

00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,980
wave race 64 Suns that theme but it's

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,960
it's not quite there yet it's got a nice

00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,420
little sunset it's one of my favorite

00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,270
parts so we have this this whole naming

00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,990
system set up and this is just easy

00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:14,730
changing one class and the only Java

00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,830
Script that we're doing here is adding

00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,090
and removing a class we're not having to

00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:20,190
do JavaScript

00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:22,590
other than having a removing a class and

00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:25,620
it's updating entire sites though here's

00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:27,270
the 90s theme where all of the colors

00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:31,950
have to be color name so we got Rebecca

00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:34,320
purple and the teal and black the next

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:36,660
level is basically the same as OLED but

00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,460
things are gray no purple so for people

00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,110
who don't like purple and then the

00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,210
waiver 64

00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:47,310
these colors are all taken directly off

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:48,990
of the wave race 64 box art so this is

00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:50,280
my favorite theme I usually leave it on

00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:51,840
this but

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,700
sometimes it's nice to leave it on the

00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,050
default because that's how majority of

00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,920
your users are using the application

00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,870
okay so let's get back into it when

00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,350
we'll talk a little bit more about level

00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:05,820
up tutorials code in a little bit so

00:42:04,350 --> 00:42:09,060
let's talk about the system here the

00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,620
system of the system the system so how

00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:13,080
does the system work how to design

00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:18,120
systems work well really the whole point

00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:20,190
of a system is to let let the code do

00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,560
all the work for you and not have to

00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:26,010
make decisions I should be able to drop

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,780
a card English sheet and a paragraph and

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,430
a header in that and it's gonna look

00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:31,980
good every single time because the

00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,530
system just exists right the cool part

00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,180
about doing your entire system in a CSS

00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:38,490
variables is that it makes it really

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:43,560
easy to tweak change update on the fly

00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:45,330
as you've seen we all know as developers

00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:47,250
I should say design is hard I'm sure

00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:49,710
even as designers designers hard design

00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,780
is a difficult skill one that most

00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:55,200
people take their entire careers to

00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:56,010
learn and master I am NOT a designer I'm

00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,830
not a designer

00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:01,110
I did however design this whole site so

00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:03,690
whether or not I am a designer or not I

00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:06,840
have to professionally wear of that hat

00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:08,580
as a designer and for the most part it's

00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:12,480
a hobby that it's something that I've

00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:14,400
had to learn and pick up as I go so as a

00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:19,770
developer

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,270
idea to think inside of a system so what

00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:24,180
does the system do what is the system

00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:26,250
native because it's really easy if

00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:28,770
you're a logical programming mind

00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,510
thinker to think right I'm gonna build

00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:33,119
the system and the system just takes

00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:38,630
care of it all so your system contains

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:41,640
colors type-2 as in typography spacing

00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:44,460
characters and what I mean by character

00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:46,260
in characters is sort of like the things

00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,970
that make your application your sight

00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,039
your design unique the things that make

00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,079
your application feel different than

00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:53,400
others the way that my border-radius is

00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,039
compared to yours the way that my

00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,900
spacing and colors and fonts are and the

00:43:56,039 --> 00:43:59,849
elevation which is really just the

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,589
system that we use I took the word

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:03,359
elevation for material design we didn't

00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:04,020
take a ton for material but I did take a

00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,940
couple things

00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,710
elevation being one of them as in the

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:09,900
idea of something being away from the

00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:11,660
canvas should have shadows that react

00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:14,130
the way like a light source would and

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:16,650
there's also the idea of elements here

00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:18,480
now elements are a little bit

00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,220
interesting to think of elements it's

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,579
almost like HTML elements these are like

00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:26,279
core pieces of chunks structural chunks

00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:29,010
like a card that don't exist in HTML and

00:44:26,279 --> 00:44:31,890
they should have some defined predefined

00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:35,339
Styles so first and foremost let's

00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:40,970
define colors too often people I think

00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:44,099
jump right into defining your colors

00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:48,000
intentions or actions right they'd say

00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:49,319
here's our ears our accent color here's

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,750
our this color here's our that color

00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,190
what I like to do is take all of the the

00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:54,750
main colors that are going to be used

00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:57,240
throughout the site but also just colors

00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:59,549
in general such as pink green and blues

00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,069
those kind of things and I would find

00:44:59,549 --> 00:45:04,440
them within our systems colors now our

00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:07,260
colors were created for us by a designer

00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,069
in 2012 way back in the day Mike

00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,329
McMillan super talented designer but I

00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:15,299
pick Lee I'm not good at picking out a

00:45:12,329 --> 00:45:18,539
color scheme I would often go to a like

00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:21,000
a color hues or cooler or when our site

00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:22,950
is to grab a predefined a color scheme

00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,720
so I'm not inventing these color schemes

00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,640
and I don't know if I recommend you do

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,180
that either unless of course you have an

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,030
eye for color it's thing

00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,560
takes quite a bit of training right so

00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,530
you're gonna define your colors first

00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,900
and foremost and then we're gonna define

00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:40,270
the colors intentions the reason why we

00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:42,550
don't just say the BG color is white is

00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,280
because well white outside of our

00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:47,200
application is ffff but inside of our

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,630
application it may be 1 1 1 1 and that

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,400
might be white so I always define the

00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:53,710
colors first and foremost and then take

00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,870
those colors and then repipe them in to

00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:58,420
the intentions ie like what they're used

00:45:55,870 --> 00:46:00,250
for this way if I wanted to change all

00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,990
of the way that the purple looks on the

00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,820
site I just changed the purple value

00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:05,650
however if I wanted to change the

00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,480
background color to gray I can do that

00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:09,480
without adjusting any other purple value

00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:18,340
so next is typography right typography

00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:20,680
is hard notice how all this stuff is

00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,990
hard colors hard types hard designs hard

00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:25,060
it's all hard right but for this I use a

00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:29,940
lot of these tools now the one I like

00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:33,970
the most is types calm now type scale

00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:37,390
looks like this and it allows you just

00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:39,160
looked at a ratio and a font and a base

00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:42,280
font size I think our base font size

00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:44,620
under the top is 18 and it spits you out

00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,930
this check it out it you can even grab

00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:50,050
the CSS directly from here which we did

00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:53,080
in fact our CSS will look ugly familiar

00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:54,790
to this CSS right here the cool thing

00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:56,500
about this is that it lets us know you

00:46:54,790 --> 00:47:00,880
have your whole heading system set up

00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:03,370
and it gives you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,280
headings we don't have 19 headings

00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:08,050
typically in HTML and if you need more

00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:10,270
than 9 headings would you you might

00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:12,130
maybe say you want a huge one you click

00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,160
the plus button or you click the plus

00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:18,700
button down here and you can even more

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:24,790
now our type system we have let's scroll

00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:28,030
up our type system has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:29,770
it has 9 different headings now the

00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,750
reason why is because I wanted to have 9

00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:34,150
different font sizes on the site for

00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:38,440
headings but we defined them all as

00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:41,110
headings rather than h1 h2 h3 because

00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,710
sometimes is something semantically has

00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:44,260
the

00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:47,369
ideas and feelings of nh-1 as it needs

00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:51,070
to be the biggest text on the screen

00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:53,080
semantically structurally for all sorts

00:47:51,070 --> 00:47:55,869
of accessibility reasons but also just

00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:59,200
SEO reasons for a lot of reasons you

00:47:55,869 --> 00:48:01,599
want to write semantic HTML right but

00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:03,119
that always doesn't correlate one-to-one

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,470
with the font size and it's nice to

00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,839
instead of having to reach into your

00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:09,790
pocket of em's Rams or whatever to say

00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:12,700
oh yeah this thing that's the heading

00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:15,190
one or that's the the extra big-ass

00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:17,800
heading so these are our different

00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:19,330
heading sizes and this is largely how I

00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,550
do it you also notice here the heading

00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:23,619
front and body font is as well but that

00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:25,690
way we can instead of referencing a font

00:48:23,619 --> 00:48:27,540
title the front something you just the

00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:33,480
the body font the header front whatever

00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:37,680
so that's our system buh buh

00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,680
try not to lose my slides here

00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:46,100
ridingo Oh where'd those let's go it's

00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:48,900
alright I lost them no worries

00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:52,290
they are a browser window so that's cool

00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:55,920
okay let's see if I do come in and death

00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:58,110
is that to fall spitting out whatever so

00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,280
here we have typography now all of these

00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:00,960
little links are good these are all

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,490
things I highly recommend out circum and

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,500
checking out vertical rhythm and

00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,840
overcome rhythm is a idea in which

00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,570
you're defining the space above and

00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,370
below your your your headings your

00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:16,350
paragraphs fonts to make sure that is

00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:17,970
all equivalent to your line height so I

00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:19,740
did it turns out I didn't even need to

00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:21,480
show you my my stuff but here's that

00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:23,730
again in case you want to see now for

00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:25,560
some minor exceptions here I didn't show

00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:28,110
you this in our actual code but the base

00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,450
font size is set here as being one REM

00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:32,160
the base nav size is set to this the

00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,810
small font size is set to this in the

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:36,330
smallest font size now whenever those

00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:38,370
are used we keep our heading to use the

00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:41,370
variables instead I don't like to have

00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:43,590
the same value declared twice as a value

00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:45,390
here but again every every system is

00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:49,850
different that's the that's one takeaway

00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:49,850
here okay

00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:58,269
so margins margins are tough right we a

00:49:55,690 --> 00:50:00,910
lot of people use margins and especially

00:49:58,269 --> 00:50:06,970
when they're first getting into CSS the

00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:08,650
mers say this well use margins all the

00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,210
time myself but if you don't know about

00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:12,099
collapsing margins and some of the

00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:14,740
pitfalls that they have well you could

00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:16,660
end up in a situation that looks

00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:19,509
something like this now we all have this

00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:22,089
we've all seen this and this makes me

00:50:19,509 --> 00:50:25,200
sad is what this says here's what makes

00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:27,640
me sad about this the body itself

00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,660
actually let's see if I can pop this

00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:33,700
open into its own window

00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:36,849
nobody can inspect it do it live do it

00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,559
live okay so this body this is the

00:50:36,849 --> 00:50:40,450
padding on the body but notice how

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,789
there's so much more space above the top

00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:45,220
here there's so much more space that's

00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:47,380
weird right well why is that you notice

00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,410
there's even a divot container here well

00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:52,299
if you aren't used to how collapsing

00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:54,549
margins and margins work in general in

00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,739
CSS this may be one of the things that

00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:59,230
you dislike about CSS if we look at this

00:50:56,739 --> 00:51:01,480
h1 you can see that this space is being

00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:03,759
created by the margin of the h1 and

00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:06,519
likewise the margin of the paragraph tag

00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:07,029
extends beyond the container like what's

00:51:06,519 --> 00:51:09,759
up with that

00:51:07,029 --> 00:51:13,180
why does that exist right now obviously

00:51:09,759 --> 00:51:14,920
there are fixes for this actually this

00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:17,319
overflow:hidden fix this yes it does

00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,940
overflow:hidden fixes this but you want

00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:22,150
to throw over all hidden on everything I

00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:24,970
don't so a good way to solve this issue

00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:28,509
is instead of dealing with margin tops

00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:31,989
margin bottoms is to then think about

00:51:28,509 --> 00:51:33,700
primarily as a padding value on the

00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:38,440
container itself right let's say we did

00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:43,690
a padding of one rim top and bottom now

00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:47,710
we get rid of our margin up and this

00:51:43,690 --> 00:51:51,069
just works so largely what we do is we

00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,170
use margin bottom only throughout this

00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:55,299
site now there are some caveats there's

00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:57,160
always going to be caveats but from the

00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:59,289
most part we tend to always rely on

00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:00,789
flowing downwards of things to never

00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:02,200
have any situations where things get

00:52:00,789 --> 00:52:03,410
bumped up where you're not expecting

00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:07,170
them

00:52:03,410 --> 00:52:10,760
so that's one of the reasons why we we

00:52:07,170 --> 00:52:10,760
stick to margin margin bottom

00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:20,700
okay so styled components or by any

00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:21,990
other name okay and this is what I'm

00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,390
talking about way the elements now we

00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:26,280
use styled components in level of

00:52:24,390 --> 00:52:28,320
tutorials to define a card like this

00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:30,570
that way we can just use our card right

00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,910
this is our card in fact if we want to

00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:34,590
see the card component itself this is

00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,450
the card over here just get to the

00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:38,460
background of card BG the border radius

00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:40,440
of border radius the elevation of

00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,290
elevation get some padding position

00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:44,520
relative margin bottom and saying that

00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,320
everything in here should not have a

00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,690
margin top well the first child should

00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,360
never have a margin top this is the nice

00:52:48,690 --> 00:52:54,330
looks plis atlanta CSS so this is the

00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,160
carb right in that way we can use this

00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:57,960
card as a thing right this is an element

00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:59,460
but I highly recognized that not

00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,020
everybody uses style components that I

00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:04,140
would say by a longshot not everybody

00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:06,480
use the style component so what do we

00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:09,030
have here well we have been style

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,040
however I just used a class of card so

00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:12,450
you can use the system with anything

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,780
that you're using whether it is been

00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:19,200
block element modifiers I think that is

00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,640
or style components CSS nsj just

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,950
straight up classes anything what you're

00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:25,140
doing is defining the thing as it is as

00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:28,040
an element you can imagine it in HTML

00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:28,040
element

00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:33,720
you

00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,370
on the lung of the same lines what makes

00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,720
any of these elements good look what

00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:41,330
makes an element better than another

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:44,790
element and largely that it's simple

00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:47,630
it's obvious hard to break and

00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:50,070
extendable as then I could drop a card

00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:51,690
onto the page and it works I can drop a

00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:53,370
header I can drop a button I can drop

00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:56,040
anything into there and it just works a

00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:58,290
little bits of CSS like this margin top

00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:01,820
inside of a card everything inside of a

00:53:58,290 --> 00:54:04,740
carbon then the first child of a

00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:06,780
immediate child of a margin I'm sorry

00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:08,250
yeah the immediate held of a margin card

00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:10,080
isn't going to have a margin off the

00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,700
lines like this really Savior but in

00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,140
addition it can be extendable for

00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,840
instance we have these things called a

00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:19,050
line card and the line card I'm actually

00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:21,510
just doing some somewhat redundancy as

00:54:19,050 --> 00:54:23,340
it could have been extended so we could

00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:25,290
have taken this card and extended it now

00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,210
I guess it was just really different so

00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:28,620
we didn't do that but they should be

00:54:27,210 --> 00:54:32,640
able to be extended like you should be

00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:34,770
able to have a dark car pay a red card a

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:37,320
line card one that has no elevation a

00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:38,940
modal card all these things that should

00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,860
be living and breathing off of the same

00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:44,460
code that you can just take and extend

00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:46,470
ah to break I went over hard to brakes

00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:48,630
and you can't something in there that's

00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:50,900
quickly make it look bad and all of the

00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:56,660
stuff is obviously easier said than done

00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:59,250
but your practice you'll get there so

00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:02,130
part of it is using systems in

00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,360
simplicity over configuration and again

00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:06,560
I'm going to show you some demo code

00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:08,460
here systems and simplicity over

00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:12,030
configuration means largely if you're

00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:13,890
looking at our if you're looking at our

00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:16,740
these are some of our layout components

00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:19,320
a lot of times when people write like

00:55:16,740 --> 00:55:22,140
elements and components within CSS I

00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:24,090
referred to like like a class as a

00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,860
component here I'm using those words

00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:27,780
sort of change early what they do is

00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:29,670
they add a lot of options right a lot of

00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,560
modifiers if you're thinking in been

00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:35,550
right the block element modifiers right

00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:37,650
what is this thing well it's the this

00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:39,210
version and there's these hundreds of

00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:40,440
different class names you can apply to

00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:42,390
this every single time you have to

00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,250
memorize one of those class names or in

00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,640
a CSS and Jas

00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:49,860
like props or something anytime you

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,440
modify something with properties the

00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,750
more options you give in my opinion the

00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:57,270
worst of things becomes because we have

00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:59,580
just a bunch of standard elements that

00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,920
do one very specific thing for instance

00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:05,430
we have a layout which can either be a

00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:10,110
tight wide or just normal or a tight

00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:12,990
layout it's stuck to 940 pixels a wide

00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:15,690
layout will go up to 1280 otherwise it's

00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:17,820
always going to be 95% we do not offer

00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:19,550
any other modifications to the layout

00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:22,770
other than this

00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:24,570
likewise I mean if we did we would need

00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:26,430
to extend it into its own thing it's no

00:56:24,570 --> 00:56:28,320
longer the layout sometimes like I said

00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:31,260
people want to add so much configuration

00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:34,620
so we're adding simplicity here again

00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:38,160
this is all CSS in JSF but it's largely

00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:39,930
mostly CSS and I'm sorry if some of the

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,670
fact that this is CSS and j/s gets in

00:56:39,930 --> 00:56:43,020
the way of what it is you can think of

00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:45,090
this media large is just a straight-up

00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:46,560
media query any time you see a function

00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:48,870
like this could just be an additional

00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:50,730
class added to this so this is our

00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:53,760
columns component and it's just using

00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:56,310
display grid grid gap of 50 and a grid

00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,290
template columns that's changed based on

00:56:56,310 --> 00:57:01,260
a property value which can either be an

00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:02,670
array or a single value and it's always

00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,950
going to actually I'm sorry this is

00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:06,450
column so this is going to be always two

00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:09,480
columns it's just going to be whether or

00:57:06,450 --> 00:57:11,070
not this is reversed or normal so whole

00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,580
thing is either going to be one fraction

00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:17,370
65 or 65 one fraction likewise we have

00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:20,340
all of these components that are very

00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:22,050
basic considering our Flex component

00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:25,380
basically just adds a display of flex

00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:28,380
and martin zero margins and it just gets

00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:31,440
things to our system as well as our grid

00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,940
component which you can see here a good

00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,680
component is the one I was actually just

00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:37,560
starting to describe where you passing

00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:41,130
an array or a single string value and it

00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:44,610
spits out some grid stuff so these are

00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:49,110
just individual little layouts that are

00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:52,160
built explicitly for our specification

00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:54,720
like explicitly for our specification we

00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:56,730
these things will probably not work too

00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:58,700
well in somebody else's design system

00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:01,350
and they're not

00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:02,820
that was but that's why these are open

00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,170
these are not open source because

00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:06,359
they're largely not going to help

00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:08,340
anybody sometimes people when you have

00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:10,800
an open source framework or an open

00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,900
source library it has to account for so

00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:15,600
many use cases that it ends up becoming

00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,880
much more complex and needs to be and if

00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:20,070
you desire it tightly to your own system

00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:24,150
you get to take advantage of that system

00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:26,369
and simplicity over configuration make

00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:28,560
components can't be goofed up I said

00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:30,210
this like eight hundred times now but we

00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:33,720
shouldn't be able to drop something into

00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:35,640
a component and great so try when you

00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,010
make these components if they're being

00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,900
put into the right spaces the the cards

00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:42,030
on the sheet on the page or whatever and

00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,530
something doesn't look right then you

00:58:42,030 --> 00:58:45,330
need to evaluate why that doesn't look

00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:50,490
right and usually the answer comes from

00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:52,560
simplicity simplifying things so you

00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:56,940
don't need a grid system at least not in

00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:58,830
twenty twenty twenty granted flexbox in

00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:00,720
grid it can't be on every single website

00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:03,030
due to browsers

00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:04,920
being that you know that fun stuff but

00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:07,500
if you have the opportunity and you have

00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,840
the ability to CSS grid is the absolute

00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,990
jewel to use to make your code so much

00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:15,300
more simple I remember the days of you

00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:17,070
know in the 960 grid system and then we

00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:19,320
had the bootstrap grid and then we had

00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:21,420
sass with Suzy which like one of my

00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,010
favorites and then stylus with a I

00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,060
forget what stylus head but there was a

00:59:23,010 --> 00:59:25,830
whole bunch of these different grid

00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,510
systems and they were always making your

00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:29,220
life so much easier by saying alright

00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:31,920
make this thing one column two columns

00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:34,140
whatever we got CSS grid now you can

00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,330
just say hey here's a grid it's going to

00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:39,359
be this many columns and if Nathan agust

00:59:36,330 --> 00:59:42,180
really nice and easily on display out so

00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:44,820
use CSS grid in absolute whenever

00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:46,980
possible and obviously use flexbox as

00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:48,930
well by now there is no reason why you

00:59:46,980 --> 00:59:52,380
should be using flexbox on absolutely

00:59:48,930 --> 00:59:53,700
everything I saw a new site design that

00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,770
was working on the other day that was

00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:58,290
using floats and it just like made me

00:59:55,770 --> 01:00:00,660
really upset because no not because it

00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:02,310
didn't make me upset at the developers

01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:04,890
the developers doing a job right but

01:00:02,310 --> 01:00:08,310
floats over complicate so many things

01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:10,210
was that they were ever be anyway based

01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:13,510
in that third of

01:00:10,210 --> 01:00:17,170
so having a tool like flexbox in your

01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:19,180
toolkit CSS grid go long way um largely

01:00:17,170 --> 01:00:21,910
a lot of the reasons why people even use

01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:25,380
the framework were do use a CSS grid

01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:28,900
right so you might not need a framework

01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:30,849
it's a bold bold statement coming from a

01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:33,670
non designer you might not need a non

01:00:30,849 --> 01:00:36,670
design framework frameworks often give

01:00:33,670 --> 01:00:38,230
you overhead of KB's you get that code

01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:40,000
edit to your site I think you're not

01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:42,250
even using and you also have the

01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,710
onboarding here instead of learning the

01:00:42,250 --> 01:00:47,380
platform right instead of being a better

01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:49,720
CSS developer in spending the time

01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:51,040
learning CSS which is a core tool you're

01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,349
spending the time learning the

01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:57,550
intricacies of alright I need to use

01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:59,530
this class now to deal with the negative

01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:01,270
margin thing that the bootstrap grid

01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:03,430
added and you have to learn of those

01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:05,349
intricacies of these individual

01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:07,270
platforms because all of these platforms

01:01:05,349 --> 01:01:09,099
while they're at the outset they're

01:01:07,270 --> 01:01:10,869
there to be easy the moment you need to

01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:14,500
start doing anything different with them

01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:16,839
it gets into specific knowledge

01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:19,839
territory the specific knowledge

01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:21,730
territory is only a good thing if it's

01:01:19,839 --> 01:01:24,670
going to make your life easier over the

01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:27,310
course of a long period of time now I

01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:29,140
don't know about you but I haven't

01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:31,570
touched bootstrap in a long time and

01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:33,910
even when I did each time I picked up

01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:35,320
bootstrap or foundation it was a new

01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:36,760
version or a slightly different or

01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:39,099
built-in sass this time we're built

01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:40,510
unless this other time or whatever and I

01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,040
had to go learn something new it wasn't

01:01:40,510 --> 01:01:43,750
like I could reuse all of that

01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,830
functionality over and over again I

01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:46,810
always had to learn something new about

01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:49,900
it anyways where you could always just

01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:52,920
pick up CSS and get good at it so write

01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:55,660
only what you need in your system

01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,640
because if you have all that extra fluff

01:01:55,660 --> 01:01:59,589
what's it doing in your life braids

01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:01,780
taking up space it's just sitting there

01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:03,430
just taking a brain space and it's it's

01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:06,460
there to potentially complicate your

01:02:03,430 --> 01:02:08,800
system use variables as the backbone is

01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:11,440
your system if you use variables as the

01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:12,609
backbone of your system for a type and

01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,859
everything with that you can make a

01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:17,500
large sweeping changes to your site and

01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:19,210
see them play out visually in front of

01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:22,250
you in one fell swoop and this is

01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:24,530
different CSS

01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:27,110
this is different from like a post

01:02:24,530 --> 01:02:30,410
processor a preprocessor variable

01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:33,860
specifically because me POP and level of

01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:36,200
tutorial is one more time because part

01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:39,200
of what makes these things cool about

01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:42,770
them being reactive in this sort of way

01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:45,340
is that we can modify them within our

01:02:42,770 --> 01:02:47,900
dev tools and it really nice an easy way

01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:51,110
Becht I think if you just scroll down

01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:53,300
you can see CR overrides like let's say

01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:55,850
I'm tweaking as I design and I want to

01:02:53,300 --> 01:03:00,440
see how this whole thing how the entire

01:02:55,850 --> 01:03:01,070
site would look if the let's do

01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,350
something different

01:03:01,070 --> 01:03:06,160
other than in colors let's say I wanted

01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:09,020
the entire site to be a mono fight a

01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:17,060
montemagno fight a mono font we could do

01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:20,300
- - header header the text oh boy I

01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:22,340
don't know my a header font header head

01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,780
heading font heading font is my

01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:25,400
fluffer-nut naming he's a pro really

01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:26,900
let's say I wanted to change the heading

01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:30,170
font of the entire site to something

01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:34,310
mono I'm using mono Lisa right now Lisa

01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:36,170
and look not only did I change one

01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:38,240
heading what better I've now been able

01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:41,930
to see the entire site update either

01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:44,090
live refreshable and removable anything

01:03:41,930 --> 01:03:46,460
and here we go look at that the entire

01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:49,190
every single thing that was a heading

01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:51,560
before is now mono Lisa now granted the

01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:53,960
spacing still needs tweaking or whatever

01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:57,170
but it works throughout the entire site

01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:58,780
by changing one value one value look at

01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:00,800
that uhm

01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:02,960
look at that you can you can experiment

01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,120
with some fancy new color schemes so

01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,470
again this is just when you have

01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,690
variables it's the backbone for your

01:04:06,470 --> 01:04:11,540
system it's really easy to make large

01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:13,280
sweeping changes for your system and

01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:15,530
when you're able to make large sweeping

01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:18,970
changes to your system you're able to

01:04:15,530 --> 01:04:20,930
update modify fix improve without

01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:22,670
jeopardizing the stability of your

01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:24,830
system because you're not having to go

01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:26,950
into each individual property you will

01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:31,580
find and release and change in whatever

01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:34,430
so always use variables for any color

01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:35,470
typography spacing and again your site

01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:37,599
will be up to

01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:38,859
Lon fell swoop hey I said that and I

01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:43,349
wrote that I do I didn't even realize

01:04:38,859 --> 01:04:45,580
I'd written that exact language there

01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:47,109
you have to worry about creating unique

01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:50,440
custom components if they're all used in

01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:52,780
custom properties so when might you need

01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,430
to do use a framework there are are

01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,960
situations where you might need to use a

01:04:54,430 --> 01:04:58,390
framework and that's largely if you need

01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,400
to get it done really quickly this type

01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:02,140
of system is not really suited for

01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,420
working super fast unless of course you

01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:08,890
have your own system which goes back to

01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:10,599
that xkcd joke about you know I'm gonna

01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:12,280
create a new platform just solve this

01:05:10,599 --> 01:05:15,040
problem and now there's another

01:05:12,280 --> 01:05:17,980
competing solution to the problems

01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:19,599
whatever so either way if it needs to be

01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,150
done quickly these kind of things are

01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:24,190
not suitable because they're not it's

01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:26,470
not a fast solution but once you have

01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:28,480
your system in place let me tell you it

01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,580
could not be any easier to add a brand

01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,770
new component level up tutorials calm

01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:33,970
right now because we don't have anything

01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:35,770
to get in the way we don't have to make

01:05:33,970 --> 01:05:39,550
any decisions just drop that thing in

01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:41,710
there and it works if you'd like to do

01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:44,109
any additional reading on this design

01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:45,849
systems calm is created by Sigma which

01:05:44,109 --> 01:05:48,099
is my design application of choice and

01:05:45,849 --> 01:05:50,349
actually we created the entire design

01:05:48,099 --> 01:05:53,020
system within Sigma before even taking

01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:55,330
it into code I check out design

01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:56,609
system.com really really great resource

01:05:55,330 --> 01:06:00,310
for learning more about these things

01:05:56,609 --> 01:06:02,380
design systems are a large body of

01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:04,450
reading over a halt but once you get the

01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:06,040
basics as developers it's really easy to

01:06:04,450 --> 01:06:08,109
thinking these kind of systems and

01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:10,690
replace any sort of decision making

01:06:08,109 --> 01:06:13,660
decision fatigue you might get again

01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:15,609
Heyward on the Internet Explorer it's a

01:06:13,660 --> 01:06:19,320
huge mega bummer that ie does not

01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:21,550
support mega CSS variables in IE 11

01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:23,740
because the fall backs aren't super good

01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:25,030
there are some fall backs I don't

01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:26,109
necessarily know if I would recommend

01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:28,690
them that's why I don't have anything

01:06:26,109 --> 01:06:31,480
linked here at least the time of year I

01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:33,790
I don't love the fall back system or CSS

01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:37,089
properties because largely what it

01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:39,430
involves is coding the same color

01:06:37,089 --> 01:06:42,790
roughly twice what did what I mean is

01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:46,119
that if you had a situation like this

01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:49,210
background of our card BG you would have

01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:53,680
to say alright this is also why I'd like

01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:55,150
this like this because if the browser

01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,740
comes across this line it wouldn't

01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:58,119
understand it but it wouldn't understand

01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,589
this once therefore it would just

01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:01,810
default to having the background be

01:06:59,589 --> 01:07:03,730
white that's certainly a possibility but

01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:06,160
I never like having that double property

01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:10,359
declaration it just feels icky to me not

01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:11,530
a huge fan so thank you I think that's

01:07:10,359 --> 01:07:13,599
all I have for now I'm gonna put on my

01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:16,869
headphones in case I need to hear

01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:19,300
anything when I get any feedback

01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:21,400
check code syntax FM as well as level up

01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:24,820
tutorials a.com we just released a

01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,470
course on designing systems but their

01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:28,630
design systems within figma

01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:31,270
not specifically within code we only

01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:34,710
primarily keep it to Big Mac and it's

01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:34,710
the text FM twice-weekly

01:07:36,479 --> 01:07:41,619
thank you so much

01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:44,890
thank you so much Scott thanks for the

01:07:41,619 --> 01:07:48,280
amazing talk so now it's time for

01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:51,849
question and the first question is what

01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:55,960
is the name of your dog oh yes my dog

01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:58,690
her name is Luci boon and she is a

01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,490
Hungarian Puli which is the dreadlock

01:07:58,690 --> 01:08:02,560
dog that you may have seen the firm the

01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:14,680
Internet she looked like a mop she looks

01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:16,779
like a white mop where of the pulley

01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:18,310
because I think it's a much more common

01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:20,259
buried there than it is here there's

01:08:18,310 --> 01:08:23,770
absolutely there's not a lot of affair

01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:25,509
yeah yeah was the beautiful dog by the

01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:27,609
base was not disturbing at all so don't

01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:32,350
worry about it oh good yeah she was

01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:35,529
going on self yes the first question is

01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:40,060
from Sager and he is asking do you use

01:08:35,529 --> 01:08:42,100
grease to hide the content if he's so do

01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:45,790
you define it settings with CSS

01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:48,940
variables what was the first part do you

01:08:45,790 --> 01:08:53,230
use greets to align the content I used a

01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:55,000
CSS crit and that's basically it so the

01:08:53,230 --> 01:08:58,299
grid component that I showed off very

01:08:55,000 --> 01:09:00,790
briefly inside of our layouts was simply

01:08:58,299 --> 01:09:03,009
just the the code was really just let me

01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:06,759
read it here just will a grid grid gap

01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:08,650
of 20 pixels margin zero and then we

01:09:06,759 --> 01:09:10,150
defined how many grid template columns

01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:13,870
that were based on a variable that

01:09:10,150 --> 01:09:17,109
changed so I only use CSS grid largely

01:09:13,870 --> 01:09:19,150
because the the grids that they offer in

01:09:17,109 --> 01:09:20,620
post processors or other libraries they

01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:24,460
don't really give you that much when you

01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:26,650
when you look at it it's they're not

01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:28,029
there is something like snap and

01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:30,940
whatever but for the most part I think

01:09:28,029 --> 01:09:33,040
the WebP is just so fluid that building

01:09:30,940 --> 01:09:38,080
a fluid grid is is maybe a better idea

01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:40,509
for most projects but you know so next

01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,790
question is from Chris

01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:46,210
I always find it strange when updating

01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:48,700
are the CSS variables unique defining

01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:51,279
the to update to the variable inside the

01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:55,880
selector does that but

01:09:51,279 --> 01:10:00,110
that's correct yes and the way I changed

01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:01,550
that and get around on that so so the in

01:10:00,110 --> 01:10:03,949
the code you saw a lot of the things

01:10:01,550 --> 01:10:05,329
defined in the root scope right and the

01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:08,689
root scope is for your entire project

01:10:05,329 --> 01:10:12,739
and then anytime I wanted to do an over

01:10:08,689 --> 01:10:17,449
bridle the even birds for thing oh hey

01:10:12,739 --> 01:10:19,429
buddy a class but in addition you can do

01:10:17,449 --> 01:10:20,929
so within all sorts of things like for

01:10:19,429 --> 01:10:23,659
instance our base font size is

01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:28,880
overwritten with a media query and

01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:31,039
that's yeah please come in I think so

01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,070
the next question is also from Chris and

01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:36,829
he is asking I see you use CSS variables

01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:39,610
instead components was the reason for

01:10:36,829 --> 01:10:42,829
not used the style component being

01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:45,229
functionality yeah because one I don't

01:10:42,829 --> 01:10:48,170
like it um it's a lot of extra code so

01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:49,550
to use the theming system that comes in

01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:51,559
style components it involves using

01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:53,329
javascript functions to pull out

01:10:51,559 --> 01:10:57,139
variables and your whole system is

01:10:53,329 --> 01:10:59,689
really tightly compiled or on a compile

01:10:57,139 --> 01:11:01,789
it's really tightly a stuck to using

01:10:59,689 --> 01:11:04,459
styled components that puts your entire

01:11:01,789 --> 01:11:07,639
design system so tightly using two style

01:11:04,459 --> 01:11:09,709
components that I can't quickly and

01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:12,739
easily move off of that not that I need

01:11:09,709 --> 01:11:14,090
to or I want to but I don't I I don't

01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:16,610
want to spend my time learning something

01:11:14,090 --> 01:11:18,559
that is this platform I want to buy my

01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:20,449
time learning something that is v

01:11:18,559 --> 01:11:22,849
platform right not this specific

01:11:20,449 --> 01:11:26,030
platform but CSS has the platform so I

01:11:22,849 --> 01:11:27,320
chose CSS variables because one its way

01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:28,550
easier to use you don't have import

01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:29,780
anything you don't have to use any

01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:32,869
JavaScript functions it's just

01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:34,939
unnecessary the CSS variables for me

01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:38,119
keeps it all within CS it also led us to

01:11:34,939 --> 01:11:40,249
do fix leg for instance our global CSS

01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:42,709
initially was in a solid components

01:11:40,249 --> 01:11:45,439
global CSS selector is like a stock

01:11:42,709 --> 01:11:48,170
components global CSS component but we

01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:50,599
hit some really weird Safari bugs on

01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:53,269
with SS our rows causing the CPU to

01:11:50,599 --> 01:11:55,429
skyrocket and if you commented out the

01:11:53,269 --> 01:11:57,619
global CSS it all went away so what I

01:11:55,429 --> 01:12:00,530
did is I just took that CS copy that

01:11:57,619 --> 01:12:02,570
copied it and pasted it into a s CSS

01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:04,880
file and it still worked the exact same

01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:06,440
way so it allowed me to at least me

01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:11,030
modifications like that just by keeping

01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:12,800
things close to the CSS platform so the

01:12:11,030 --> 01:12:15,860
next one is not a question but a remark

01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:18,620
I was just using style but then I

01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:22,630
discovered clear mind and all is done

01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:22,630
OCC s no slight components

01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:31,010
never told them so yeah a related

01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,890
question again from Chris Kent

01:12:31,010 --> 01:12:37,550
frameworks like kale wine a CSS replace

01:12:33,890 --> 01:12:39,860
the need for CSS really was a surplus

01:12:37,550 --> 01:12:44,330
things become descriptive on all the

01:12:39,860 --> 01:12:47,120
colors in DC that are used I don't I

01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:50,420
don't think so and I don't you know i

01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:51,620
I've had I've had a lot of people tell

01:12:50,420 --> 01:12:53,060
me that tailwind is where it's at and

01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:55,160
I've use tail and tail ones behind but

01:12:53,060 --> 01:12:57,110
to me at the end of it like tailwind is

01:12:55,160 --> 01:12:58,520
like a great platform so I'm not trying

01:12:57,110 --> 01:13:01,790
to slight tail when in any sort of way

01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:03,920
whatsoever but for me I am NOT gonna

01:13:01,790 --> 01:13:04,340
pluie my HTML with a thousand classes

01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,860
also

01:13:04,340 --> 01:13:08,810
Taylan has a very specific rented

01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:10,610
there's is within a system there's still

01:13:08,810 --> 01:13:12,890
very specific classes you're still tying

01:13:10,610 --> 01:13:14,630
your knowledge so closely to that system

01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:17,150
you have to remember these specific

01:13:14,630 --> 01:13:18,890
sequence of keys whatever

01:13:17,150 --> 01:13:21,380
and that's still somebody else's system

01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:23,120
that's been built for you know every use

01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:25,490
case scenario not one system that's been

01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:27,980
built just for you so for me I like to

01:13:25,490 --> 01:13:30,050
keep my HTML much cleaner I don't like

01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:33,020
to have if I'm using like been

01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:35,030
styles.css we've been just normal CSS

01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:38,480
rather than style of components I don't

01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:45,320
like to have 800 classes on each of my

01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:48,380
elements obviously that's being uh you

01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:51,880
know a little little intense there about

01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:55,190
like I think that if you have one class

01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:56,510
one whatever it's it's much better than

01:13:55,190 --> 01:13:58,550
having you memorize a whole bunch of

01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:00,320
classes from some other system and it's

01:13:58,550 --> 01:14:02,720
almost like that almost becomes writing

01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:05,060
inline Styles it's just somebody else's

01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:08,810
idea what CSS should be to make things

01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:13,040
easier so luckily I learned to stay away

01:14:08,810 --> 01:14:15,020
from doing things like that so the next

01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:17,720
finalist from Philly a little bit may be

01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:19,670
off question are you standing does it

01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:24,020
keep your back happy and do you stand on

01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:26,330
your coding I am standing I am standing

01:14:24,020 --> 01:14:30,080
I have a learner's like anti-fatigue

01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:31,460
mats I stand and you know I'm it's funny

01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:32,270
yeah I don't know if you get it here

01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:35,000
because I don't know if you got my video

01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:36,330
I'm a bit I'm bit bopping around a lot I

01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,880
I move around a lot of

01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:40,440
a dancer some always I'm always moving

01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,080
when I'm coding or typing so I got to be

01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:46,650
able to stand up but I met a system desk

01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:49,230
and I have I have a lot of options for

01:14:46,650 --> 01:14:51,840
sitting here I have a a saddle chair I

01:14:49,230 --> 01:14:53,700
have a normal chair and my desk is low

01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:55,320
enough that I occasionally and by

01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:58,650
occasionally I mean on the daily and

01:14:55,320 --> 01:15:00,780
kneeling or practicing my my splits

01:14:58,650 --> 01:15:03,210
something on the floor while I'm working

01:15:00,780 --> 01:15:06,140
so I I changed like eight hundred times

01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:10,380
a day it is the constant change it be

01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:13,650
awesome so next question is from Agathon

01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:15,240
she's asking how can I get lost in so

01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:17,100
many variables while cooling

01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:19,230
have you checked them all the time I

01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:21,630
mean naming something heading number

01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:25,140
five usually you don't remember if it

01:15:21,630 --> 01:15:27,300
was one point five REM or two areum

01:15:25,140 --> 01:15:31,290
have you used four components some dogs

01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:34,110
like storybook or dog Z I have used ox t

01:15:31,290 --> 01:15:36,720
is like I've uh I loved oxy and every

01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:38,340
single time I looked at doc CI I think I

01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:40,500
want to use it and I go to use it and

01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:42,450
never works on the project that I meant

01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:44,550
so I loved oxy but alike

01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:47,070
always gives me trouble story book yeah

01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:48,690
we had it in love pictorial at one point

01:15:47,070 --> 01:15:51,480
but it just became too much work to

01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:52,890
maintain while we did everything else as

01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,660
far as me remembering things I think

01:15:52,890 --> 01:15:57,270
what you need to do is this fundamental

01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:59,430
shift and how you think because again

01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:02,010
our system is our system we think in our

01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:04,650
system we don't think in rammed and M's

01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:06,780
anymore I could not tell you like I

01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:09,000
designed in rope the CSS from scratch

01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:11,850
myself and I could not tell you what any

01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,740
of the em and REM values are for many of

01:16:11,850 --> 01:16:15,420
the headings because I don't even think

01:16:13,740 --> 01:16:17,550
about them I when I look at my site I

01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:20,340
don't see an M R M I see this is an h2

01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:22,230
this isn't h3 whatever this is an extra

01:16:20,340 --> 01:16:24,930
extra heading this is a huge heading

01:16:22,230 --> 01:16:27,600
whatever so you need to like think in

01:16:24,930 --> 01:16:29,880
within your variable system and whatever

01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,520
that is like because it's your system

01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:34,320
it's designed for you and your team to

01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:36,120
work efficiently so you could to make

01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:38,430
those choices you're not relying on

01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:40,560
somebody else's predefined it terming if

01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:43,080
you want to say this is a vital one t1

01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,880
t2 t3 your family would Terminator or

01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:46,830
something you could have that be that

01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,060
and that just works it's all about

01:16:46,830 --> 01:16:54,210
whatever works for you in your system

01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:55,980
yeah allium saying he's tried and he's

01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:58,139
sorry but would love to watch the

01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:59,310
YouTube we will upload this until

01:16:58,139 --> 01:17:03,179
YouTube so don't worry

01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:06,050
alien how you have that online Victor is

01:17:03,179 --> 01:17:10,290
saying that you have an amazing voice

01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:12,810
actually I forget to mention that you

01:17:10,290 --> 01:17:16,770
are was a breakdancer and actually I saw

01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:19,110
the origin story the story of level up

01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:21,840
tutorial how do you start it and you

01:17:19,110 --> 01:17:26,250
might share that story because I think

01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:28,469
it's a yeah so okay so if you haven't

01:17:26,250 --> 01:17:31,350
seen this a honey pot at honey pot Del

01:17:28,469 --> 01:17:32,940
Rio they did amazing series of YouTube

01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:35,040
documentary's they did the view jazz

01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:36,540
documentary the graph QL what well they

01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:38,699
did a little miniature documentary on me

01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,929
and the history level up tutorials so if

01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:41,909
you want to find it if you want to get

01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:44,190
the whole story it's on on YouTube it's

01:17:41,909 --> 01:17:46,170
really super good but what happened was

01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:51,239
so I've been I've been dancing or

01:17:46,170 --> 01:17:54,179
breakdancing b-boying for its 2007 for a

01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:57,060
long time now and I did halftime shows

01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:59,909
four major NFL teams NBA teams and stuff

01:17:57,060 --> 01:18:02,670
I went around us performing and in 2012

01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:06,020
I smacked my head really bad and I got a

01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:08,340
big old concussion that's I like me for

01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:10,679
well sidelined me for almost an entire

01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:14,340
year from like all physical activity I

01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:17,130
was seeing a neuro psychologist or neuro

01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:21,389
sports therapist notice psychologist I'm

01:18:17,130 --> 01:18:24,600
sorry at the University of Michigan who

01:18:21,389 --> 01:18:26,280
watches professional NFL players who

01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,929
watches them for concussion so I was

01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,150
like seeing legit people about this and

01:18:27,929 --> 01:18:32,190
like I couldn't do anything so I had

01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:35,010
that concussion in February of 2012 and

01:18:32,190 --> 01:18:37,260
I'm such a busybody that by March of

01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:39,719
2012 I had started the YouTube channel

01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:41,699
and I was pumping out like six YouTube

01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:43,650
videos a week just been cranking through

01:18:41,699 --> 01:18:47,489
its though that that's the short version

01:18:43,650 --> 01:18:50,100
of the story there but in terms of yeah

01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:52,650
by voice for speaking hide I get that

01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,929
comment a lot of people really like my

01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:58,350
voice I never had any intention of doing

01:18:54,929 --> 01:19:01,409
anything with a microphone or speaking

01:18:58,350 --> 01:19:02,969
of any sorts I was never I just wanted

01:19:01,409 --> 01:19:04,920
to be a developer and

01:19:02,969 --> 01:19:07,170
it just sort of just well one day we

01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,870
just did it and people liked it so here

01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:11,219
I am

01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:13,680
thank you so much for sharing this

01:19:11,219 --> 01:19:15,510
Eastern story I think I should be doing

01:19:13,680 --> 01:19:18,320
this times when everybody is stuck at

01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:18,320
home yeah

01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:23,760
so in in asking a question do you

01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:26,370
recommend using CSS frameworks or CSS

01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:30,390
vanilla if I'm trying to be absolutely

01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:32,790
they have been node and react if you are

01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:34,860
trying to be a full stack developer I

01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:37,080
would say you need to understand the

01:19:34,860 --> 01:19:39,210
entire stack I would say recommend

01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,860
putting heavy time into learning CSS I

01:19:39,210 --> 01:19:43,020
mean that's a huge part of the step back

01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:45,210
for the full stack if you're trying to

01:19:43,020 --> 01:19:46,410
be a node developer no I don't I don't

01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:47,910
think you need it if you're trying to be

01:19:46,410 --> 01:19:49,230
a back-end developer frameworks are

01:19:47,910 --> 01:19:51,030
great for those kind of people who

01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:52,980
especially they need something online

01:19:51,030 --> 01:19:54,750
and they need to look pretty good

01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:56,850
they don't need it to be you know

01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:58,710
designed they just needed it to look

01:19:56,850 --> 01:19:59,850
good so throw it up in a frame where

01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,860
could that go and it's gonna look better

01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:04,140
than the default styles and it's most

01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:07,469
likely gonna look better than you you

01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:08,940
try and correlate to design something

01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:11,840
but you know at the end of the day like

01:20:08,940 --> 01:20:15,239
I use a lot of my own projects as

01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:20,190
playgrounds or didn't look like skied

01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:20,550
out of Sporus Tom he's asked grounds for

01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:22,469
me

01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:24,000
they're like level up tutorials is a

01:20:22,469 --> 01:20:26,219
business sure it's a you know it's my

01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:29,610
livelihood but Scott told us key calm I

01:20:26,219 --> 01:20:31,199
can just grow some just janky bad CS

01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:32,489
that's up there just try it for fun who

01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:38,940
cares like it really doesn't matter to

01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:41,699
me so I see we have one person wanting

01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:44,400
to ask a question alive gabber is

01:20:41,699 --> 01:20:47,010
joining the session if I'm not wrong

01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:50,700
hi gab or and you yes

01:20:47,010 --> 01:21:05,790
yeah hi this is from the best land of

01:20:50,700 --> 01:21:08,700
please my question is when you start

01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:09,330
designing a system like this a design

01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:11,280
system

01:21:09,330 --> 01:21:13,680
what do you start do you get the basic

01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,390
components out of the way first and just

01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:19,080
go with what you need

01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:20,850
later as need them or do you get as much

01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:29,040
as you can or something in between which

01:21:20,850 --> 01:21:32,520
what's your approach to this so it's

01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,020
easier for us because we work no it's

01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,550
gone on my glasses here we were coming

01:21:34,020 --> 01:21:40,800
out with a we had basically the entire

01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:42,870
semantic structure of the site already

01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:47,790
in existence when we did our whole

01:21:42,870 --> 01:21:49,530
redesign we only changed CSS so it was a

01:21:47,790 --> 01:21:51,420
little bit sorry it was a little bit

01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,980
easier for us to say little like alright

01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,390
this is a starting point right we have

01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:56,220
some brand guidelines this is like the

01:21:54,390 --> 01:21:57,570
fifth iteration of the site even though

01:21:56,220 --> 01:21:59,640
we're starting to see SMS from scratch

01:21:57,570 --> 01:22:03,870
but if I'm starting a system system I

01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:06,270
usually start with the poor back bones

01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:10,170
of things which is the color right

01:22:06,270 --> 01:22:12,630
colours huge and the typography are both

01:22:10,170 --> 01:22:14,610
huge and color and typography can have

01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:16,770
so much character to your site in fact

01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:20,190
let me um you sure my screen really

01:22:16,770 --> 01:22:24,180
quickly again if I can do that it's

01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:26,640
great this is my actual Figment document

01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:30,180
that we use for our design systems that

01:22:26,640 --> 01:22:32,910
we created before we took it into so we

01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:35,460
made uh you can see these lines this is

01:22:32,910 --> 01:22:39,989
a vertical rhythm grid here where the

01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:42,960
grid is space based off of our body font

01:22:39,989 --> 01:22:44,520
size line line high eight Google if you

01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,590
google a vertical rhythm make you see

01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:48,150
quite a bit more into this actual but we

01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:50,280
just made a grid here here and as long

01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:52,320
as all the text fit on the grid the text

01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:54,090
comes directly out of the pipe scale all

01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:56,790
of the X comes directly out type scale

01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:58,770
here we can look at the say alright well

01:22:56,790 --> 01:23:00,969
this gives us quite a bit right if you

01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:04,909
start throwing this stuff onto a pay

01:23:00,969 --> 01:23:06,409
it's going to start like yeah look if

01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:08,960
you if you throw the stuff onto a pig

01:23:06,409 --> 01:23:10,730
it's gonna start actually making your

01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,110
site look like your site almost

01:23:10,730 --> 01:23:14,000
instantly even though it's just tight

01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:16,040
and between that type and color we

01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,530
already had our color set up so we

01:23:16,040 --> 01:23:22,340
didn't have to that the elevation system

01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:24,770
sure but typography is a big one well

01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:26,480
there's a big one buttons are a big big

01:23:24,770 --> 01:23:29,659
one for some reason buttons really

01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:31,489
changed the look of inputs form inputs

01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:33,800
those things changed a lot so I usually

01:23:31,489 --> 01:23:36,170
start with these core components and if

01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:38,449
you use something like figma any of

01:23:36,170 --> 01:23:41,360
these I recommend figma cuz the best in

01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:43,639
my mind but if you use something like

01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:46,730
this you can create a component system

01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:50,750
but you end up having like it in figma

01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:52,909
here we have this assets people now

01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:54,860
anytime we want to make a design it's

01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:57,380
almost like using a prototyping software

01:23:54,860 --> 01:23:59,290
this just exists like if I wanted to

01:23:57,380 --> 01:24:01,429
throw something together really quickly

01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:04,369
like here's a debate all I want to throw

01:24:01,429 --> 01:24:06,920
is to get there and I need a new button

01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:09,590
here it is I need some course cards

01:24:06,920 --> 01:24:13,460
whatever and we built all this stuff but

01:24:09,590 --> 01:24:15,260
I it's all just laco pieces yeah it

01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:28,219
should be developed these LEGO pieces

01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:32,030
that just work for me wherever I can and

01:24:28,219 --> 01:24:36,290
just a small question to a chef here for

01:24:32,030 --> 01:24:40,940
me how do you do the fancy arrows and

01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:43,099
the equal signs and yes do you think

01:24:40,940 --> 01:24:48,920
they're a good idea for search ability

01:24:43,099 --> 01:24:50,239
and ifs and everything yeah let me share

01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:52,730
my screen once more I'm gonna do that

01:24:50,239 --> 01:24:54,440
again I'll say yeah I keep it on my

01:24:52,730 --> 01:25:00,980
glasses are frog in these lights are hot

01:24:54,440 --> 01:25:03,800
so ah get out okay

01:25:00,980 --> 01:25:10,420
the show must go on you were correct all

01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:13,420
right you see uh CSS here yep okay so

01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:13,420
even

01:25:13,499 --> 01:25:19,030
let me go into you the fun thing about

01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:21,639
being living my codebase and I've heard

01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:22,960
it all myself is I look like I could do

01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:26,159
code demos just by poking around this

01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:29,789
thing it's like I'm just using it so

01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:32,530
let's choose this euro component see so

01:25:29,789 --> 01:25:33,849
when he's referring to is this arrow

01:25:32,530 --> 01:25:35,710
here and what these are called

01:25:33,849 --> 01:25:37,480
ligatures in the fund so this is

01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:39,940
actually built into the font itself and

01:25:37,480 --> 01:25:42,999
this font that I'm using is called mono

01:25:39,940 --> 01:25:44,199
Lisa but a your code operator mono or

01:25:42,999 --> 01:25:45,909
other ones you may have seen that do

01:25:44,199 --> 01:25:47,559
this and all you have to do it was turn

01:25:45,909 --> 01:25:49,449
on ligature support within your code

01:25:47,559 --> 01:25:51,249
editor whatever that may be

01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:53,800
so if I were to say you know like hero

01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:57,460
is equal to whatever to get this arrow

01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:59,440
all you do is the same y equals greater

01:25:57,460 --> 01:26:00,730
than and it just it's just a display

01:25:59,440 --> 01:26:01,929
thing and if you get rid of one

01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:04,389
character it goes away

01:26:01,929 --> 01:26:06,460
so if first fund ability readability

01:26:04,389 --> 01:26:08,139
it's all just tags and if you were to oh

01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,949
this up in another file it would just

01:26:08,139 --> 01:26:13,389
look totally normal

01:26:08,949 --> 01:26:16,659
I personally I I'm a huge visual visual

01:26:13,389 --> 01:26:21,190
thing I needed visuals for everything I

01:26:16,659 --> 01:26:22,960
have a terrible if I read something I'm

01:26:21,190 --> 01:26:24,579
just like I have to lose all my audio

01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,800
books I'm just not good at reading

01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:29,019
really is what it comes down to and so

01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,400
because of that I really rely on symbols

01:26:29,019 --> 01:26:33,340
and things like that you navigate my

01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:42,030
code quickly I also have dyslexia so it

01:26:33,340 --> 01:26:46,960
helps a little bit of that as well yeah

01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:49,210
and for jumping in I'm looking for other

01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:51,550
questions just it's very hard to find

01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:53,559
because there are dozens of compliments

01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:55,050
everybody really enjoyed both of the

01:26:53,559 --> 01:26:58,630
talks

01:26:55,050 --> 01:27:00,670
yeah there is one from Dimitri and do

01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:03,519
you know I opens for these open source

01:27:00,670 --> 01:27:06,460
designing systems are the two z CSS

01:27:03,519 --> 01:27:08,380
variables don't I'd be interested to

01:27:06,460 --> 01:27:09,909
check them out though I'm sure there are

01:27:08,380 --> 01:27:11,110
I'm sure there I'm sure there's

01:27:09,909 --> 01:27:12,519
definitely some if you google around

01:27:11,110 --> 01:27:15,579
about it but I haven't I haven't looked

01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:17,349
at any personally I always era like if

01:27:15,579 --> 01:27:18,909
you have the time maybe if there's like

01:27:17,349 --> 01:27:20,559
one use this is a jumping-off point

01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:23,559
yeah copy and paste it and start from

01:27:20,559 --> 01:27:25,350
there but there's such a um there's such

01:27:23,559 --> 01:27:27,060
a wonderful thing about

01:27:25,350 --> 01:27:29,610
having the system be something that you

01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,170
created because if you create it it's

01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:33,570
almost like when you're following a

01:27:31,170 --> 01:27:35,220
tutorial if you follow a tutorial and

01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:37,080
you just press every key that they're

01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:39,800
pressing when they press it you don't

01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,790
learn as much as you learn if you are

01:27:39,800 --> 01:27:42,960
saying you know what I'm gonna brand

01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:44,820
shut off and instead of naming this

01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,560
thing header1 I'm gonna name it heading

01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:48,060
one you know it's like when it becomes

01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,940
your own thing you learn it a little bit

01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:54,900
more tightly and that's me it is a big

01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:57,030
thing yeah a lot of people are asking if

01:27:54,900 --> 01:27:59,070
there will be a recording and yes there

01:27:57,030 --> 01:28:02,330
will be I'm to be uploaded to YouTube

01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:04,770
and also share the honor section huh

01:28:02,330 --> 01:28:08,370
any more question

01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:09,930
