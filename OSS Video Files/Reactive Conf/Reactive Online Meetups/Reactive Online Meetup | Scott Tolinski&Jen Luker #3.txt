Forbidden Planet Cured my Imposter Syndrome


𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
Come with me on an adventure with a heroic robot, a mad scientist, a feminist, a pilot, and our monster, imposter syndrome. Let me share how a sci-fi movie from 1956, starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen, taught me how to recognize imposter syndrome not as the monster hellbent on ruining my romance with an ever-evolving development ecosystem, but as a tool to prevent burnout.

Jen Luker is a Sr. Frontend Engineer, conference speaker, and BookBytes podcast co-host. She has spent the majority of her career as a full-stack developer using PHP, Javascript, and CSS, but has a particular fondness for frontend technologies. She is an advocate for both accessibility, and processes that make doing the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard. When she's not exploring solutions, learning new technologies, or reading, Jen's spare time is spent spinning yarn from raw wool and knitting; she's even been known to 3D print her own tools for the job. She is also fascinated by all things space, antique cars, and IoT.

Building Your Own Design System with CSS Variables

𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
You probably don’t need a CSS framework. While CSS Frameworks are wonderful and certainly have their place in the development landscape, they are often overused in place of a custom solution. In this talk, we’ll look at how you can abandon the bloat and overhead of a CSS framework and quickly build a robust design system of components tuned to your needs using CSS variables.
