Scaling your projects with Micro-frontends

𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
Micro-frontends are a new architectural trend in the development of front-end applications. This architectural style can provide tremendous benefits to your projects and organization, offering a level of decoupling never seen before in single-page applications or universal architectures. That said, micro-frontends need to be explored in practice. Luckily there are already a few companies using them at scale.
Drawing on his work at DAZN, Luca Mezzalira explains how to implement micro-frontends, enabling you to scale up a project with tens of developers without reducing the throughput.

The Micro-frontend Revolution: Using Webpack 5 Module Federation with Angular

𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
The implementation of micro frontends has so far been anything but easy. Since common frameworks and build tools did not even know this idea, you had to dig into the bag of tricks. Module Federation offered by Webpack 5 initiates a crucial change of direction here. It allows you to load separately compiled applications at runtime and to share libraries between them.
In this session, you will learn how you can use this mechanism to create micro frontends with Angular. In addition to the happy day scenarios, we also discuss pitfalls and approaches to avoid them. Furthermore, we take a look at possible alternatives. At the end of the session, you have an overview of the topic and know how you can use Module Federation in your projects and what the consequences are.
