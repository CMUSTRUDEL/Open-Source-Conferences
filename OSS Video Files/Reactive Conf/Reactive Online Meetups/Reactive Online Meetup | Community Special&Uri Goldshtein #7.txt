TALK
GraphQL Mesh – Why GraphQL between services is the worst idea and the best idea at the same time!

TALK ABSTRACT
We all heard about the benefits of using GraphQL between the client and server, but when it comes to communication between services on the backend there is still a lot of discussions about different philosophies and solutions. Should you use Federation, Stitching, or not use GraphQL at all? In this talk, I’m going to demonstrate each approach, show the downsides of each of them, and reveal a new, radical approach that brings the best of all worlds.

BIO
Long time open source veteran. Started The Guild to create a sustainable way of building and maintaining open source. A big believer in GraphQL. Worked in Apollo, collaborated with Facebook on the GraphQL Subscriptions spec, and create many famous open source libraries.

over to virtual meetups which is an

00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:35,990
awesome way to keep the community

from Poland I'm here can you hear me yes

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,889
great hi Anna hi thank you so much for

00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:21,349
the invitation I still consider reactive

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,740
conf as the best conference have been so

00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:27,050
far so this online meeting reminds me of

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,960
all beautiful people I've met there so

00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,149
thank you so much just to introduce

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:34,849
myself my name is Adam romansky but

00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:37,430
everybody calls me Roman that's why I've

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,729
created hello Roman YouTube channel

00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:44,230
where I gathered a lovely and engaged

00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,130
community of 40,000 developers in Poland

00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:49,250
unfortunately all my videos are in

00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:52,160
Polish so I cannot invite you unless you

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,740
speak polish but I'm trying to help

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,329
others to gain new skills and maybe

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,500
discover some new technologies

00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:02,340
throughout my videos and courses

00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,770
so that's what I do and speaking of

00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:07,560
people I just want to make a very brief

00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,990
speech about about people because I

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,440
think that very often aspiring

00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:15,570
developers concentrate on on the

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,720
technical skills too much and they

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:20,820
forget that the technical skills are

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,250
only the half of the success and the

00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:26,430
other half is the people are the people

00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,620
and no matter where you are on or when

00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,350
you are you don't know if you will not

00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,290
meet your future employer in a moment so

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,120
it's always a good and it it's always a

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,960
good idea to make a good impression and

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,880
to make a new friends and to not be shy

00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,460
of meeting new people because very often

00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,970
the other peoples and the other people

00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:51,300
are just as shy as we are so just be

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:53,700
brave and reach out because great things

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,080
and can happen and during the

00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,690
coronavirus in Poland we observed that

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:03,780
sometimes for one job offer there's like

00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:05,490
400 applications so getting a job is not

00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,760

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,130
is Peter

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,220
I am from Hungary and I'm a mentor at a

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:53,850
green Fox Academy which is Hungary's

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:57,330
first super intense boot camp it was

00:10:53,850 --> 00:11:00,750
founded in 2015 and we had a vision to

00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,750
provide career change opportunities for

00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:05,790
people who don't really like their

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:12,720
current career or just want to change

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:16,589
their life and so in 28

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:19,649
18 we also launched our second office in

00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:23,279
Prague so what we are now in Czechia and

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:26,759
in hungary as well and we are not just

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:31,019
helping them to become junior software

00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:35,639
developers we also provide them help to

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:40,019
to find a inspiring new workplace since

00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:42,779
we started we have over 600 people to

00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:49,439
find a new career in IT and we also

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:52,769
worked with over 90 companies and we are

00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:56,279
not just in a boot camp but we also a

00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:59,129
training center we help companies with

00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:02,839
their digital transformation for example

00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:06,050
we have partners in China and we we do

00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:09,600
in-house trainings for them as well and

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:13,069
during the copied lockdown our situation

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,680
wasn't super difficult because our our

00:12:13,069 --> 00:12:18,870
materials were already online so we

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,809
could immediately transition to online

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:25,110
education but we knew that not everyone

00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:29,129
was so far fortunate and a lot of people

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:31,500
lost their jobs and they their life

00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:33,779
become became more much more difficult

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,899
so we we figured we should do something

00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:39,720
for the community so we launched the so

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:43,319
called stay at home coding camp which is

00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,839
a completely free three week long coding

00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:49,110
camp where they were able to start

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,759
learning programming and try and see if

00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:53,220
this is something they would be

00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:56,490
interested in and of course later they

00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,480
can join one of the boot camps and the

00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:05,970
few of them already joined one of our

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:11,189
courses all in all the stay at home

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:13,589
coding camp was available for over 8,000

00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:19,230
participants so it was it was a huge

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:19,790
huge training camp thank you yeah that's

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:23,779
awesome

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:28,959
thanks a lot Peter

00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:35,510
next we have Pierce janitor and richer

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:36,470
Perino from the Philippines hello hi

in the attendees here in the mean table

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,750
by the way hi I'm Pierce I'm one of the

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:57,139
community leads of the Philippine web

00:13:53,750 --> 00:14:00,920
designers organization or previously

00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:03,199
known as PWD Oh but now we call it Widow

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,410
coming from the Spanish word or their

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,420
meaning to be able to so us the

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:11,209
Philippine web designers organization so

00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:13,250
we are a not-for-profit volunteer group

00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:16,279
aiming to uplift the local web design

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:19,820
community in terms of designs and

00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,680
crafting interfaces for the web so we do

00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:24,740
this by empowering students and

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,500
professionals as well as hobbyists from

00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,360
there with interdisciplinary learning in

00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:33,220
different aspects of design and

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,230
development so from there we hold events

00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:40,870
currently we've held almost a hundred

00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:42,350
events from now coming in the forms of

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,630
conferences

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,819
we have our main conference conference

00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:49,310
called the form function and press

00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:55,819
conference where we've had speakers like

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:57,740
Brad frost and Smashing Magazine so we

00:14:55,819 --> 00:15:00,290
also have our student version for that

00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,970
which we call jf FC or junior form

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,610
function in class and there are other

00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,980
meetups include meet ups charity

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,510
hackathons coding challenges mainly code

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:11,480
in the dark if you're all familiar with

00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:14,149
that and a recent event which arise

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:16,639
during the time of Koval which we call

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:19,670
remote FFC which which are remote

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:23,120
meetups for all the time of kovat we've

00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:25,790
held as mentioned remote forum function

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,670
in class and we entitled our first event

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,850
for that enhanced work from home so that

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,130
more people who suddenly transitioned

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,300
from working through offices into

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:40,750
working by staying at homes or in

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:42,790
remote areas to learn more about the

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:46,630
tips and tricks on how to transition

00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:48,880
into that and why while we were at that

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,400
event so we partnered with user

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,470
experience Philippines another tech

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:56,500
community here in the Philippines

00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:59,020
we've also figured why not bring up a

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,030
donation drive while we were streaming

00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,770
so it's somewhat similar to those who

00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,750
are streaming and then you could donate

00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:08,140
over but in this case we have

00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:10,870
transitioned that into day instead of

00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,050
gaining money for us to prove to fund

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:17,710
our events we would rather put it into a

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:21,250
specific charity for for us to help

00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:24,730
front liners in the country so these are

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,280
the doctors the the main front liners

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:30,100
those who still have jobs even the time

00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:35,020
of couvade by raising money and donating

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:37,990
for them to feed them so also lately

00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:40,180
with the recent different issues that

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,160
are happening in the country all the

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:43,930
more that we have to consider having a

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,870
code of conduct so it's something that I

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,970
wish to hope to share to the tech

00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,690
communities out there you could visit

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:54,610
our website PW do dot Oryx slash conduct

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,240
so that's our code of conduct because we

00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:00,460
believe that everyone deserves an equal

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:03,610
treatment and fair and safe treatment

00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:06,940
once we it was once we perform our

00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:08,740
events that's all for us so again I'm

00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,400

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,870

be here again I visited three ex-cons I

00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,960
think first time in 2000

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:15,010
Bratislava and a year after being moved

00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:19,370
to a proc so it's amazing to see the

00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:21,020
progression and it's in progression they

00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,970
have made it was really really cool I

00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,679
think both editions have been really

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:27,919
amazing couldn't make it last year but

00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,750

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,299
everyone my name is Josie I'm from the

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:34,970
front that love conference organization

00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,039
we stem from actually community

00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:41,919
background we started organizing from

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:44,870
that developer communities meetups in

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,150
2015 already and a certain point they

00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,950
grew so big that we got a question if we

00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:51,200
didn't want to do conferences and that's

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:52,760
when we started to do from the loft

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,860
conferences you might have heard of them

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,960
we organized from that love and he Jess

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,130
Amsterdam and next to that we also

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,870
organized angular and L and react life

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:07,429
for this summer we have plans

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:11,840
our virtual conferences angular and L on

00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:16,010
the 24th July and from that love on that

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,590
20 years and the 21st of August huges

00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:21,380
Amsterdam on the 13th and 14th of August

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:27,049
and react life on the twentieth 28th of

00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:28,970
August and we also did virtual meetup

00:21:27,049 --> 00:21:32,419
straight away actually when kovat kicked

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:34,820
off because we want to work on a

00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:36,919
community gathering of course especially

00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:39,679
in a time that this wasn't possible in

00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:43,990
person we hope to gather the community

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:47,150
in this way yes our organizers also have

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:50,240
upset we still do them you can usually

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:54,500
watch them by our YouTube channel I can

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:59,630
share that later in our in our chats as

00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:01,520
for kovetz we we have seen a lot of

00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:03,470
great initiatives I think it's really

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,270
nice that the only point I wanted to

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,970
make actually was that's really nice see

00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:10,900
that the humanity step this way up into

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,669
the digital era and I think we've seen

00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:16,190
amazing things happen and I think it's a

00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,429
shame that we needed to covert which is

00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,820
or

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:22,970
thing to push a lot of peace ideas

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:24,110
through the day lab tests will been

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,960
frightening over the past three months

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,850
with good causes where people do

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,549
groceries for each other they cook for

00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:34,460
each other entrepreneurs that do like

00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:37,570
online yoga sessions that beer brewers

00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:41,659
that start making hand sanitizers and

00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:49,070
crazy the craziest things javascript

00:22:41,659 --> 00:22:51,559
being used to attract covert 19 and for

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,629
us personally we have decided to to make

00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:56,480
donations from the virtual conferences

00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:59,029
for whatever we can towards covert

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,370
nineteen response fund from the

00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:03,549
w-h-o and to the back lives matter

00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:08,330
[Music]

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:11,720
movement of course which is a horrible

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,580
thing and we wish everybody the best but

00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,470

they were like some coding in the dark I

00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:48,720
think was the term used coding in the

00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:52,050
dark and he said I think that was Pierce

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,080
said that this is some kind of session

00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:57,960
that you organize and I literally have

00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,540
no idea what you mean by coding in the

00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,690
dark like coding in the dark is like

00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,120
coding without Docs or how is that all

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,770
right so good in coding well it's

00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:10,710
actually called good in the dark and

00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:14,520
it's think of it as like um a trademark

00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:17,070
event or like a an event you go done

00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:22,800
code franchise with the organizing group

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:24,510
so usually when we organize code in the

00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:28,050
direct we usually partner with one of

00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:29,940
the members in the panel as well we

00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:31,860
partnered us the Philippine web

00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:36,780
designers organization partnered with

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:39,840
some of Manila CSS when we organized

00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:44,370
so far we've organized two or three

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:47,910
already some of off good in the dark and

00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:52,770
it'll be also had three right yes

00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:55,710
and in essence good in the dark is it's

00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:58,550
a fifteen minute challenge we're in a

00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:01,140
design will be provided to the

00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:04,800
participants and then they have to code

00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:08,100
it without seeing the output all

00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:10,380
straight in 15 minutes so they will be

00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,810
provided with this design and then they

00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,260
have to code it without seeing the

00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:19,290
output all in 15 minutes so essentially

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:22,300
in spin the dark but the setting of the

00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:25,840
event when we still did it in

00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,660
in a in an actual event set up we also

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:32,110
place it in the dark to have the party

00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:35,080
vibes I see is a very good idea very

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:36,820
good idea actually I I love this kind of

00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,860
different ideas coming from the

00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:42,940
community so thanks a lot for the for

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:47,500
the explanation no problem alright so we

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:51,190
are now ready to get into the main talk

00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:54,940
today and I want to I want to join I

00:33:51,190 --> 00:34:00,400
want you to join the call so you really

00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:07,510
around hello can you see me dear me yes

00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:08,560
yes hello how are you doing yeah I'm

00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,770
good I'm good

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:14,740
I mean it's been it's been a while since

00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:17,619
since we talked but I really I really

00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:20,679
like the the talks that you do and of

00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:23,020
course I'm also a big fan of Roth coils

00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:25,990
so I'm very happy for you to be doing

00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:29,109
this talk today so yeah

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:31,780
are you ready you wanna you know I think

00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:35,730
so I mean last time we met I think we

00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,730
met in India doing a party somewhere

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:47,080
graph graph well India yeah also me them

00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:54,070
yeah yeah I'm ready and yeah so should I

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:56,760
start yeah yeah let's start so thanks

00:34:54,070 --> 00:35:02,410
thanks Gerard and thanks everyone for

00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,910
organizing this event and inviting me my

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:09,240
name is Louie and I will talk today

00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:11,950
about graph QL and also some of the

00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,359
let's say the some new tools that we

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:17,859
developed around graph go that might

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,080
help you if you're already using a rough

00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:23,619
girl but also if you are not using

00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:27,790
graphical yet and you want to start in a

00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:34,510
faster way so let me see if I can share

00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:36,930
my screen and someone let me know if you

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:42,760
can see my screen

00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:45,190
yes yes is Joey so my name is Orion I'm

00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,470
a founder of the group that's called the

00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,750
guild

00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:53,170
we're a group that does a lot of

00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:54,970
graffiti or open source we develop a lot

00:35:53,170 --> 00:36:01,089
of libraries around the ecosystem I'll

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:05,579
go through a bit of them mostly we like

00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:08,559
to hear from you so the way we build

00:36:05,579 --> 00:36:10,720
those things is that we work with a lot

00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,089
of different companies usually large

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,059
companies but also we work with a lot of

00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:19,210
smaller companies just for free to help

00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:21,280
them get on board on graph QL and they

00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,890
help us understand their pain points and

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,540
everything so what is most important for

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:32,680
me in this talk is for you to feel free

00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:35,980
to ask questions and also feel free to

00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,490
reach out even if you think it's just a

00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:42,059
small dumb question or whatever just you

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:45,010
know reach out to us we're available and

00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:46,930
in all the channels like Twitter github

00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:48,460
or even you can go to our website and

00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:50,319
there's like a small chat there you can

00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,329
just start chatting around with us

00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:57,369
people are always surprised that we're

00:36:52,329 --> 00:37:00,010
like before answering so yeah so if you

00:36:57,369 --> 00:37:01,839
do use graph kill you probably are using

00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:04,030
one of our libraries one of the most

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,700
popular ones is graphical code generator

00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:08,980
that helps you generate things from

00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:13,569
graph QL from your graphical schema and

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:15,490
your operations graph your inspector

00:37:13,569 --> 00:37:17,440
that make that helps you make sure that

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:19,180
you're not making any big changes and

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,089
validate changes before you go to

00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,579
production graph you'll see a live it

00:37:22,089 --> 00:37:26,890
makes it much easier for you to start

00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:28,780
you can start with just like modeling

00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:30,940
your schema and you can generate the

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,460
whole app that you can just stop working

00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,819
with and a lot of the regular workflows

00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:39,460
are already built in and graphical

00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:41,730
modules which helps you let's say if

00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:43,869
you're using a big team and you want to

00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:45,910
basically modulized

00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:47,349
parts of the schema for each team then

00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:49,890
you can use this tool to make sure

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:52,599
there's a proper separation

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:55,329
and one of the latest libraries that we

00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:56,980
took over is graphical tools it's one of

00:37:55,329 --> 00:38:01,210
the most popular libraries in the edco

00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,640
system and it was I'd maintained for a

00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:07,119
couple of years but Apollo were generous

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,819
and they just handed it over to us and

00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,319
in the recent months we basically

00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:14,440
completely rebuild the library added

00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:16,750
tons of new things really is two major

00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,400
versions and completely rewrote schema

00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,839
staging so if you heard schema staging

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,609
was deprecated or something like that

00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,859
you should check it out again and those

00:38:24,609 --> 00:38:28,720
are just small parts and examples of the

00:38:26,859 --> 00:38:30,730
other libraries that we build and like I

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,279
said the reason we build those libraries

00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:34,509
is because we work with different

00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:36,369
clients and we work with different

00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:39,009
companies and we want to we think

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:41,710
graphical brings a lot of new

00:38:39,009 --> 00:38:43,839
opportunities to make your stack much

00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:46,420
nicer and more productive to work with

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,700
and also more performant but instead of

00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,890
you needing to buy into this huge

00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:53,470
platform or anything like that we

00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:56,500
decided to put it up as a lot of small

00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:58,900
packages that you can gradually you know

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,809
use and use for specific use case and

00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:05,410
slowly get yourself into the platform

00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:09,099
where you see fit and everything is open

00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:11,680
sourced so just feel free to start but

00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:13,809
today I'm gonna give you a bit of

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:15,730
background but then talk about a library

00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:17,369
that is a bit newer one of our newest

00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:21,640
libraries that's called graphical mesh

00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:24,339
which is very exciting for us but before

00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:27,839
that let me give some short introduction

00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:31,690
about graphical so what is graticule

00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:35,829
graphic is a query language and a schema

00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:38,680
so basically you can start by describing

00:39:35,829 --> 00:39:40,750
a schema that describes data in our case

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:43,779
here we describe a project that has a

00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:47,259
name and a tagline contributors that

00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:49,210
data that we describe can be any data so

00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:52,059
it doesn't need to be a database or a

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:55,210
graph database or an API it can be

00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:58,930
anything and even different sources

00:39:55,210 --> 00:40:01,390
completely so that schema can describe

00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:03,369
any data and just by describing that

00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:06,880
schema in a certain way and writing your

00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:09,880
colonists Ordway you can now query that

00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:12,369
schema so you can query for what you

00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,680
want in that case a specific project and

00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:17,950
just the project tagline and you'll get

00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,410
back just what you need back exactly

00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:23,200
it's a predictable result and that's a

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:26,999
very powerful thing so let's see how it

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:29,650
actually works so let's say we have a

00:40:26,999 --> 00:40:32,019
like a server an existing server an

00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:36,279
existing infrastructure that we even can

00:40:32,019 --> 00:40:39,579
control maybe and but we want to expose

00:40:36,279 --> 00:40:42,180
an API for our clients so we can just

00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:45,640
describe a user type in a message type

00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:48,569
now just by describing those basically

00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:53,200
we get this magical graphical engine

00:40:48,569 --> 00:40:55,420
that now the client can query for let's

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,880
say just a specific user and it's name

00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,990
so when a client query for this name

00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:02,680
graticule

00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:04,539
itself will go fetch the user then fetch

00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,339
the name maybe the name comes from the

00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:08,859
same source but maybe it comes from a

00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:12,220
different place but then the client will

00:41:08,859 --> 00:41:16,480
get back one response with exactly what

00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:18,880
they expect now if the client wants more

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,700
it wants a user's name and the messages

00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,920
of that user then again the client will

00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:26,470
send one with one request

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,079
but then the graphical server will send

00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:31,390
will get the user in parallel will get

00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:33,339
the name and the messages and then for

00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:34,869
each message it will get the content now

00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:36,579
maybe the content comes from a

00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:40,900
completely different source like a third

00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:43,660
party API or WordPress the client

00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:48,460
doesn't care the client will get exactly

00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:50,440
what they need in one single response so

00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:54,190
we get performance benefits but we also

00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,079
get predict like much nicer code in my

00:41:54,190 --> 00:42:01,720
stress of less operations that we need

00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:04,119
to do now what the the way we define

00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,609
those things is basically each field so

00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:10,150
let's say the users name we basically

00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:12,400
tell roughly how to fetch it and that

00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,799
fetching its best it's called that it's

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,420
a function that's called resolver in the

00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:18,940
graphical

00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:22,090
language and those resolvers are

00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:24,910
basically very defined functions so we

00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:26,710
know what we're gonna get and then those

00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:29,050
functions can do whatever like do some

00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,730
processing or call the server and we

00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:34,030
know that this function needs to return

00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:37,450
a string now just by defining those

00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:42,040
small tasks that can be easily defined

00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:45,700
and easily also managed between

00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:47,620
different different problems like you

00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:50,980
can give different teams different tasks

00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:53,740
like that now what you've only seen that

00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,750
slide is basically what graphical does

00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,090
automatically so everything you're gonna

00:42:55,750 --> 00:43:00,490
see in that slide what I want you to

00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:04,060
think about well I'm going through that

00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:09,370
slide is that how are you doing to this

00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:11,350
today and we're so so just by defining

00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:14,950
that schema and defining those small

00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:17,650
boxes now I'm sending the graphical

00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:20,470
engine the query to get the user in the

00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:22,560
name of the messages now you can see

00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:25,690
what Russia would do with that

00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,270
information so that will bring the first

00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:31,480
box that get the user will send the

00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:33,160
idæan get back a user object now graph

00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,430
you will see that we run the name of the

00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:40,270
messages so graticule will go in bring

00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:42,340
the right boxes and then execute them in

00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:47,110
parallel with the value that we had

00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:49,990
before now the name is already there so

00:43:47,110 --> 00:43:51,910
we can put it in place but the messages

00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:53,920
we're going to get back three different

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,090
messages and for each message we want

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,940
the title and the date

00:43:55,090 --> 00:44:00,910
so now graphical will bring those boxes

00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,680
for each message we'll run them all in

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:04,810
parallel and put the results in the

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,260
right place and we'll get the response

00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:11,890
that everything you see here graphical

00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:14,740
does automatically for you you don't

00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:17,830
need to do that yourself so that's cool

00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,900
and I won't dive too much into graphical

00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:22,180
here like first of all you can ask me

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,580
questions after the talk and also I have

00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:27,760
a lot of more talks that I go more deep

00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,819
dive into that process so but the thing

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,190
is you know

00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:34,019
so here is that graphical first of all

00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,949
automates a lot of the work for us and

00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:39,509
second of all it gives us types and

00:44:36,949 --> 00:44:42,299
predictability because in those boxes

00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:44,519
between so we know what is the type that

00:44:42,299 --> 00:44:46,829
is going in and we know what is the type

00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:49,349
that's going out so let's say we are

00:44:46,829 --> 00:44:51,180
using type script or let's say we're not

00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:53,459
using type suit but we want to start

00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:57,059
getting Taipings from exact for example

00:44:53,459 --> 00:44:58,829
from Jes Docs just by using and even if

00:44:57,059 --> 00:45:00,239
you use just JavaScript or even if you

00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:02,849
use other language like Java or

00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:06,509
something else just by defining that

00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:09,449
schema we can actually generate using

00:45:06,509 --> 00:45:11,880
graphical code generator types so you

00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:15,719
can see here on that function below on

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,670
the pseudo function we know already what

00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:19,949
are the inputs in the output so we can

00:45:17,670 --> 00:45:22,140
automatically declare them so we got

00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:25,079
basically three types without doing

00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:26,729
nothing so that's very powerful and a

00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,219
lot of people are talking about you know

00:45:26,729 --> 00:45:32,359
that power of graph kyo-ahn the power

00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:34,380
that you get of basically getting type

00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:43,819
protocol between the client and the

00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:46,619
server so that's good but one thing that

00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:48,630
until I've said until now that's like

00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:52,259
probably you heard in many many others

00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:54,180
brought your lectures and when we go

00:45:52,259 --> 00:45:56,160
about starting to work with big

00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:58,589
companies you know that's how we start

00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:01,559
we start from the client we slowly add

00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:04,589
graph your in and we call the existing

00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:08,069
services that we call before and we get

00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:10,079
you know success pretty fast there but

00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:12,150
the thing is like in any company large

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:12,690
company if you start to be successful

00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,369
fast

00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,769
they're fast people are starting to

00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:19,499
notice and then they want to use those

00:46:16,769 --> 00:46:23,160
things in more and more places now the

00:46:19,499 --> 00:46:25,259
thing is what we talked here is that we

00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:27,959
got a very powerful connection between

00:46:25,259 --> 00:46:30,509
the client and the graph QL engine but

00:46:27,959 --> 00:46:33,660
what about all the backend stuff we are

00:46:30,509 --> 00:46:35,999
still using the same back-end cause we

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,130
used before which is still very powerful

00:46:35,999 --> 00:46:40,890
we've got much you know better two links

00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,860
for that as well but what we started

00:46:40,890 --> 00:46:46,050
thinking is can we get some

00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:47,850
the tools that we have between the

00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:50,700
client and the server thanks to graphic

00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:54,900
oil and applied with same tools and the

00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:57,090
same the same abilities also when we

00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:00,390
call the servers the existing servers we

00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:03,210
don't have control so for example in our

00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:05,880
code here what you saw is that you know

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:07,470
in the resolver code we know what's the

00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,330
input and we know that what's the output

00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,570
then let's say we need to call a

00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:15,930
back-end service to get the data we

00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:17,640
don't know the actual type of the

00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:20,340
backend data because maybe the backend

00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:23,220
data is just a REST API we don't have a

00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:26,160
schema or maybe the schema is updated or

00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:30,240
something like that so we still have

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:31,950
some things that we can improve so what

00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:33,900
we've thought because this is a process

00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:35,850
that we saw happening with a lot of

00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,430
large companies that we work with is

00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:40,890
this would actually help us a lot and

00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:43,530
you know this would actually bring a lot

00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:49,980
of the power of graph QL into more and

00:47:43,530 --> 00:47:51,360
more parts of the organization so so we

00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,880
thought you know so again like we

00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:57,390
thought how can we get some of the power

00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:59,370
in more areas now the thing is some

00:47:57,390 --> 00:48:01,020
people were not the only ones a lot of

00:47:59,370 --> 00:48:03,600
people are looking at that problem and

00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:06,720
they're saying well maybe we can start

00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,030
migrating all the different services

00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:10,920
that we have in organization also into

00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:13,950
graphical services and then we can merge

00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:16,590
them all together and that might be an

00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:18,390
interesting you know approach another

00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:22,500
approach would be to maybe build like

00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:25,140
some small proxies between in front of

00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:27,000
each of those sources and write manually

00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:30,440
their graphical schemas for them and

00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:32,730
then merge them and that's okay but

00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,890
there's a lot of problems with that I

00:48:32,730 --> 00:48:37,050
mean mostly if you're in a real large

00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:42,560
company because when you're working in a

00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:51,600
real large company most likely is that

00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:55,410
the existing API is are not like the

00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:57,090
existing API czar actually it's those

00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:57,370
are resistant teams they're not going to

00:48:57,090 --> 00:48:58,990
just

00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,870
migrate to graphical just like that

00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:03,940
because we decided it's cool you know

00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,950
and maybe it's a lot of legacy code in

00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,770
that legacy code you will never change

00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:11,470
or they have their own tasks so if you

00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:13,660
actually work in a large company those

00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:19,600
solutions are probably not so feasible

00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:21,940
for you so what we instead so I'm saying

00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,890
maybe instead of migrating everything to

00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:27,190
graphical maybe we can use the existing

00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:29,800
services but still get the power of

00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:32,920
graph girl from them like we want to

00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:35,140
have a schema an understanding of what

00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:37,750
those services exposes and we want to be

00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:40,420
able to query those services without

00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:43,000
changing them without needing without us

00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,470
being dependent on them understanding

00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,920
the draft girl is brave now the thing is

00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:52,810
they do have sometimes schema so some of

00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,520
those services maybe they did you some

00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:57,550
other types of schemas like maybe their

00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:00,490
gr PC schemas maybe their sequel

00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:03,400
databases maybe they have open API

00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:05,140
source swagger definitions or maybe

00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,710
they're just you know they don't have

00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:10,120
any schema but they're actually sending

00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:12,460
request and response today so we can

00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,250
just take those responses and try to

00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:19,330
figure out what's the JSON schema out of

00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:21,430
those responses so we thought maybe we

00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,610
can use that data and do something with

00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:23,860
it

00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:26,890
now the thing is we did something

00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:29,320
similar before so I know if you heard

00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:32,440
about a library about that we wrote it's

00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:34,750
called so far what so far is doing is

00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:38,440
that just it's taking your existing

00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:40,800
letter you build a graph QL API what it

00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:44,890
does it takes your graphical API

00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:48,360
introspect sees and generates a REST API

00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:52,000
for you without writing any line of code

00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:54,100
so basically now if you have like let's

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:59,610
say you have one team and they're using

00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:03,880
Russ QL what you can actually do is that

00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:06,310
is that you can generate another open

00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,580
API for other teams that they are not

00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:11,520
buying into this old rascal thing so now

00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,740
you can expose rest

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:17,130
but for you you just maintain one server

00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:19,440
one graphical server but you can expose

00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,119
both graphical and rest so we did

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,040
something similar before and we thought

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:25,590
maybe this time we can do the opposite

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:27,900
way maybe we can take those swagger

00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:31,200
schemas and those G RPC schemas and

00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:34,859
under schema soap schemas maybe we can

00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,960
convert those into graph QL and then

00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:39,390
maybe we couldn't take those individual

00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,660
schemas and merge them into one biggest

00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:46,440
big schema so we found a lot we tried a

00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:50,520
lot and to our surprise it worked and

00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:52,830
this is graphical mesh so graphical mesh

00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:55,050
basically takes a lot of different

00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:58,650
particles and enough from existing

00:51:55,050 --> 00:52:06,330
services and merge them all into one big

00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:09,480
graphical data graph so and what we can

00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:11,430
we can get from this library is that we

00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,880
can get the best out of graphical we can

00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:17,310
get the query language the type safety

00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:19,920
but we don't need to go about and change

00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:22,740
our existing services we can just look

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,020
at what they have and generate graphical

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,810
out of them without them knowing about

00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:29,760
it at all and maybe during the like in

00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:32,280
the protocol itself would be something

00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:35,730
else like gr PCE or rest or something

00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:40,050
but you get the graphical experience on

00:52:35,730 --> 00:52:41,640
the client or on the consumer and yeah

00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:44,750
so like I said the sources can be

00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:48,030
anything they can even be Q systems like

00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:50,130
Kafka or rabbitmq or things like that

00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,339
and we convert those into graphical

00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:57,410
subscriptions so let me show you like a

00:52:53,339 --> 00:53:00,450
small demo I recorded a while back so

00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:03,300
here's and just so you see some code and

00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:06,359
also show you another I have another

00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:10,020
demo that is also pretty cool so what we

00:53:06,359 --> 00:53:13,020
see here is a config file of mesh so in

00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:17,880
that code what we do is all we need to

00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:18,450
do is we define two sources one is a CD

00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,300
source

00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:24,900
it's basically an API that is public I

00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:28,500
have no control of but it

00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:32,400
swagger scheming and the other one is

00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:34,740
weather so it's a weather API again an

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,570
API they have no control on but in that

00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:38,340
case I also have a swagger skimmer so

00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:40,830
I'm lucky

00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:43,290
but those API is never heard about draft

00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:45,450
URL and they're not gonna change for me

00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:51,540
like you can think of them as let's say

00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:55,770
- legacy services in your current in

00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:58,470
your current company so here just by

00:53:55,770 --> 00:54:00,240
defining and match those two sources you

00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:02,100
can ignore the transformations that I

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:05,250
wrote he wrote that there in a second

00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:07,380
just by defining those two and I'll show

00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:10,650
you even you know later on really the

00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:13,700
process from scratch to this point just

00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:17,280
by defining those two what I get now is

00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:19,200
graticule API so just by defining those

00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,440
two and running some code from match

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:28,440
what you see here is that I'm getting to

00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:29,990
query the the city's API and I inquiry

00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:32,700
sorry

00:54:29,990 --> 00:54:35,340
and I'm querying just the fields that I

00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:37,950
need I get out to completion as well

00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:40,470
like let me show you again like all the

00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,330
cool stuff that we always like think

00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:45,630
about graph QL and everything like that

00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:47,610
out of completion validation everything

00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:50,520
like that the full documentation and the

00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:54,270
graphical experience but I didn't write

00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,580
one single line of graphical code and I

00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:57,240
didn't change anything of the underlying

00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,450
services

00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:03,410
I just called match where to call them

00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:06,450
and once they're schema and that's all

00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:08,580
now that's cool but what we actually

00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:11,010
want is we don't just want to find

00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,020
they'll get the series or individually

00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,690
cut the weather we want to build the

00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:19,560
data graph we want to get the weather in

00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:22,200
a city we would theoretically want the

00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,970
band you know in when we allow enough in

00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,430
our company we need to go to the backend

00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:28,650
services and ask them hey can you add an

00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:32,100
endpoint that will bring babies and that

00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:35,250
and we can merge them all now you don't

00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:37,740
need that you can be fine in mesh how

00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:38,760
the connection works and it's by the way

00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,650
fully tied

00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,869
there's a whole lecture I can give about

00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:45,510
that but all those different API is that

00:55:42,869 --> 00:55:47,220
we generated our fully tight and you

00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:49,650
know exactly that when you write it

00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:52,760
connection you know exactly it will tell

00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:56,609
you inside the IDE you make any mistake

00:55:52,760 --> 00:56:00,810
so in just by defining those two now I

00:55:56,609 --> 00:56:04,530
can have a daily forecast field under

00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:10,140
the same API and I can query the daily

00:56:04,530 --> 00:56:12,869
forecast in television and again this is

00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:18,630
from two api's they have no control and

00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:21,780
I can't change them at all now let me

00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:25,260
show you another cool demo that I

00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:27,780
recorded before so I might wanna skip

00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:30,990
here a bit I'm gonna do a bit faster but

00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:35,040
what you see here is surah Asura is a

00:56:30,990 --> 00:56:37,230
famous open source solution in the in

00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,490
the echo system it's basically you get

00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,320
let's say if you have the Postgres

00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:43,770
database you automatically get the graph

00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:46,770
joy the thing is you get a graphical

00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:49,380
yeah juice from your database what I'm

00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:51,540
gonna show you here is that just I'm

00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,090
going to show you from scratch from

00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:59,040
nothing from an empty folder I can

00:56:54,090 --> 00:57:02,250
create a full graphical API just by

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,890
looking at dogs of an API that doesn't

00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:08,760
even have a schema so let's look at it

00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:12,960
I'm creating an empty folder and I'm

00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:17,160
just in it doing yarning it just to

00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,980
initialize the the project now just my

00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:22,320
initial and my project I'm gonna install

00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:28,619
graphical mesh and the JSON schema

00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:30,270
handler of graphical match now I'm going

00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:32,970
to look at the API that I'm going to

00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:35,340
query this is the open brewery's DB so

00:57:32,970 --> 00:57:37,440
it has basically breweries like you know

00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,780
beer places and whiskey places all

00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,350
around the world now it doesn't have a

00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:45,480
schema it just has a dogs website but I

00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:47,190
still want to query them and I have no

00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:50,670
control over them of course and they

00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:52,620
don't have any any graphical api

00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:55,380
whatsoever

00:57:52,620 --> 00:57:59,940
so what I'm gonna do and basically I'm

00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:03,630
gonna just paste in sample Jason's set

00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:05,490
sample inputs and sample outputs of how

00:58:03,630 --> 00:58:11,850
their responses look like so this is

00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:14,130
like a sample a sample response and this

00:58:11,850 --> 00:58:16,560
is the sample inputs I just pasted

00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:18,540
arranged from the docs again but you can

00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:19,080
take it from your own logs or something

00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,410
like that

00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,330
that's all now let's declare match so I

00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:28,640
need to tell matches I need to tell

00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:32,100
match look I have one source the name is

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:34,980
open breweries and what I'm going to

00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:38,610
tell them is I'm gonna say hey you need

00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:41,490
to use you need to use the JSON schema

00:58:38,610 --> 00:58:43,380
handler this is the URL where you're

00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,750
gonna call and those are the sample

00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:50,550
inputs and outlets now just by doing

00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:55,080
that what you're going to see is that

00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:58,320
now I can just run a script you can see

00:58:55,080 --> 00:59:01,470
mesh mesh mesh serve so just by doing

00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:04,800
mesh serve now I have the graphical API

00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:07,620
a graphical gateway into any service

00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:10,710
that I want that's all

00:59:07,620 --> 00:59:12,510
everything you saw here is all you need

00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,640
look at all the documentation that you

00:59:12,510 --> 00:59:18,960
see you can start querying everything

00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:20,180
you basically created a gateway in 30

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,380
seconds

00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:25,770
so that's graphic you'll mention that's

00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:28,470
how powerful it is I can just show you

00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:30,570
the query I'll skip later they Hazar

00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:32,730
apart like the rest part of the video is

00:59:30,570 --> 00:59:35,760
how you connect this API - that's right

00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:37,560
yeah into one graph but I don't think

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,330
you need to see it then if you want to

00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:42,110
see that you can look you can watch my

00:59:39,330 --> 00:59:44,700
talk from the historic ones this year

00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:46,800
demonstrating the whole thing but the

00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:49,050
important part is that that's all you

00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:50,700
need in order to get to declare a

00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:53,910
graphical gateway you don't even need to

00:59:50,700 --> 01:00:00,390
write graphically well let me go back to

00:59:53,910 --> 01:00:03,060
the slides to finish this talk so the

01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:05,310
sources that we that we work with like I

01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,390
showed you an open API and swagger and I

01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,789
show you we can just

01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:10,950
generated from json schema that comes

01:00:08,789 --> 01:00:13,710
from like you know just the data already

01:00:10,950 --> 01:00:16,140
there but you can work with g RPC with

01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:18,510
soap with other graphical services with

01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:20,369
sequel data and by the way goes to old

01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:23,130
data what we've done with all data is we

01:00:20,369 --> 01:00:26,279
took the Microsoft graph it's a old data

01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:29,220
API of all the Microsoft products and we

01:00:26,279 --> 01:00:31,619
generated a graphical API in a minute

01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:34,410
and it works if you can try it out on

01:00:31,619 --> 01:00:36,450
our website and they themselves try to

01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:39,690
have a project where they manually

01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:42,390
created the graph QL API for that API

01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:45,480
two years ago and they failed it didn't

01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:48,779
succeed so don't just show you how

01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:50,819
powerful this thing is now just by

01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:52,349
solving that just really trying to solve

01:00:50,819 --> 01:00:55,019
this very small problem we basically

01:00:52,349 --> 01:00:58,170
created here a very powerful gateway

01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:59,940
that you can just start using today and

01:00:58,170 --> 01:01:01,980
you know a lot of people in the

01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:04,049
community started catching up on it and

01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:05,789
building a lot of cool stuff we did it

01:01:04,049 --> 01:01:07,559
like you can also reach out to us later

01:01:05,789 --> 01:01:11,549
and I can show you more things that

01:01:07,559 --> 01:01:13,559
people build but the cool thing about it

01:01:11,549 --> 01:01:16,289
as well is that you can run it anywhere

01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:18,059
like it can be a gateway and it can you

01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:21,269
know be this big gateway to use but you

01:01:18,059 --> 01:01:24,390
can also generate just an SDK and you

01:01:21,269 --> 01:01:26,160
can use that SDK on your client on a

01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:28,980
machine learning service on another

01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,079
service it's a completely distributed

01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:33,269
mechanism you don't need to have a

01:01:31,079 --> 01:01:35,910
central point of failure or anything

01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:38,549
like that it's powerful ability can run

01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:41,069
anywhere and more than that people from

01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:43,200
the community actually - so that 30

01:01:41,069 --> 01:01:46,920
seconds of video that I showed you

01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:48,420
before and said that's too much so what

01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:50,430
they've done is that they created a

01:01:48,420 --> 01:01:52,650
docker image for mesh that has

01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:56,029
everything configure all you need to

01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:58,859
input into that docker - the docker

01:01:56,029 --> 01:02:01,500
container is the mesh the mesh

01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:04,440
configuration that I showed you and you

01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:07,230
just run it and you get a graphical mesh

01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:11,009
gateway out of the box so that's really

01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:14,039
really cool now just to finish up I

01:02:11,009 --> 01:02:15,990
think this is just the start like you

01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:18,779
saw that I queried for a weather API

01:02:15,990 --> 01:02:19,770
that I didn't have a control of the same

01:02:18,779 --> 01:02:22,619
thing we can do for

01:02:19,770 --> 01:02:24,270
any bank API that exists out there even

01:02:22,619 --> 01:02:26,580
if the bank never heard about growth

01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:27,990
Bureau but then we can even connect the

01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:31,230
weather in the bank we can start

01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:34,050
offering new api's of the weather in the

01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:35,490
branches of a bank and this could be

01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:38,490
completely public and completely

01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:41,510
open-source so now basically all of us

01:02:38,490 --> 01:02:44,580
can start creating new data modules and

01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:49,440
mute data module in a distributed data

01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:51,270
graph and basically expose all the

01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,790
information on the internet for everyone

01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:56,369
to consume for free even if that

01:02:53,790 --> 01:03:01,500
information is not exposing to graphical

01:02:56,369 --> 01:03:03,180
at all so that's the basic path of where

01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:05,460
we're going with graphical match and we

01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:07,050
already have tons of public API is on

01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:10,740
our website so you can just go to the

01:03:07,050 --> 01:03:12,840
website and start playing around so

01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:16,590
that's all for me I'm mostly very

01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:18,600
excited to hear about your questions and

01:03:16,590 --> 01:03:21,720
you know you can go to graphical mesh

01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:23,790
comm or you can just ping us on our web

01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:27,690
site on the guild website on the mesh

01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:29,280
web sites on everywhere and we really

01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:33,750
want to help you can just stop with us

01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:36,720
for free openly on our dis code for just

01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:39,180
reach out we want to see what you're

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,590
going to do with this thing so thank you

01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:53,210
very much and I'm looking forward for

01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:56,430
your questions still see me and hear me

01:03:53,210 --> 01:03:59,910
yes yes sorry I had I had some issues

01:03:56,430 --> 01:04:04,170
with with my Wi-Fi the thing is because

01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:07,140
I change I recently changed house I'm in

01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:12,300
a new house I have no broadband and I

01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:14,760
need to use my phone so I'm a hotspot so

01:04:12,300 --> 01:04:18,000
these zoom call is in its my is running

01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:21,510
on my phone ran out of batteries in the

01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:25,560
middle of the talk I was I was trying to

01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:29,550
join a public Wi-Fi on another computer

01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:32,810
but now I have 5% so I'm gonna run the

01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:36,500
rest in this 5% of batteries

01:04:32,810 --> 01:04:37,700
let's hold all our fingers to make let's

01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,610
see let's see

01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:43,910
but yeah I think we had like some

01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:46,550
questions and I mean there's a there's a

01:04:43,910 --> 01:04:50,090
lot of people that can use what what you

01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:52,340
have shown and it's quite you are quite

01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:56,870
right this is not this is not something

01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:59,480
easy to come by this solution and there

01:04:56,870 --> 01:05:01,730
must be you know few companies already

01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:05,480
looking at it and saying like okay we

01:05:01,730 --> 01:05:08,690
want this how can we get it how can we

01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,200
get it but I saw I saw this there's some

01:05:08,690 --> 01:05:15,950
question let me see if I can recover it

01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:18,830
from the chat I think they were saying I

01:05:15,950 --> 01:05:21,410
I guess they like new to graph quelle

01:05:18,830 --> 01:05:23,390
and they were referring to you know

01:05:21,410 --> 01:05:27,950
looking at the queries that they look

01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:30,320
very much like a JSON and thinking like

01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:32,810
okay so what's the relation between you

01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:36,980
know the query syntax and JSON is that

01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:39,440
is that something has any relation or it

01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:40,880
just that it looks like Jason I mean if

01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,970
you look at the query and also the

01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,240
response if you want to if you want to

01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:51,980
expand on that for some you know for

01:05:47,240 --> 01:05:55,490
someone that it started yeah yeah that's

01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:57,410
a good question so so Jade in Jason

01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:59,750
there's two things Jason here I'm sure

01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:03,230
that the question refers to JSON itself

01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:04,700
is like the data that goes between the

01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:07,970
client and the server let's say or the

01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:10,910
consumer and their provider and there's

01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:12,800
JSON schema which basically is a format

01:06:10,910 --> 01:06:17,480
that makes sure that your data that you

01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:20,210
send this is in a certain format so what

01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:22,220
we in graph QL you can actually send any

01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:24,980
data over the wire and the most common

01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:27,140
thing is direction to send JSON so when

01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:29,120
you saw on sending a request the query

01:06:27,140 --> 01:06:35,180
in the graphical language what I'm going

01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:39,230
to get back is JSON but unlike but

01:06:35,180 --> 01:06:42,290
unlike descending JSON response letting

01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:44,960
it with REST API because I'm sending a

01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:46,589
query I can decide what I'm going to get

01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:48,479
back so

01:06:46,589 --> 01:06:51,869
if you use JSON schema before for

01:06:48,479 --> 01:06:55,049
example you can think about it as the

01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:58,349
client can query what parts of JSON

01:06:55,049 --> 01:07:01,140
schema they need and that's a very

01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:03,479
powerful ability also for a get a client

01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:06,059
to get a very just the things that they

01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:07,859
need and be more efficient but also on

01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:10,619
the server when you know what your

01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:13,410
clients want you can react in and match

01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:17,579
that away and you can respond in a much

01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:20,369
more efficient way so yeah if you looked

01:07:17,579 --> 01:07:21,839
at JSON and JSON schema I think you it

01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:23,400
will be really cool for you to try a

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:25,400
graphical and actually with graphical

01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:28,529
match you can take let's say you have a

01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:30,960
JSON schema right now you can take your

01:07:28,529 --> 01:07:33,479
existing JSON schema and with graphical

01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:36,690
mesh generate the graphical schema from

01:07:33,479 --> 01:07:38,999
it so then you don't need to change your

01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:40,799
existing server but you can start

01:07:38,999 --> 01:07:42,989
clearing graphical and you can start you

01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,640
know hacking around and see what's the

01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:47,489
difference and you can get some of the

01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:49,049
benefits without doing a lot of work and

01:07:47,489 --> 01:07:55,049
without learning too much just

01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:56,849
automatically migrating so cool

01:07:55,049 --> 01:08:00,509
cool thanks thanks for answering that

01:07:56,849 --> 01:08:03,989
and we have another another question

01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:06,289
here so let me really doubt for you for

01:08:03,989 --> 01:08:09,779
everyone the best mesh provides

01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:14,219
subscriptions out-of-the-box if so what

01:08:09,779 --> 01:08:16,889
is the transport in that case that's a

01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:20,639
good question so let's so first of all

01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:23,369
baby of mesh is that we take your

01:08:20,639 --> 01:08:25,199
existing sources so when you say

01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:28,489
subscriptions out-of-the-box what

01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:31,589
gradual subscriptions is basically a

01:08:28,489 --> 01:08:33,900
sophisticated pub/sub mechanism so it

01:08:31,589 --> 01:08:36,509
needs an event system to listen to and

01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:39,179
then every time there is an event it

01:08:36,509 --> 01:08:40,679
will ask for a certain query together

01:08:39,179 --> 01:08:43,710
with the event path difference between

01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:46,619
that's a regular pub/sub and graphical

01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:48,060
subscriptions what graffia so that if

01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:50,819
you would just build graphical

01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:52,880
subscriptions from by hand then you

01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:56,699
would just need to listen to some event

01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:59,210
now the question is what kind of events

01:08:56,699 --> 01:09:00,419
do you have today that are existing

01:08:59,210 --> 01:09:02,189
already

01:09:00,419 --> 01:09:03,479
so let's say if you already have an

01:09:02,189 --> 01:09:07,049
event system let's say you have the

01:09:03,479 --> 01:09:09,569
Koshka mechanism or you have or you just

01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:11,909
listen to triggers from the database or

01:09:09,569 --> 01:09:14,329
anything like that with graphical mash

01:09:11,909 --> 01:09:18,299
you can paint those existing systems and

01:09:14,329 --> 01:09:20,219
you can basically create graphical mesh

01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:23,249
out of them graphical match what we'll

01:09:20,219 --> 01:09:25,649
do for the consumer it would look like

01:09:23,249 --> 01:09:29,309
graphical subscriptions but over the

01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:31,679
wire it will be as it was before so over

01:09:29,309 --> 01:09:35,130
the wire if you let's say the message

01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:38,009
was running through let's say the

01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:41,189
message was running through Kafka then

01:09:38,009 --> 01:09:43,739
you would just listen through Kafka and

01:09:41,189 --> 01:09:46,019
get the message now the difference with

01:09:43,739 --> 01:09:47,809
Kafka is that now with graphical

01:09:46,019 --> 01:09:51,749
subscriptions you can also get a query

01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:54,229
so let's say you're listening to a cafe

01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:57,419
event but then you want to query also

01:09:54,229 --> 01:09:59,689
some data from that event but also an

01:09:57,419 --> 01:10:03,539
other data from other sources like your

01:09:59,689 --> 01:10:05,669
sequel database or another API now

01:10:03,539 --> 01:10:08,399
graphical mesh will abstract that for

01:10:05,669 --> 01:10:12,780
you so you will fire it will fire the

01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:14,820
Kafka stream into the consumer whatever

01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:18,530
the consumer is it might be a gateway it

01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:22,709
might be another time and then graphical

01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:25,380
mesh will call the database or will call

01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:28,499
the other rats rest service let's say

01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:31,019
get the data and present you the results

01:10:28,499 --> 01:10:33,689
now for you as the consumer of graphical

01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:35,909
mesh this is all abstracted away from

01:10:33,689 --> 01:10:38,039
you you just subscribe to a certain

01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:40,939
event and you get the full response

01:10:38,039 --> 01:10:43,499
every time the develop ends you are

01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:48,449
everything else is taken care of by

01:10:43,499 --> 01:10:51,570
graphical mesh for you so in that

01:10:48,449 --> 01:10:53,909
context basically graphical mesh works

01:10:51,570 --> 01:10:56,340
on your existing sources that's the idea

01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:57,780
of graphical match you can also build

01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:59,939
your own graphical subscription

01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:01,679
mechanisms and then for example will be

01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:03,959
in the client and the server and then if

01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:08,039
you build it you have your own choice of

01:11:03,959 --> 01:11:11,639
the transport the transport can be web

01:11:08,039 --> 01:11:14,210
sockets can be MQTT basically the

01:11:11,639 --> 01:11:17,000
graphical subscription spec doesn't

01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:23,270
whatever transport using zooms whatever

01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:26,240
transport you one cool we have another

01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:30,230
one and this is also quite interesting

01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:33,190
so let me just speak it out how can you

01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:37,930
provide more extensive validations on

01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:42,020
models like for example keeping or

01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:45,470
expressing like a maximum characters for

01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:48,530
a string like he's mentioning or she's

01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:50,930
mentioning 200 characters so imagine we

01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:56,050
have we have a field and we want to

01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:56,050
express that at wrist strain on that

01:11:56,080 --> 01:12:03,080
question so graph you by default has

01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:05,540
certain types of scholars so then if I

01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,970
define the return value of each field

01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:10,670
each field wasn't is of a type let's say

01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:13,070
int then it will have to be an integer

01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:16,190
it won't be able to be out of like a

01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:19,370
float or it couldn't be a string so

01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:21,650
those are the basic things but in graph

01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:24,020
coil you can actually be find custom

01:12:21,650 --> 01:12:25,760
scholars and we have if you google

01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:28,520
graphical scholars we are actually

01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:30,230
maintaining the NPM library graph those

01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:32,930
colors we changed a lot of other

01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:36,500
different customs colors that we already

01:12:32,930 --> 01:12:40,070
created for you for example a bank I

01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:42,020
bend number an email address the URL all

01:12:40,070 --> 01:12:45,460
kinds of things like that that it will

01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:48,530
have that has the validation for you if

01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:50,540
you have a custom color that is color

01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:53,600
that is different from that you can

01:12:50,540 --> 01:12:55,400
develop your own scholars but you could

01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,230
it's worth looking at the graphical

01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,360
stellaris library just to see how it's

01:12:57,230 --> 01:13:01,520
done and then you can just you know

01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:05,960
configure your own new custom scholars

01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:08,470
to do their whatever value page very

01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:11,060
good and there's another question

01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:15,440
there's some questions popping popping

01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:19,100
out as we talk and yeah so this one is

01:13:15,440 --> 01:13:21,290
okay the is there any like basic like

01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:22,960
introductory course that you can

01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:28,750
recommend on

01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:31,870
you know graphic well and also okay so

01:13:28,750 --> 01:13:34,960
for someone that just started to do

01:13:31,870 --> 01:13:41,710
graphic well and has has been doing

01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:45,880
JavaScript and Maron stack but I guess

01:13:41,710 --> 01:13:49,510
yes so general to graphic well yeah so I

01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:53,440
think first of all graphical dot org is

01:13:49,510 --> 01:13:56,470
actually a very very nice website and I

01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:58,720
would actually start there we are also

01:13:56,470 --> 01:14:01,360
working now on making the website you

01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:05,920
know even a bit better but I think it's

01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:07,750
a good it's a good start so I would

01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:11,590
really recommend graphical tutorial also

01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:14,380
write it here but also that what we

01:14:11,590 --> 01:14:16,330
build was we peel the editorial that is

01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:19,300
like it's called the word subclone we

01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:21,040
basically will build the Watsa app from

01:14:19,300 --> 01:14:24,100
scratch including the front end and the

01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:26,860
back end and it uses graphic UL and the

01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:30,640
database and we act on the front-end and

01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:35,760
things like that so I would also

01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:39,430
recommend that so I'll paste here a link

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:41,080
to the tutorial and also in that

01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:46,660
tutorial if you have issues or something

01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:48,910
like that you can just yeah also thanks

01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:51,250
thanks for sharing that and I think we

01:14:48,910 --> 01:14:56,230
have the last the last question if none

01:14:51,250 --> 01:15:00,040
none other questions pop up so does mesh

01:14:56,230 --> 01:15:02,650
provide filters or queries on parent

01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:07,630
elements using child properties in a

01:15:02,650 --> 01:15:11,949
predicate for example all users that

01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:17,389
contain a message with the world hi

01:15:11,949 --> 01:15:20,810
mm good question so not out of the box

01:15:17,389 --> 01:15:24,790
but what we building match is that you

01:15:20,810 --> 01:15:30,139
have you have custom transforms

01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:32,150
throughout the way meaning that means

01:15:30,139 --> 01:15:35,360
that it first of all from let's say if

01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:37,040
you have some kind of schema doesn't

01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,730
matter even if it's a custom schema that

01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:43,250
you invented in your company that then

01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:44,989
gives you that it gives you those

01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:48,290
definitions you can write your own

01:15:44,989 --> 01:15:50,869
transforms that will debt and will

01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:53,750
generate a J's a graphical schema with

01:15:50,869 --> 01:15:56,270
that information of what you want to

01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:58,340
validate that costume thing you can add

01:15:56,270 --> 01:16:00,500
it let's say as allocations on the

01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:04,219
scheme or something like that but then

01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:06,949
we also provide transforms when the

01:16:04,219 --> 01:16:10,100
requests are passing so you can also

01:16:06,949 --> 01:16:11,869
then build a custom transforms that look

01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:13,969
at the schema that you repeat that has

01:16:11,869 --> 01:16:17,480
been generated look at the rules and

01:16:13,969 --> 01:16:20,989
validate those as well I'm not sure if

01:16:17,480 --> 01:16:23,270
it's answering exactly our question if

01:16:20,989 --> 01:16:26,900
not you can write it here or I can try

01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:32,060
then or you can write it on the repo and

01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:34,790
loop it but but basically B is that

01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:37,820
every step of the way is custom because

01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:40,400
what we have so is that really in a lot

01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:43,190
of large companies like it's not like

01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:45,050
you can get one transform or one

01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:46,940
converter to work for everyone there are

01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:49,850
so many custom rules and there's so many

01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:53,150
custom protocol so we deliberately made

01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:54,860
it like very customizable it will be

01:16:53,150 --> 01:17:00,020
cool to look at your use case and see if

01:16:54,860 --> 01:17:01,699
we can't read it okay so I I did I did

01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:04,070
share you know the links that you share

01:17:01,699 --> 01:17:07,820
before you share to the panelists

01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:10,429
so I share to the others just quickly so

01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:12,050
they they have the links now and I think

01:17:10,429 --> 01:17:15,290
there's another there's another question

01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:18,860
this time from Adam owes from the you

01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:21,110
know part of the panelist and he's

01:17:18,860 --> 01:17:23,560
asking if there are any plans to have

01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:26,720
tutorial using blazer

01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:29,210
good question we currently don't work

01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:31,700
with blazer but if you do work with that

01:17:29,210 --> 01:17:35,420
we can actually collaborate and help you

01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:38,600
with that we do work with Microsoft by

01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:40,850
the way so would it be interesting to

01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:42,620
look at it so if you are interested in

01:17:40,850 --> 01:17:47,450
that and you want to play around and you

01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:49,100
need some help we will by the way we in

01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:51,380
the gradual code generator for example

01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:53,200
generates code like dotnet code both

01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:55,820
from the back end and the front end so

01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:58,060
we can play around and I used to be a

01:17:55,820 --> 01:18:04,820
document developer couple years ago so I

01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:06,610
didn't write plays or actually I think

01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:11,060
that's the last that's the last question

01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:14,420
so maybe maybe we can we can get it a

01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:17,690
little bit out of the Q&A and I'm going

01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:22,190
to I'm going to start my own Q&A so my

01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:26,060
own Q&A is mostly interested in how did

01:18:22,190 --> 01:18:29,390
you span you know the time that we that

01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:32,840
we were mostly at home like you did any

01:18:29,390 --> 01:18:36,110
anything different like you change your

01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:39,740
routine maybe use that time to learn

01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:43,120
something new I I know that many many

01:18:39,740 --> 01:18:46,430
people did like something different

01:18:43,120 --> 01:18:49,940
myself I started writing because I

01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:52,220
wanted to get out of the house and I'm

01:18:49,940 --> 01:18:54,890
just wondering what did you do what did

01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:59,150
you did anything different or how was

01:18:54,890 --> 01:19:02,540
helpful for you so in the guild we all

01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:08,180
wrote remote work remotely so it wasn't

01:19:02,540 --> 01:19:10,610
so different but one but it was a bit so

01:19:08,180 --> 01:19:12,800
I one thing that I've done is I started

01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:15,530
doing more sports at home which was

01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,690
really fun but then actually I followed

01:19:15,530 --> 01:19:20,990
you and you're running so if you post it

01:19:17,690 --> 01:19:23,270
every day like crazy runs I need to

01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:25,160
start running again so you actually

01:19:23,270 --> 01:19:27,290
inspired me to start running again and I

01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:29,360
started like basically a month and a

01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:32,080
half ago to start writing again not not

01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:36,170
as much as you but I'm working oh yeah

01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:36,990
thanks for inspiring me oh yeah no I

01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:38,940
don't become

01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:42,660
and that actually that's that's a little

01:19:38,940 --> 01:19:45,480
bit too much but the thing is I was

01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:48,150
thinking I don't want to be at home I

01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:52,260
mean as as you do you do travel a lot

01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:55,020
and and you then you are being put into

01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:57,870
your house and you can I mean we didn't

01:19:55,020 --> 01:20:00,870
know how long it would take so I wanted

01:19:57,870 --> 01:20:04,050
to do something outside of the house so

01:20:00,870 --> 01:20:06,900
that that that was mainly the the goal

01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:09,210
but then of course I got a little bit

01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:12,540
over myself and then did something that

01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:14,870
I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah no I

01:20:12,540 --> 01:20:17,430
don't recommend that running every day

01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:20,280
for a hundred days it's just too much

01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:22,770
but yeah just going for a run like - a

01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:23,460
couple of times a week I think it's

01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:25,710
perfect

01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:28,500
I think you would anyone can enjoy that

01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:33,240
even though a walk doesn't need to be a

01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:35,820
run but yeah well I I think we recovered

01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:38,880
everything I think we are on time as

01:20:35,820 --> 01:20:43,020
well that was I mean that was an amazing

01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:45,780
an amazing talk I I would love to have

01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:48,390
you know the type of his life that you

01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:51,420
share of him how long did it take you to

01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:54,660
do these slides my god these are very

01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:58,110
beautiful slides and this there's only

01:20:54,660 --> 01:21:02,580
one thing I want to mention and he's you

01:20:58,110 --> 01:21:06,300
