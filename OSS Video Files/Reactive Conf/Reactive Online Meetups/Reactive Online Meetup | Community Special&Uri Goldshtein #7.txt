TALK
GraphQL Mesh – Why GraphQL between services is the worst idea and the best idea at the same time!

TALK ABSTRACT
We all heard about the benefits of using GraphQL between the client and server, but when it comes to communication between services on the backend there is still a lot of discussions about different philosophies and solutions. Should you use Federation, Stitching, or not use GraphQL at all? In this talk, I’m going to demonstrate each approach, show the downsides of each of them, and reveal a new, radical approach that brings the best of all worlds.

BIO
Long time open source veteran. Started The Guild to create a sustainable way of building and maintaining open source. A big believer in GraphQL. Worked in Apollo, collaborated with Facebook on the GraphQL Subscriptions spec, and create many famous open source libraries.
