Stay home. Stay safe. And, stay connected to the community.
We realize our meetups and gatherings were not just about the high-quality content talks but mostly about the post networking and discussions you could lead with like-minded developers. We are planning on keeping the Slack channel for communication about all of our following online meetups, your one on one communication, and hope it will be the meeting point of our online community.
