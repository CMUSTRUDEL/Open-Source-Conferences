Connecting optional data into strongly typed components using TS
𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧 
Typescript is very useful when it comes to developer confidence and speed of development if done right. We started adopting Typescript in our codebase and encountered a problem where data from the Redux state might be potentially undefined. There were multiple ways how to resolve this. One option was to override the type and enforce it when returned from Redux. We have decided to solve the problem more generically. We will take a look at the advantages and drawbacks of a few solutions including our chosen one.

Jakub has a wide variety of skills. He transitioned from backend technologies to frontend and started a game studio in the meanwhile. He believes Typescript will be the number one language in upcoming years for web

Fast & Furious - Going headless with Nuxt.js!
𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
This will be fast & furious! I will show you the fastest possible way to connect your Nuxt.js (Vue.js) project to the headless CMS and deploy it in seconds. You should know a thing or two about Nuxt.js, headless CMS in general or JAMstack as there will be no time to describe the concepts in detail. In the end, you will be furious at how insanely good the JAMstack is!
A sneak peek into the future headless eCommerce
Join us as we look into our crystal ball and predict the future! Jamstack brought us decoupled (not dystopian)) architecture. This new wave of SaaS products and services is here to stay. The advantages are clear:
- better UX
- better DX
- faster websites
- more effective development
- previews with real-time editing experience
- no need to know everything
- we can focus!
It’s clear that the industry will see continued growth in Jamstack & headless. Join me to learn how to take advantage of these technologies to build an eCommerce solution with Nuxt, Vue Storefront, BigCommerce and Storyblok, the headless CMS.

Stay home. Stay safe. And, stay connected to the community.
We realize our meetups and gatherings were not just about the high-quality content talks but mostly about the post networking and discussions you could lead with like-minded developers. We are planning on keeping the Slack channel for communication about all of our following online meetups, your one on one communication, and hope it will be the meeting point of our online community.

we will try to broaden your views

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,359
regarding the frontend skills with

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,519
two talks firstly jakub kopshiwa

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,000
will talk about connecting optional data

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,200
into strongly typed components using

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,960
typescript

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,160
and our main dev talk will be by samuel

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,719
snopko

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,200

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,239
uh

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,360
going headless with next js

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,320
just just to introduce myself my name is

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,239
andy

and i'm from vacuum labs which is a

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,920
company that stays behind the original

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
reactive conf

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,760
back in 2015. vacuum labs focuses

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,440
on providing flexible and reliable

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,080
software engineers to clients

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,720
all over the world and help them build

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,080
various

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,000
fintech or blockchain projects and

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,520
products other than that

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,200
we can probably start so let's welcome

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,040
our first speaker

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,799
jakub how are you doing are you here

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:28,479
hey guys hey uh i'm doing 12

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,439
so i think we can just jump into it and

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,400
start with

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,880
the first talk yeah so stage is yours

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,360
please

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
share your screen and we can start

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,240
all right folks

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,360
screen seems to be started so without

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:55,840
further ado

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,840
let me start the presentation

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,439
[Music]

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
now you are not wrong here my name is

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,239
jacob

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,760
and this was an introduction because the

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,920
whole presentation gonna be

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,680
like in the star wars team uh i'm big

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,800
star wars fan so

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
welcome again and i'll tell you a story

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
about

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,599
how we actually started updating

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,440
typescript in our javascript code base

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,319
and with like few weeks

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,319
within a few weeks we actually

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,519
encountered the first problem

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,840
and that was actually about how to

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,280
strictly type our components

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,640
and get the data to the redux

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,200
uh in order to basically understand

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,640
our problem or what we were facing or

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,200
what you might be facing

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,599
in the application let's demonstrate it

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,720
on a very simple application

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,200
from the star wars theme imagine that we

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,480
have

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,599
simple application that is able to

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,640
somehow render that

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,959
our character from star wars as uh

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,000
over here the luke skywalker is coming

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,200
from a planet

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,599
called tattooine in order to do so we

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,959
will need some kind of data structure

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,920
which is usually in database reference

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,519
and represented by some kind of entities

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,680
where we have a planet entity

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,720
which has some kind of unique identifier

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,599
and the name of it

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,239
so this would be a tattoo in here and a

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:32,159
character

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,360
so as well we will have some kind of

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,080
unique identifier

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
and also the name of the character and

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,239
there is some kind of relation between

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,440
them

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,080
over here we say that

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
character can have only one planet as a

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
home planet

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,400
but one planet can host multiple

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,440
characters

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,200
this is done usually by referencing the

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,000
unique identifier on the character

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,879
entity

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,720
so we will be referencing the id how it

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,760
will look like an adjacent structure

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,080
is basically that the character

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
which is over here will have some kind

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,480
of reference

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,200
and the id will be its property

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,239
and we can find somewhere else in

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,000
database or

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:19,040
in a redirect state that this entity

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,840
is over here referenced by this id and

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,000
its name

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,759
is actually tatwin so by the reference

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
we are able to retrieve some properties

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,320
of the entity

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,320
in order to render in our sample

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,360
application some data we will also need

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,520
some components

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,600
let's say we will have a character

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,240
representing the luke skywalker here

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,680
and also a planet representing the

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,080
planet name

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
and as you can see this will not work

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,440
out of the box

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:50,240
without connection over the redux

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,440
so we are referencing all data only by

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,479
passing the id

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,600
over here and let the connect function

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,720
to do the work

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,680
and retrieve the name of the planet from

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,199
the

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:06,400
state somehow the way how it is done

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,800
is actually by some kind of selectors we

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
can

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,240
use reselect or actually redux toolkit

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,400
has the reselect bundled inside so

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,560
this works basically that we will pass

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,680
the id to the selector

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,960
it will find the planet

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,840
by the id and from that entity it will

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,080
get us the

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,280
the property so basically just by

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,840
passing the id

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,800
we can find the entire entity and its

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,960
properties

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,800
it's very convenient because we are able

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,320
to retrieve whatever data

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,600
is very flexible so for future if you

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,639
want to display

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
somehow differently the name of the of

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,919
the planet

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,720
based on its type or something like that

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:53,440
we are able to do it easily

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,160
but the problem begins over here when we

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,919
start to

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,600
typing the connect function into

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,479
typescript and

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,680
we will get sooner or later into error

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,160
which is

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,720
to be honest not very readable so let's

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,319
help ourselves and

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,319
i'll explain a little bit what it

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,120
actually means

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,039
over here we can see that undefined is

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,880
actually not assignable to

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,120
like type string where the string

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
is coming from our map state to props

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,560
interface

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,919
which we need to pass into the component

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,400
itself

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,919
but the string can unfind is coming from

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,680
the get planet name

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,680
how this can happen when we have the

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,720
reference by id it's actually

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,400
not possible to satisfy this via

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,520
typescript that we are passing a correct

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,319
or wallet id

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,360
imagine that you will send a invalid id

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,800
over there

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,520
and in this case none entity will be

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,440
found

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,039
so this will result in undefined value

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,560
what can be the solutions for this

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,479
problem well

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,599
there is one which is an easy fix but

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:08,240
uh not very suitable for all types

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,479
on all values because let's be honest

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,599
like what is the

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,000
default value of any planet in the

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,720
star wars universe there is none right

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,639
so

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,960
we can use the default fallback like

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,520
this it will basically like satisfy the

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,599
types

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
but we are screwed because we don't know

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,080
about it so

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,720
we have no potential potential lock over

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
a

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,800
and we don't actually know that the

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,080
application is somehow broken

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,199
and it shouldn't be the second option

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,880
is always make the component

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,120
properties optional but in this case

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,199
we will end up in defining all the

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,560
properties optional

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,960
and what is even like wars

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,879
that the component is actually not

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,240
strongly typed because we will end up

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,840
with all the optional properties

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,879
and we will need to handle them

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,039
correctly at each single point

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,720
so this wasn't actually a valid solution

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,840
for us as well

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
so we think a little bit more and we

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,639
were actually thinking

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:18,000
that we will force the types to be

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,479
to be present there so you can satisfy

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,039
it

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,319
either in selector or connect and

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,520
basically say

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,639
i as developer and in charge of the

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,520
types here

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,319
and uh i'm pretty sure that the planet

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,440
gonna be there

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,039
but to be honest we are lying ourselves

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,599
and sooner or later this will bring

00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,800
application crash and will make our

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,560
users angry

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,560
and our time uh over debugging this

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,920
will uh will be like uh not well spent

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,480
the error in the like nice case

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
where we have some developer developer

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,360
playground

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,519
gonna be something meaningful like this

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
or this but in the production

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,680
application it will just crush the

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,279
application

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,600
and the user will end up with a blank

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,720
screen

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,760
here it comes to our solution which we

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
came up with

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,040
and in order to understand it we will

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,120
need to know

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,399
a little bit about typescript and what

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
the typeguard is

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,320
imagine that you have basically two very

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,440
similar types

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,160
and those types are different only by

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,160
the

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,360
by some fields so let's say orders and

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,880
email

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,680
and we have a function that can return

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,560
a general user and the user let's say

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
alice is

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,800
our customer and bob is our admin and we

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,480
need to show

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:47,279
and somehow differentiate in a code

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,959
what bob or alice is actually from the

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,360
type definition

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
in order to do so we can use this type

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,160
guard which is basically

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,279
only a function which says to us and to

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,760
typescript

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,480
that the user which is passed here as

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,200
argument

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
is actually admin or customer and we are

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,720
able to safely

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,120
touch the email field or the orders

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,600
field here

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,160
here we go into the solution we came up

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,839
with

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,600
it's uh super simple and in simplicity

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:22,720
is the is the beauty right so the

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,320
first arguments are basically completely

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
the same interface as the connect

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,959
function

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,320
we are just passing the same arguments

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,160
into the connect

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,399
but we are wrapping our component with a

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,800
new high order component

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,920
which is actually receiving few more

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,519
arguments the first one is the component

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
as we are used to from the standard

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,360
connect functions from redux

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,399
the second one is mandatory and is a

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,720
type guard so

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,480
this type guard actually tell us whether

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,959
the props that has been passed into the

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,640
component are valid for the component

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,279
and we have also some kind of error

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,320
component which we will display instead

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,440
in case the props are not satisfied as

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,680
you can see here

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,959
that in case the type guard is not

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,000
actually satisfied

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:12,880
we are able to create some kind of error

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,160
log it and over here i don't mean like

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,480
console error locate

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,440
but you can with the redux tank for

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,600
example pass it into your

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
application logs or send tray or

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
whatever

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
and we are rendering our error component

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,959
it can be null

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,640
it can be whatever error we can display

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,079
to the user so he can actually

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,000
understand that there's something wrong

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,079
we are working on fixing it

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,920
and he doesn't need to worry about and

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:41,120
refresh the application like hell

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,600
to to fix it from his side so

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,680
it is like nice for the user behavior

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,720
uh as a real life example how this is

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:53,360
used we can see that the partial connect

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
hasn't actually been changed except that

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,360
we are using

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:00,240
different name of the function and

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,480
in the final definition or in the final

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,839
return function we are passing the type

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
guard

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,880
which defines whether the name of the

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,800
planet is actually there

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,360
what will happen in a state where we

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,160
can or we want to display three

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,560
characters

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,360
and as you can see over here our darth

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,839
vader

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,519
doesn't have a planet because he is

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
referenced by

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,959
or his home planet is referenced by id

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:32,160
which doesn't exist in our store

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:34,880
we all rendered it now there and

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,279
what is the most critical thing here we

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,399
will

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,120
know about it because our sentry can

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
accept or will know about it in the in

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
the logs

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,160
so we have very nice error that the

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,959
planet cannot be rendered

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,040
because the probe types doesn't match

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:53,839
and the props that has been passed there

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,880
are the existing ide but not an existing

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
name so we are

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,200
way closer to debugging the only

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,880
disadvantage of this approach is that

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,760
it's actually not automated

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,519
we don't have any kind of like run time

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,760
type checks

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:12,399
but in future we are looking into it

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
to automate it and don't even need to

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,200
write

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,240
the single type guard for the components

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,560
that's actually it for me and

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,360
currently we are thinking about open

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
sourcing

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,760
the solution so check out

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,560
our and follow our twitter accounts uh

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,519
mine and newsdevs and also check the

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,279
blog

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,800
where we will write about it and there

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,720
will be for sure

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,320
some kind of cookbook when we announce

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
it publicly

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,760
thank you very much for your attention

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,560
and now i guess

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:52,000
there is uh some time for your questions

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,120
absolutely correct uh thank you for your

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,160
talk

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,600
uh i

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,199
will check whether there are some

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,600
questions and

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:07,199
as i see there is there is one

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,639
uh from marcel why not just show loader

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,480
and initiate request

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:16,079
server it's actually

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:19,360
definitely possible

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:22,560
uh one thing on the other hand is

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,639
that what if the

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,680
structure and database is actually

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
actually broken

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,079
so you will have some kind of reference

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,760
even in the database and the problem

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,519
doesn't need to be on front-end side so

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,519
you will basically crash the application

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,639
because the backend is incorrect

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,600
uh in this case you can render some kind

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,160
of like error

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,519
hey there is an error and we are working

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,000
on fixing it

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,680
so you will be able to track it down and

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,680
even fix the data in the database

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:58,160
sure uh the the seems

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,959
quite natural i would probably just add

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,920
that

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:03,120
maybe in some cases for example when

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,800
there is a lot of data

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,560
you do not want to have everything

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,839
loaded beforehand

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,480
so probably your id is just absolutely

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,560
enough

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,800
and then you can check your redux state

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
is is the data already there if not then

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,160
i will try to load it

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:23,440
etc uh and that probably can be

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,560
solved by that higher order component uh

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,680
with some x some extended version of it

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,160
uh for sure as well yeah definitely like

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,600
marcel is also proposing that we can use

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,800
error boundary for this one

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
and that's also correct but in this case

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,199
like

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,880
uh it just brings you a little bit

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,839
closer to debugging

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,480
so basically you will know a little bit

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,800
a little bit

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,800
closer where the problem lies

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,320
uh yes and to be honest the error

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,600
boundaries uh

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,440
they can be also put into uh

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,360
some higher order component and you can

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,160
wrap every component with an error

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,839
boundary

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,800
but i found that quite impractical uh

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,480
yeah but but it can be solved in a

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,120
really similar fashion with their air

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,120
boundary as well

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,519
yeah so that's all from the q a

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,560
thank you jacob and now we will move to

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,920
our second talk by samuel thank you very

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,800

hi everybody i'm samuel and i will be

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,920
talking usually fast and furious but

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,679
today i have a little bit more time so

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,640
it will be not so fast and furious and

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,480
we will

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,480
be talking or i will be talking about

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,880
going headless with nexus

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,640
or as it correctly it should be written

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,480
on just the next

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,720
is the name of the framework built on

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,959
the view which is also like if you are

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,280
not familiar with the next then it's uh

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,439
very similar to the next uh js from the

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,640
react and the varsalty

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,280
so my name is uh simon snoko

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,080
am i currently working as a head of the

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,840
relationship

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,440
or basically responsible for developer

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,160
relationship with storyblock

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,039
i was uh working a long time ago not a

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,280
long time ago

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,760
for some time as a frontend knight or

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,960
like basically creating all that

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,080
various uh fancy front ends for various

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
companies and

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,559
they all wanted to have it very fancy so

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
basically i ended up as

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,880
a design ops a bridge between these

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,440
developers and the designers and then i

00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,840
looked

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,799
for some frameworks and i didn't choose

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,640
a react board

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,880
and uh next yes but i went for the next

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
and then also later i was looking for a

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,200
better cms like the option

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,160
how to handle my data because i wasn't

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,320
happy with all the

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
traditional cmss i was using that them

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:18,240
and then i found out the story block

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,840
and so and that was like three years ago

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,120
and somehow the last day i joined the

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,960
company

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,720
in the meantime i'm also like speaker

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,200
and community believer so basically

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,039
helping

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,200
uh to create some uh other meetups and

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,280
also like talk on different stuff

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,480
uh i don't have a lot of slides so

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,480
basically this is

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,160
almost like this last slide i have so we

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,880
will be doing some live coding

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,720
and what we will doing today is uh you

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,960
can see the final stage

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,400
at uh storyblock slash talk placing the

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,080
fast neck just

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,480
and basically we are going to create

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,960
from scratch an x.js application

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,600
which will be a deployment ready i would

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,520
say

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,679
and connect it to the headless cms in

00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,960
this case storyblock as you can guess

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,440
and uh i will try to do it in under 30

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,400
minutes

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,000
so how you should start if you are like

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,640
like totally new with uh

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,720
with uh next is that the easiest and the

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,200
fastest way basically to start with next

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,880
it just like create uh use the next app

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,720
which is provided by the next team

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,480
it's a awesome thing that you don't have

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,799
to do anything else just basically go

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,440
for yarn create next up a blazingly fast

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,360
showcase so the blazing fashion is here

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,919
of course the name of the project

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,280
then it uh get you to the guide where

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,320
you will set up your project

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,919
and you can choose from many uh many

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
options i am going for javascript in

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,880
this case

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,640
uh still keeping uh with the arm even

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,080
the 9 p.m it's the last time i heard

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,000
this a little bit faster

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,440
i'm usually using italian css at the

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,120
moment i like it a lot

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,720
i can encourage you to try it if you

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,600
didn't try it and didn't have a chance

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,080
still

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,640
in this case minute may i jump in if you

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,520
are

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,320
if you are changing your slice uh it's

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,200
not appearing

00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,320
at least not on on my screen so it

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,080
probably froze or it may be the case

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,559
so what do you what do you see that

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,520
right now which which i see slide with

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,120
the live coding

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,960
and uh okay arm emoji okay cool

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,480
so uh give me two minutes i will

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,559
reconnect i have just to stop

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,640
my zoom and i will be connecting that in

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,600
a like a few seconds

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
so the start you didn't see is basically

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,440
i

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,000
created my uh my next application by

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,679
using the next app so it's a yarn create

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,320
next app and then you just add your

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,679
basically your name of your project at

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,960
this moment it will set up your project

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,720
where i choose the name

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
i choose javascript as the programming

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,120
language at the moment you could go also

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,559
type script uh it's easier a little bit

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,200
faster for me to go for javascript at

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,520
the moment

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,760
the package manager i choose the yarn i

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,000
went for the tailwind css there is like

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,120
option like 12 different uh ui

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,480
frameworks you can use

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,559
and at the moment i'm choosing the

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
nakja's module so i'm good i'm not going

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
to choose any of these

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,640
even you could use sometimes axios or

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,559
like even the tva etc

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
so uh the linking tools is also like

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,000
preseason by the next team

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
but i'm not going to choose any of them

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,559
at the moment and not doing the testing

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
for the talk

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,400
uh we will be doing uh server side

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,559
rendering or server-side generated

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
app and more at the end of the day it's

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,440
up to you how you will basically deploy

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,520
your project but

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,120
i would go for definitely yours

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,280
universal application

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,960
and then uh as uh the deployment i would

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,600
go for some something like versal

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,159
and netlify so it will be like a static

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,200
so

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,679
gemstick hosting and as i am using dbs

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,799
code

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,200
then there is a js json config

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,080
recommended this is just the github name

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
and the kit

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,120
and now it would take some time to

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,640
basically build my project

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,480
but i already like cheated and i

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,080
prepared so this is what you would get

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
at the beginning and after all these

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,600
steps

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,240
as you can see i run the yarn death and

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,480
my

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,000
uh my next already running and you can

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,960
see also like some screen on the lock

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,400
also let's check

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,840
it out so local 2000 and here's the nice

00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,360
welcome stream built by

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,039
next team for you where you can go to

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
documentation check the github and all

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,120
the packages they have like tons of

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,080
great uh

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,880
stuff around the next so okay i see that

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,559
my project

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,080
it's next and this is basically

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,000
something what you could theoretically

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,760
deploy to barcelonetlify versailles

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,520
or your own servers and it's it's

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,280
working that's great

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,679
but we need to set up also like uh

00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,120
something for the uh for our content for

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,400
our content editors who are not

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,360
technically like the

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:27,520
best like the people who going to code

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,080
and code everything or to the

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,440
markdown or other stuff so what you can

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,280
use you can use something like a

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,679
storyblock which is a headless cms

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:37,200
and you maybe heard about the headless

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,400
lately because it's getting more and

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,799
more popular

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,760
and after the registration it's uh in

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
this cloud

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:46,320
uh cloud service so which is like

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,480
service uh as a software as a service

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,840
uh you will get uh to the screen like

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
this where you can manage our your

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,640
project

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,159
and you can create a new space in the

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,200
storyboard we call spaces

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,000
uh basically a project so it's uh where

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,200
at some hub where you will be uh

00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,559
managing your content

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,400
as you can see on the left side i have

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,320
like many demo demo projects

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,919
but now we are going to create like one

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,360
from scratch so we are creating just a

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,600
new space we are not going to play with

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,679
demo and i'm not going to duplicate

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,720
anything i'm really creating everything

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,960
from scratch

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,480
so let's give it a name and let's create

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
a new space

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,840
uh at the moment uh we will be skipping

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,080
the uh

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,440
next the step-by-step guide because uh i

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,400
am your guide today

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,960
and uh i would like to also add them one

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,640
more note

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,320
uh everything you see here will be

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,320
probably changing following like

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,280
two three months as we are working also

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,520
a new ui and what do you see so you see

00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,120
basically your project or your space

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,279
and here we are like at the moment in

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,960
the context section so this is what your

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,559
content editor usually would see

00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,720
if they want to change some stuff on

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,039
your website application or

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,640
even uh like like configuration of the

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,159
automobiles so we have like different

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,240
use cases you don't have to be thinking

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,760
about this only as about like something

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,919
like building the website

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,919
you are con you're managing content so

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,080
here this is the story which represents

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,000
the home and is like recreated by us by

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,600
storyblock but you can delete it really

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,440
like if you want

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,360
any moment uh at the moment i can click

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,679
on it and open a visual editor which is

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,760
like

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,960
one of the like i think one of the best

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,960
features we have

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
and the visual editor is like uh the

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
powerful hill is that

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,600
here in the middle you should see right

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,720
now that your website uh at the moment

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,120
we don't see our website

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,640
but we already can explain a schema with

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,320
the project so here on the right side

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,720
you can see you can see

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,559
the content editor at the moment there

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,840
is like some page which has a body and

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,520
there's a teaser grid

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,679
we can add a new block so i can get an

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,120
added teaser which is like

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:43,760
a teaser and i can also like

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,679
like uh move the components here and

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,880
even if i would like to go like focus

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,840
because this is not working at the

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,760
moment so as we did the setup we can

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,760
hide the visual editing part and just

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,559
focus on the form which is like as

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,039
usually it's uh consumed headless cms

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,000
part

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,679
so this is like what you see then this

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,240
is already working as i said so we can

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,159
save

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,279
and you would see like new version but

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,640
uh this also

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,320
created a new json and this is like

00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,200
where the developers come to

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,799
uh to handy that you and we developers

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,039
are basically consuming

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,919
this json files using the rest api or

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,000
the craftql

00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,520
to create the website so render the

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,039
frontend

00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,799
which i will be doing in the moment in

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,799
the next so we can see

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,279
there was a draft json and at the moment

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,039
i have also some publishation which i

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,200
didn't publish so i don't have any json

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,600
at the moment so let's hit publish

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,240
publish and then let's see what's here

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,120
and

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,840
uh one more time my plugin did the

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
trigger

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,080
so here you can see like basically i

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,720
have a body so i have a story

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,279
which is named home and there's a body

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,279
which

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,880
contains a different components and the

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,159
component here is the teaser with the

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,159
headline hello board

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,159
okay that's pretty easy simple and

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:55,120
straightforward so we created just at

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:58,720
the moment

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,960
are are like our content we can already

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
consuming by the next application here

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,120
but we still didn't connect the neck

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,200
jazz here with uh our content so

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,159
we still see here in visual editor like

00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,840
nothing so let's do something with that

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
so what you should do right now is

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,640
basically you can install

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,960
uh the package called uh storyblock next

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,240
and all what does this like create a

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
connection between the storyblock and

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,720
max

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,480
we are taking care basically of this for

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
you so

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,200
what's now i just jump to the next

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,520
conflict so it's super easy and fast

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,520
and here a little bit cheated i pre

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,559
because i am not good in typing so i do

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,400
a lot of typos

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,600
so i just commented a lot of code and

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
here you can see that i

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,840
expect here some access token so in the

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,720
storyboard in the next

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,520
i install a storyblock next module and

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,679
here i should

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
add my token to like collect them

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,279
together so let's

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,200
jump back and here use this token which

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,880
you can use a draft token

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,320
but of course like if you would go like

00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,799
publish version then you could like

00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,440
create a new public token access level

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,279
and then get

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,559
only the token the content that is

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,120
already published

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,120
but let's uh jump back to the code like

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,840
add here

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,120
my token and let's start my project so

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,159
we are on death

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,919
and we should see after a few seconds

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,000
and after the bundling here also on the

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,720
localhost let's check out the lockouts

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,480
what's happening here uh i take a few

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,120
seconds because it's

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,039
bundling a new packages together but the

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,799
hotel is much faster usually and also

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,039
like this usually take a little bit

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:33,039
more longer on the calls i don't know

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,559
why it's probably my internet connection

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:37,120
is not so fast

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,399
so here everything is working great and

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,200
we don't have any error so

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,240
we kind of connected the story block uh

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,240
with the next

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,080
but still i don't see any pro and the

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,000
reason is here it's very simple

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
here in the url which is like in this

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
case it's iframe

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,240
uh you can see like here should be our

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,960
uh url

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,480
and our url is local so let's copy paste

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,760
the localhost url

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,840
and let's jump back to the space

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,080
settings and

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:03,360
change the default uh environment we are

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,559
working on so we are working on the

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,559
locals as a teacher

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,799
but if you need a multiple preview

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,880
developers uh preview urls you can go

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,880
also like something like a production

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,159
and add here like your urls and create

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,559
like version edlify

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,399
and those parts like for different ui's

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,080
you can have even like one pro url for

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,159
direct application and i'll do for the

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,080
next.js or vue.js application

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,840
so everything is possible in here in

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,000
this setup kind of

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,000
so let's go back to the home and see

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,840
what's changed after i edited it

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,399
and if we see a progress we have an

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,120
error and this time the error is a good

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:37,279
thing

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,799
and that's from various places or

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,320
reasons and this is like this is the

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,159
arrow coming from the nexus as you can

00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,000
see in the left bottom corner

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,679
so what is the problem here is that we

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,640
are asking to render some

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,200
slack called home on the localhost as if

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,120
you know

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,360
at least something about the next you

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,880
would know that there is a pages folder

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,840
which is very similar also in the next

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,880
gs and i didn't define here any roads

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,480
for the whole

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,240
so i don't have a home without view here

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,799
i don't have any dynamic

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,960
uh file here that would like uh map to

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,679
the home or any i didn't defend any

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,480
router

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,880
to like uh to to which would tell me

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,399
like what should happen if i get at home

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,320
or i am asked for home so uh i'm here

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,240
on the index so we i could write that

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,520
router or i could create like new home

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,240
folder a file here

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,120
or i have a little little bit a

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,600
different uh

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,200
hack here that i can also tell my visual

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,240
editor here in storyblock that

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,840
i want to render my homepage of course

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,159
on the index page

00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,600
because it's uh the slack here in this

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,120
case this home is only used

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,960
to get the data that i know that i am

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,480
getting the data from home

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,480
and as i change the real path to the

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,200
slash i can already like preview my

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,880
localhost

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,120
directly in the storyblock so i don't

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,320
need a step anymore so cool

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,159
uh but i still don't see my data here i

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,600
did and created some data but i don't

00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,760
see them on the

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,960
uh in the in the visual play editor and

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,960
our content editor still

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,159
cannot do anything with that so what

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,279
about that so

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,159
storyblock is built on the atomic

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,320
design basically so we like the atoms we

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,080
like the components based approach

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,240
and we like the modern frameworks it's

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,760
the vue.js react and all those

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,440
frameworks are building

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,880
basically on that that they are that you

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
are able to build a small pieces

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,799
together

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,320
and using those small pieces you are

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,120
building the bigger sections or

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,440
molecules uh com

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,279
organism pages and everything together

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,320
and you can combine it freely as you

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,919
need

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,679
and this is the same approach we took in

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,679
store block and you can create

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,320
like any number of the components you

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,760
need and define them into two types so

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,799
one of the types is of course the

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,720
content types

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,480
so the content types are used to create

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,200
stories in the story block so here in

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,000
the content

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,840
if i go to create a new story then i'm

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,720
changing my content type so in this case

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,200
i have a page

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,120
but this usually is something like uh

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
article page or could be also out or it

00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,760
doesn't have to be

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,919
always something that's represented by

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,240
visual page it can be something that is

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,679
the data are consumed on other pages and

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,320
then there are a second type of the

00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,000
component

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,440
and in this case it's called an stable

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,519
component

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,919
and these nest stable components can be

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,159
nested in other components so it can be

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,519
so deep as you need so the chain can be

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,200
really long you can go

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,600
uh like a component in component and

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,720
component in component as much as you

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,360
need

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:25,279
and from these components uh we internet

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,559
code and blocks so basically you are

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:28,799
building the blocks of the

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,320
your website or your pages or your

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,600
stories

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,200
and this is also like why the story

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,640
block is kind of called story block so

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,000
you are building stories and blocks and

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,240
to get history block

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,440
so what are they are how they look like

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,919
so here the page

00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,679
is pretty simple i just defined here

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,399
only one attribute and i called him

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,080
call it body and then the type of this

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,840
attribute i call the blocks

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,000
and this means basically that i can use

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,760
here inside and in a stable component

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,240
and it's pretty simple i didn't define

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,960
any other rules so i can do that i can

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,640
use all of my stable convolution then i

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,000
have a feature where i at the moment to

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,559
keep it simple i define

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,080
the name and this is the type text and

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,320
the same here and with the teaser

00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,799
i just sorry i just created the headline

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,360
attribute and also added like type type

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,200
text

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,600
with no rules additional rules and then

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,159
i have a grid where i basically added

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,679
also like the columns with type blocks

00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,120
and here i would like to like also

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,039
change the rules

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,559
for this component and whitelist only

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,000
the features that i am not allowed to

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,440
add any other components

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,360
inside this grid so i did this this

00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,120
this so how it looks like here in the

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,600
content is that if i

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,760
open here and you see here the grid i

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,840
can add only other features i'm not

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,120
allowed to now like choose from

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,200
different components

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,559
and also you can see that at the end of

00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,080
the in the json

00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:49,919
so here in the json you see that i am

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,480
using teaser and the teaser has

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,840
this headline and this headline is only

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,640
text

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,679
so i had set up everything on the part

00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,440
of the story block

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,880
but i didn't uh did do that in this next

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,880
which would be a very similar also in

00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,640
the right world so but i already

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,360
prepared myself so here if i open the

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,880
copolant

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,559
you can see that i have a different

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,760
components for exactly the same

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,120
components more or less

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,880
than i had in my project in storyblock

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,960
so here you can see a teaser which

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,120
basically will expect some props

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,399
and using these props we'll get some

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,880
block data

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,640
type objects required and then i'm just

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,960
rendering some html

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,720
this is still this view too is by the

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,440
way there's already view three and but

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,279
nooks is still

00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,039
written in view too and then will be the

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,000
next three will be coming soon

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,960
if you are like the view uh expert but

00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,279
anyway

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,320
back to the code so the h2 here i'm just

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:44,559
writing my headline

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,360
with little bit styling of the l from

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,960
tailing

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,360
the same thing i'm basically going to do

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,880
with feature rendering my plug name

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,480
into the h2 here is a special thing that

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,039
you can also notice already on the

00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,200
teaser

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:58,880
that i am using vadi table this was also

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,080
installed by the storyblock

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,519
next thing and this is how we enable our

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,919
real-time editing so stay

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,919
tuned for it you will see in a moment uh

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,079
the power how powerful is it

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,520
the grid here it's at the moment also

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,520
like getting the same

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,960
same principle just getting the data to

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,839
the prop called block

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,399
and then i'm looping through all my uh

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,399
sorry

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,399
through all my columns here that i

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,119
defined here so if i go here into the

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,480
home to show you

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,320
that one more time and i would go to

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,520
grid

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,359
sorry uh read here

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,200
when you see that here in the grid i

00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:36,399
have this array of columns so i'm

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,720
looping through this la

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,639
array and just rendering basically my

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,520
dynamic using the dynamic component the

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,560
components that

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,079
are inserted inside so in this case this

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,919
is something which is in huge as a

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,520
default dynamic component and i can tell

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,040
him like hey

00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,280
render the component which is equal to

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,760
block.component

00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,639
and block.component is this feature

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,359
basically

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:01,040
at the moment and the feature of course

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,480
as i already showed you is this so this

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,320
will be rendered

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,160
and the last thing is the page which

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,160
also do a very similar thing to the grid

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,280
just looping uh through the block the

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,760
body and

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,880
render all the all the components that

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,200
it's getting here

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,320
instead of this code dynamic component

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,079
great so

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,760
at the moment i just need to register

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,880
these components uh

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:26,079
do it all the way so let's

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,800
do this look if everything is

00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,480
uh restarted i think it was quite fast

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,720
so it could be done

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,680
and if i do a reload i don't see

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,599
anything so

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,440
it's still i didn't connect it and the

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,960
reason why i don't uh see any

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,800
change here is that because i still

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,000
didn't uh tell the knight just how to

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,280
load the data from the story

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,520
basically i didn't fetch any data

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,119
so let's uh do the last step we need to

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,880
get uh those data

00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:52,720
and the data we are going to get through

00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,640
the pages so here i just keep it in the

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,760
index.js that all the code

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,599
uh but uh basically i would also can uh

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,359
like abstract that outside to java

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,520
standalone javascript file and erase it

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,119
on many places first of all i am going

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:07,359
to remove my html

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,760
uh which was provided by the next team

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,720
so already remove this part

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,520
and uncomment my part so this is like

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,760
the section

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,119
which uh always will end it to the page

00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,800
so this is like

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,480
where we will decide what kind of page

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,320
we would like to render

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,960
in the index so here you see

00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:26,880
story.content.component would return

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,359
that page and we don't need the logo

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,880
anymore

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,560
because we are not going to render the

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,599
logo of the next anymore

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,960
uh also i am going to uncomment this

00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,320
part which will load the data

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,760
and remove all the style oh sorry uh

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,240
here so let's remove the style

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,520
and we are as we are using tailing then

00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,920
we don't need a styling

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,760
so what we are doing here we are

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,200
familiar a little bit with view jazz

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,359
then i'm just creating like um

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,119
this is uh just dummy content so like

00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:59,359
hey expect some story

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,560
with empty content and then using the

00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:02,400
asynchronous data

00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,839
i'm going to load my data from

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,480
storyblock i

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,560
install the storyblock api using the

00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,480
storyblock next uh packages i installed

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,480
the beginning and now i can statically

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,119
ask for syrian stories dot hall

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,720
as home so there is the name of my slack

00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,560
or my story

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,400
in this moment i'm just going to always

00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,760
ask for the home and i always ask for

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,280
the draft version but in

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,280
like production project you would do

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,200
something like okay i need to check out

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,359
if i'm like in the draft version or i'm

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,000
needing a published version according to

00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,960
to the point that i'm in the development

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,119
environment or i'm

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,000
in production environment for example

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:38,720
and the same thing goes

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,320
for slack you can like uh dynamically

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,400
find uh from their contacts

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,240
what slack you select you would like to

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,880
ask for so here for example i am asking

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,040
for home

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,920
but if this would be like article page

00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,920
number one then

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,599
this will be then you will be asking for

00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,000
article number one

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,040
so cool that's straightforward just get

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,200
the data

00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,480
okay and then the data will be at the

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,400
end replace

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,560
here in the storybox so the stories will

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,640
be replaced by the real data

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,920
okay what's happening here does

00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,520
everything run

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,800
correctly or did i forget something too

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,960
we are we should see here already

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:17,440
something

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,040
and the reason why we don't see it we

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,760
will see in moment by mid

00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,760
just the next

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,880
did i forget something to uncomment

00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,640
eyes i forgot something uncomment in the

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,920
next conflict of course

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,160
i forgot to also

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,119
to uncomment my plugin where i register

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,560
all my components

00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,160
so let's rings to the components really

00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,480
so this component js file where i

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,000
register or import all my components

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,839
i need to also pay that to the next

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,119
conflict of course so

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:54,400
uh now it should work and

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,119
we should see soon here uh something

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,720
so we see our website and at the moment

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,640
we see just the hello world website so

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,640
it's very easy but we also see some

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,000
outline and this outline is created by

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,079
storyblock breach

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,440
which i already mentioned a few times

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,200
and this is the editable in the

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,880
components as you can see now

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,640
i can click on the website and on the

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,160
right-hand side it's basically also

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,960
changing the content

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,079
i am doing even much cooler is like you

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,520
can do something like it

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,119
isn't it's

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,200
ah isn't this cool

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,800
and i can hit save and basically the

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,079
website will reload and i see like

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,400
updated content

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,560
this is quite cool i would say but i

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,359
think as we are doing something with the

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,320
vue.js

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,280
and the negatives we can do even better

00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,359
and

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,480
this safe basically as i hit here the

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,640
save or

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,000
or if i would hear the publish it's

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,640
triggering like the publisher change

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,240
event and then

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,839
i'm asking nashj is like hey can you

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,920
reload the page but

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,079
i could do that also like for the input

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,160
event so here in the storyblock breach i

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,000
am just going to catch and check it for

00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,760
input events and if uh the input is

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,040
happening i'm going to replace

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,920
my story here which i first

00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,800
loaded with this the content getting

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,720
which will i will get from the event

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,800
so how does this exactly look and what

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,440
is the final version is

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:20,240
like this is real uh really cool

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,160
uh that basically i have like real time

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,560
editing experience so i can like now

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,720
change

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,839
stuff i can go to grid i can copy

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,280
everything

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,319
and i add all that stuff this is

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,720
something what i think it's so huge uh

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,440
hugely important for the content editors

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,680
that they

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,880
can work and see what they are creating

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,079
without any

00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,000
basically hitting the safe and

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,520
redeploying or like checking to having

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,040
the localhost you can do this on the

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,040
versailles

00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,079
so they can like pray with on the mobile

00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,599
or on the ipad

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,520
and if the on the mobile is here for

00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:52,880
example doesn't work it like they can go

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,599
delete it

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,599
okay remove this part so let's uh make

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,160
it uh this is really cool on the first

00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,079
remove the

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,680
last part and then if they are really

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,359
happy with the content they should then

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,119
they should have to save and the reason

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,119
why they should have saved after that

00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,960
is that because they are not polluting

00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,599
of course the versioning system of the

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,280
system

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,280
so they didn't have to like always hit

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,640
the safe to see the new version of the

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,440
website

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,119
okay but this is very very simple and i

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,880
wanted to show you like how to create

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,400
like something like a purple

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,319
start of the website where we will be

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,720
featuring some articles so let's

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,000
show how complicated is to create like

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,839
something new with it

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,760
so i'm going to create very quickly just

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,400
article feature articles on the homepage

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,119
and that's it

00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,839
and then it will be the q a so let's add

00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:40,000
here

00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:41,680
article uh complement so article

00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,599
and that will be a content time in this

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,720
case and uh

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,280
oh no and here i am going to add give me

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,640
check

00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,160
give me a sec i'm just looking into my

00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,160
notes how to call

00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,400
hero image will be the first one then it

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,520
will be a title

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,200
then i want to have an intro of course

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:08,079
and which is i already be the typo see

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,960
outdoor and also the froze where i will

00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,240
write my text

00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,079
for our article so let's rename this

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:19,359
to an intro also

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,880
and i need to update the schema so the

00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,720
hero image

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,560
should be probably an image and not the

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,920
text so i'm going to choose a

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,440
asset and an image right the title i'm

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
quite happy that this text

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,240
i would just require it at the moment

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,680
then the intro which i

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,480
a little bit uh did wrong i need to

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:43,920
update the name one more time

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,720
intro save and the intro i would like to

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,040
have it as a

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,800
longer text so text area but without any

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,000
possibilities like doing the bold and

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,599
that kind of stuff because

00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,319
i would have a somehow how to render it

00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,839
in my website then the outdoors i there

00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,400
are like many solutions how to do after

00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:00,960
so you can

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,560
like load the external api or however

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,280
like other stories for the authors but i

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,280
would go for

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,280
the simplest one so the single option

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,440
and just name them here

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:13,839
so i would be the one outdoor

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,319
and this will be basically a drop down

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,680
and dominic will be the second outdoor

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,319
and this is like key value uh basically

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,280
json

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,480
for me and then the last one is the pros

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,160
where i would like to use

00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,000
uh richie's editor at the moment or

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,599
markdown it's up to you usually but

00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,280
let's do our object editor

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,359
where i'm not going to customize the

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,280
toolbar so i have basically created my

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,960
article schema

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,480
and at this moment i don't render i

00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
don't have like article here in the

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,599
story

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,079
in the next project uh but i would like

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:45,280
to

00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,119
i i can already tell my content you know

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,400
the article writers that they can create

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,160
new articles

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:53,280
so i would just like create for them a

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,480
folder called that for the articles

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,160
uh apparel that basically uh

00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,400
the the content that i typed they are

00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,400
going to create this article and save it

00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,319
so then they can go they can go to the

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,839
article folder and create new articles

00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,359
so article

00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,599
one and basically like save it

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,359
uh of course there is no visual prey for

00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,319
that as i didn't create it that

00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:17,119
so then you can like we can just like

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,880
hide it

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,319
and they can start like creating the

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,319
stuff so for example

00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:27,359
they can add some pictures so let's

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:31,359
add here a picture and

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:34,480
wait a second so we will create

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,880
just very quickly three articles that we

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,560
see

00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,359
we have something to preview and i

00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,240
copied some uh texts from

00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:42,480
the next website so here of course we

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,800
would

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,079
like write our uh text but let's save it

00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:54,560
then let's go back and duplicate

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:58,240
so copy call it number two at the moment

00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,359
and i will just uh replace

00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,280
uh the image so here

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:05,280
i will just convert this image number

00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:10,160
two

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,160
and this will be a new headline

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:19,040
okay let's keep that and we change this

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,800
and the last article very quickly

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,800
let's change it to three

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,520
number three and then also the image

00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:34,480
number three

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:38,160
so okay and that's my left reactive

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,520
rocks and that will be me

00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:44,079
great i can save it go back uh

00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,040
let's publish all those articles just to

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,800
show that

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:48,720
how i would publish it very quickly and

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,920
now i would like to feature them on the

00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,280
homepage so basically

00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,280
here on the whole page i would like to

00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,599
feature them here in this array

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,480
but i don't have a component for that so

00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,119
what i have to do

00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,319
write a component so very quickly let's

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,440
create a new component

00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:06,400
i hope i'm not too fast already

00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,040
featured articles uh it will be restable

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,200
of course

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,800
i'm going to use it in different con

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:14,000
components so next

00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,760
and i will be picking some articles

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,440
by hand at this moment so let's

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:22,000
pick a multiple of them so let's go for

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,599
multi-option and as a source uh for this

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,319
multiplication i will go for stories

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:26,960
and in this case will be articles make

00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,000
sense

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,640
so save it uh and it's done

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,280
i already set up my component for that

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:35,440
and i go

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,200
back to the home i can already create

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,240
like use the featured articles

00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,359
i can add it here i can even pick like

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,000
my articles

00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:45,119
i can save it publish it i can check in

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,839
my json that

00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,720
there is those articles featured

00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,480
articles

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,800
uh yeah of course there's too many

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,359
features so here's the component

00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,079
and there's like my uh uids of my

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,880
articles

00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,079
right so i get them but i don't see them

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,560
and the reason i don't see them is

00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,240
because

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,880
it's still then created couple in the

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,000
next still the same

00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,160
so hide the left side and let show the

00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,319
component of the featured article

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,200
very quickly and i will just go very

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,760
fast through

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,240
so here the same approach i'm getting my

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,640
block

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:23,200
my data here i'm rendering basically as

00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,240
a title which i forget to add so we will

00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,720
have to fix that

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,920
then there is like bunch of uh styling

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,880
from the tailwind

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,440
then i'm looping uh through my articles

00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,359
that i

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,200
just added there and rendering a

00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:37,040
component called article teaser

00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:39,040
where i am sending the content of that

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,119
article of course so what is the article

00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:43,040
teaser here is of course your defining

00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,119
the article teaser component

00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,079
and this does nothing else just render a

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:49,040
resized image

00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:49,440
render the title intro and auto plus

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,480
some

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,559
uh telling styling cool and what does

00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,599
this reset image function is just using

00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,800
the storyblock

00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:01,440
image service to just resize the image

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,079
to 300 250

00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,559
very simple so last thing we need to do

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,200
of course

00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:09,280
is also like import those two new r two

00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,200
new components we just created

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,440
so featured articles and artists these

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,640
are i can save it

00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,800
now we should see them

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:21,119
if it's everything correctly done and

00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,960
there is like no error

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:24,960
so what's happening at the moment

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:34,400
did i did featured articles

00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:39,200
featured featured article article teaser

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:42,480
so there's a typo apparently

00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:46,839
so yeah and i did wrong

00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:50,480
the page next unknown

00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:50,480
featured articles

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:55,280
articles

00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:01,359
okay of course

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:10,000
it i have a title somewhere

00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,839
sorry this is the problem of the life

00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,839
coding as always

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:15,599
because i have the featured articles

00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:18,640
here

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,839
and now i'm really i confused

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,280
give me a second probably i

00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:25,359
just name it somewhere wrong in

00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:29,599
storyblock and yes i did it here

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:32,000
wrong so uh here should be

00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:34,000
all right i have to rename it so let's

00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,640
back to the home

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,040
and now it's working right so that was

00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:41,760
the typo of course on my site

00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:42,079
as i was typing and uh here you can see

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
that

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,400
this is this missing title so this is

00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:49,040
the yellow area here so let's fix also

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:51,119
that part very quickly to defense kiba

00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,480
i just need to add a title there they're

00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,119
almost there

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,000
so great as a text that's okay so let's

00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:59,440
save it

00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,559
and let's fill some value there featured

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,200
articles right uh

00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,880
i could save it i can already like play

00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:08,720
with that like reorder it and you can

00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,400
see even that it's changing the rs so

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,119
storybook is the first if i now move it

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,040
to the

00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,880
last part and the next is a struggle is

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,559
the last so

00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,400
the last question you would probably

00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,720
have as a developer is like how is

00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,680
this possible as as i showed you in the

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,559
publish json

00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,880
on the bottom i just getting the uids

00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:27,599
and

00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:29,040
i am not sending the data here so what

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:32,240
i'm doing in the story block

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,440
answer in the next is that i also

00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:37,520
in the index file telling to a story

00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,000
block like i need some result data

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,920
so here in the first anchors call i'm

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:43,920
just also sending like hey please

00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,440
could you resolve the relation that if

00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,960
it's the component called future

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,640
articles and there are some articles

00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,839
please send me the data of the articles

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,839
instead of the uids

00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,680
and the same thing i'm doing here in the

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,520
storyblock breach where i'm basically

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,839
resolving those data

00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,720
so uh sorry here this function here

00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,960
there is a

00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:02,800
relations which uh i'm like defining

00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,599
that featured artist.article should be

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,280
resolved

00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,640
as uh the content uh and then using this

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,000
i can see the live browser and my

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,920
editors can edit

00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,200
and i like this because at the moment at

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,880
the end if you are working with the

00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,559
atomic design and the component based

00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,599
approach you basically can create like

00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:21,119
stuff like

00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:24,720
browse the parts like uh domes or sends

00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,240
uh articles

00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,680
then you see that there was like two

00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,119
articles from samuel and the one from

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:30,240
dominic so i can like remove the

00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:33,359
dominic's one

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:37,040
and then you see only of course i

00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:38,960
hit it wrong one yeah no so

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,839
you see only the sam's articles then you

00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:44,000
can just reload it as you need it

00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:45,359
save it hit the publish the web hook is

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,640
triggering the deployment process and

00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:49,520
everything is deployed

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,040
so this was very quickly the demo with

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,400
storyblock and the next

00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,079
and how to create the application

00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,240
basically and this is like

00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,000
really like a sneak peek that if you

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,400
want to like finish it by yourself then

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,040
you can go to storyblock.com tp

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,760

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:08,079
easily

00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,440
go for story blog uh storyblock.dc sled

00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,280

uh where you can also agree watch this

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:15,520
video one more time

and uh basically also like read a lot of

00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:19,920
tutorials about the neck jazz

00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,680
how to start with like this and how to

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,880
start with storybook or even if you are

00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,160
like the react fan

00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:26,240
and go for the same thing with the

00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,640
negatives and the react and you can have

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,079
the same

00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,040
experience with the react one and the

00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:33,040
lastly

00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,760
storyblock but there's like big team

and we are happy to uh like deliver the

00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,000
great content and i would like to also

00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,520
thank you the vacuum loves the

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,000

00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:06,000
twitter and my dms are open opens uh

00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,440
always open and you can go to

00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,960
samuelsnobco

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,280
and you will find me there thank you

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,280
very much

00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,559
thank you samuel i have to say that it

00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,040
was really fast and it was really

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,040
furious

00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:25,760
so i i had a hard time to to keep up

00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:27,359
with it with the tempo but i will check

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,880
it out also later

00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:34,319
for sure yeah uh here

00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,000
let's check out the questions there

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:38,079
there it seems to be that there are

00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,119
there are none currently

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,440
uh so i will ask one by myself and this

00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,200
is

00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:48,319
this is about the more about product

00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,160
than the technology uh

00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,520
how does it compare to some other

00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,480
e-commerce systems

00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:54,880
uh because for example i have to say

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,400
that

00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,800
we are always looking for some

00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,520
simple block system which will be

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,000
editable

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,400
by non-programmers and there there is

00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,880
some content fold and there we decide

00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,200
that

00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:11,040
we will do it by ourselves and we will

00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:13,359
try some different solution

00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,119
so it's always just uh switching from

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:17,599
solution to solution

00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:19,520
uh so how does this compare to the

00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,720
competition which is quite fierce

00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:27,200
in this field uh that's

00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:30,800
a good question uh it's like uh are we

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:33,119
i just have to think to say it nicely

00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,880
no no no uh what i want to say is like

00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,799
uh against the competition that we have

00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,680
of course uh there's a visual editor so

00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:39,760
that's something

00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:41,040
you can connect with and technology you

00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:44,880
want so

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,799
uh react views well php

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:49,200
and any others uh then we are the

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,280
headless uh cms so uh content manager

00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,960
system it's like what we are focusing on

00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:57,119
on and as a content management system

00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:58,079
we are maybe a cloud base but also for

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,880
the developers

00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:02,160
we have a big value for the developer

00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,920
experience because all of our

00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,920
are basically x developers are still

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,559
developers and we have the stuff like

00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,680
management api so make it easy for you

00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,359
to create those stuff

00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,319
so all the stuff i was showing for

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:16,160
example by clicking you can do also like

00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:18,319
uh by your own scripting

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,359
so we have a customers they built on top

00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:22,079
of our cli

00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:23,520
even their own cli and automize so many

00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:24,319
tasks that they can just create

00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:27,040
basically

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,839
the whole uh project just clicking by

00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,000
few

00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:32,000
command lines and then just hitting the

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:33,440
enter and already like direct component

00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,359
is creating the code base

00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,920
and additional to that is like set up uh

00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:39,839
the also the component in the storyblock

00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:41,040
so this is i think like something's huge

00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:43,200
and of course like

00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,160
tons of other features that i would be

00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,200
like another

00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,920
presentation probably for yeah

00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,040
you have to find by yourself uh just

00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,319
right out

00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:58,160
uh and when you mentioned the uh

00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:59,119
the php the swelt and also some other

00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,680
frameworks

00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:05,760
uh what technology do you support uh

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,200
regarding the loading data from from

00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,839
that cms

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,599
uh so so i'm not sure in your

00:56:09,839 --> 00:56:14,720
presentation it was

00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,880
some some json loaded with the rest is

00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,200
there any other way how to how to load

00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,720
it

00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,200
in your application for example for

00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:23,119
people that prefer graphql

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:25,680
yeah we have also the graphql i mean the

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,880
graphql was released last year

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,240
uh and i was always like encouraged to

00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,319
rest api because

00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:34,160
the rest api is also supported with all

00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:35,680
the packages so if you go for react then

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,839
you can just install the

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,920
package and you know you don't need to

00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,160
know what's happening basically there

00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,000
but if you want to do exactly like do

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:45,440
some crazy loading and do some other

00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,760
application stuff where you need the

00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,640
parts of the components or like the

00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,079
stories

00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:52,000
then exactly for that there is the

00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,880
graphql which uh

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,559
we are working uh a lot on also this

00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,359
year on it so there will be like version

00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:02,400
two of rest api even this year probably

00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:04,240
and with that we cover all

00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,799
i mean all the needs of today's

00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:10,480
developers the rest and clear graphql is

00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,839
the what is need to be covered i think

00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,440
yeah i

00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:18,079
pretty much these days maybe

00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:20,160
some soap system for some some some

00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,640
legacy businesses you know

00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,599
yeah maybe it's true but yeah we hope

00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,480
that they will

00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,760
they should change yeah definitely

00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:29,680
definitely yes

00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,880
uh okay thank you very much for your

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,680
presentation again

00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,319
uh people will have to watch through it

00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,760
once again

00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:40,880
on on how to speed for sure uh

00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:45,040
sorry for that speed uh

00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:47,359
but there was a warning in the title uh

00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,319
that it will be fast and furious uh but

00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,119
there was that was

00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,680
