Connecting optional data into strongly typed components using TS
𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧 
Typescript is very useful when it comes to developer confidence and speed of development if done right. We started adopting Typescript in our codebase and encountered a problem where data from the Redux state might be potentially undefined. There were multiple ways how to resolve this. One option was to override the type and enforce it when returned from Redux. We have decided to solve the problem more generically. We will take a look at the advantages and drawbacks of a few solutions including our chosen one.

Fast & Furious - Going headless with Nuxt.js!
𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
This will be fast & furious! I will show you the fastest possible way to connect your Nuxt.js (Vue.js) project to the headless CMS and deploy it in seconds. You should know a thing or two about Nuxt.js, headless CMS in general or JAMstack as there will be no time to describe the concepts in detail. In the end, you will be furious at how insanely good the JAMstack is!
A sneak peek into the future headless eCommerce
Join us as we look into our crystal ball and predict the future! Jamstack brought us decoupled (not dystopian)) architecture. This new wave of SaaS products and services is here to stay. The advantages are clear:
- better UX
- better DX
- faster websites
- more effective development
- previews with real-time editing experience
- no need to know everything
- we can focus!
It’s clear that the industry will see continued growth in Jamstack & headless. Join me to learn how to take advantage of these technologies to build an eCommerce solution with Nuxt, Vue Storefront, BigCommerce and Storyblok, the headless CMS.

Stay home. Stay safe. And, stay connected to the community.
We realize our meetups and gatherings were not just about the high-quality content talks but mostly about the post networking and discussions you could lead with like-minded developers. We are planning on keeping the Slack channel for communication about all of our following online meetups, your one on one communication, and hope it will be the meeting point of our online community.
