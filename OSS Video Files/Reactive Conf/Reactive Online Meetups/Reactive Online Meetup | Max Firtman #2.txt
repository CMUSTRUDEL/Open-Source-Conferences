Create React App and other toolchains create a Service Worker and other components so your React app can be a Progressive Web App with just a blink of your eyes. Are you aware of how your app will work on each platform? Have you ever installed your React app as a PWA on Android, iOS, or desktop browsers? Did you know you can publish your React app in app stores?
In this session, we will understand what a Progressive Web App is and how to customize the experience from a React-point of view so it can have a proper installation process on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and other platforms with the best possible user experience, including guaranteeing offline access and using new web APIs. We will see how to create your own installation and update management component within your React App.
We will understand how to extend the autogenerated Service Worker with more features, the lifecycle of the app, and how to save state between sessions. Finally, we will see how we can leverage our PWA and use the App Stores to distribute it.

decision to come here

fun for you and you're gonna find it

00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:44,519
interesting my name is Marcel clemo I'm

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:45,960
currently the CMO of vacuum labs and if

00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:51,530
you're wondering what's this vacuum

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:54,570
marks well years years years ago in 2015

00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:56,250
it was actually vacuum labs which hosted

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,160
and started one of the first reactive

00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:05,880
comps and we've been sort of in the back

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,460
helping out helping organize and really

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,369
the team got created out of the space

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,070
where vacuum house was at the time

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:15,990
vacuum labs is really where what we do

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,270
is we provide software engineers to

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,159
FinTech projects blockchain projects

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,950
online marketplaces those sorts of

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,619
things and some of the ones you might

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,119
know as Kiwi comm which I mean you

00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,520
wouldn't be flying now but normally you

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,350
would be able to get really good prices

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,420
and really good flights through Kiwi

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,700
comm reporter could the Cardinal

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,640
foundation on their wallet and one of

00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,380
our most exciting projects is mocks in

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,880
Hong Kong which is one of the first

00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,829
virtual banks that we're building there

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,570
so doing lots of different things and

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:46,619
we've really been helping out reacted

00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,789
from the very beginning

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,020
making it of course through Miki it was

00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:54,479
the biggest organizer from the very

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,899
beginning making it awesome throughout

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,479
the whole thing so I'm right now the CMO

00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,359
but a few years back I was a programmer

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,549
I was a developer I don't think that was

00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,009
that great so I just chose a path of

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,649
helping those developers that are greats

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:13,620
get to the right clients and find the

00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:16,470
right fit for what they do and I'm so

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:18,690
excited today to talk about to welcome

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:21,000
maxford minh who's gonna be talking

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,590
about progressive web apps something

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,630
that I remember way back in the day

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,150
Steve Jobs started talking about he

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:28,310
didn't call them pwace but that's what

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,160
they were

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:35,910

00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,280
thank you thank you so max is a

00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,760
brilliant mobile and web developer and

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,260
when I sort of started I haven't met you

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,599
before but when I started looking like

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,080

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,010
just like an endless stream of content

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:55,890
whether it's your stuff on plural side

00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,959

the god of PWA on this meetup today I'm

00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,880
not sure if a God or devil will see so

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,720
just before we get to get to the talk

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,090
itself

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,400
let me just small organizing those to

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,650
start off with so we have the Q&A that

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,750
is possible through the chat that you

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,190
see on your left or right depending on

00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,769
where you're looking

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,540
therefore please ask any questions we're

00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,910
gonna get to a Q&A session after the

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,620
presentation maybe if there's something

00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,840
really really urgent we might jump in

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,430
but in general the goal would be to let

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,410
max go through the entirety of this

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,690
presentation and then we go to the Q&A

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:37,980
session and after if you still have

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,019
questions or there are things that come

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,630
up a little later for you feel free to

00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,389
go into slack our slack channels are

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,540
full of conversations and let's let's

00:03:45,389 --> 00:03:50,190
continue the conversation afterwards so

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,060
max I'm just gonna I'm just gonna let

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:57,299
you get started this is your very cool

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,280
go Thank You Myrtle well hello everybody

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,269
think let me share my screen so we can

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,269
start with that

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:12,930
one there so this is going to be

00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:14,849
uncovering secrets of PWA we react so as

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,620
one fell fell my name is Maximiliano I

00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:19,500
can go by Max I know it's a long name

00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:24,060
I'm Roberto Twitter fi your team so it's

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:27,720
simple four letters I have around 40 45

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,940
minutes of content here so if you

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,520
already know what the PWA is you will

00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,780
find some part that's kind of boring so

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,750
I will do an intro because there are a

00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,780
lot of developers out there not exactly

00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,470
knowing what the PWA is I'm not going to

00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,330
get to fear

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,160
how about that and even if you know

00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:47,980
whether PW is I'm pretty sure that you

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,510
will find some new information about new

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,700
platforms or new features that are

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:54,730
available today that might be helpful

00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,650
and after that I will try to me about

00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:58,690
some secrets so if you are doing react

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:00,550
applications some things that you need

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,620
to understand and do check generally

00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:07,860
have a good experience so that's the

00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:11,260
idea so let me go jump directly so I'm a

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,450
web developer since this browser so I've

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,940
been doing web development for around 24

00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:19,060
years and also mobile developers I'm

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,820
also a native mobile developer and now

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:25,860
mixing boasts English's the web and

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,990
mobile to create for example pwace so

00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:33,160
after March 29 at home in Buenos Aires

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:37,390
Argentina my home by the way it's a

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,880
brutal background and I'm typically when

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:43,090
there is no pandemic around

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,900
frequent-flyer so I've been to 73

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:50,590
countries no Slovakia so you need to go

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:53,260
there and typically for trainings and

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:56,710
conferences I've written a couple of

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,660
books ok from O'Reilly I'm doing

00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:01,540
trainings I'm consulting all over the

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:04,900
world on different Englishes mostly on

00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,370
mobile app development and as Marcel

00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:09,000
mentioned there are a lot of content

00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,400
that you can find on different libraries

00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,770
Reilly Safari LinkedIn learning and even

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,000
Torah site and by the way just more

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,380
parentheses

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,230
[Music]

00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,800
- takes my PWA cords for free so no

00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:29,500
credit card no no nothing it's gonna get

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:35,590
that course they are it's for two more

00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:37,810
days only for eight okay so pwx

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:41,290
progressive web apps let's try to define

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:44,500
what they are and before that if you are

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:46,960
doing react and maybe you maybe you've

00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,510
heard about the term the PW return but

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,050
you didn't actually develop the PWA if

00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:54,910
you were using create react app so this

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,430
tool to create your your first app and

00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,550
of course compile and do everything

00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,330
react I'm not sure if you if you are

00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:07,360
aware that template that create react

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:09,550
app is creating already has two PWA so

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,190
you were really creating a PW and this

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:14,290
is not maybe yes I know I knew that or

00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,450
didn't know that let me show you this so

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,780
there are big companies actually using

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:21,610
creative react apps for their apps when

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,370
you create an app you will find a

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,710
manifest file it's a JSON file within

00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:29,410
your project that looks like that and if

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:32,110
you don't change that and there are a

00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:34,630
lot of apps out there but are not

00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,210
changing that file because probably they

00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,580
don't know what the filing for you have

00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:42,040
this problem so this is field like a

00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:43,930
system from Apple so it's a it's a new

00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:45,610
app it's a react application using to

00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,850
create react application you can find it

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:51,310
on feedback assistant on apple.com that

00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:53,560
it's a bit of anyway and I think that

00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,720
they didn't know that they did web

00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,510
developers that did this because even if

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:02,190
you sell the app the app the name is

00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,230
react app so it's the default Jai kisaan

00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:08,500
that came with create react application

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,780
if you google react app in the title for

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,920
the JSON file you will find thousands of

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,630
apps out there with the default

00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:20,470
manifest.json file so that's a problem

00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:22,120
so for react developers the first the

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,490
first suggestion here is like please

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,400
don't leave that file after days because

00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,040
it has no idea contour in fact when iOS

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,900
it has no icon on another operating

00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,849
system is the react icon

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:38,050
and the name of your app will be reactor

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:41,409
okay so let me try to define play anyway

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,470
so I this is a net magazine from UK but

00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,210
we can find in Europe us unfortunately

00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,270
not here in Argentina

00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:52,210
so I authored the Coker article and I

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:55,720
really like the design of the article so

00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,430
I'm I'm not the designer of that but so

00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,700
you can see that the review a it's kind

00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:04,300
of the new DNA of the web so I like that

00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:11,820
idea of the new or the carrot DNA of the

00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:15,490
work so I talked about be important so

00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:17,709
PW is actually an open definition so

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,589
it's not completely clear what it is

00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,330
okay it was originally created by Google

00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,279
the concept the name I'm not talking

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:26,050
about so little about the name not about

00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,100
the concept was marcelles mentioned

00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:32,890
before the idea of PWA was first seen in

00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,040
a mobile device without all with Steve

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,110
Jobs in 2007 so he was presenting the

00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,600
idea of using web technologies to create

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:42,010
mobile apps and when talking about

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,290
mobile apps and when it was installed

00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,300
mobile apps that look and behave like

00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:49,300
other apps on the system and that's a

00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:52,839
quote from Steve Jobs so today it's a

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,839
concept the PWA term is embraced by most

00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,709
companies not Apple but this embraced by

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,290
Google Samsung Microsoft Mozilla Firefox

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:06,279
and many others the only one that is not

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:07,900
actually using the turn is up okay but

00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,350
that doesn't mean that Peter value is

00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:13,660
don't work there they work there with

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:16,810
some differences okay but it's is

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,760
they're so oppressive web app is just an

00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:21,820
app built with web technologies for

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,640
example react then it should work fast

00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,620
while online or offline so here comes a

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,140
new part so it should work offline as

00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,890
well it can be installed on different

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,200
platforms oops

00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:34,089
what happened anyway so we are thing

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,450
with the keynote so it can be installed

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:39,550
on different platforms so that means a

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:41,350
shoe means that you have an icon it

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,779
looks like any other app in the system

00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,300
and it it appears like like other apps

00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:52,680
so the user doesn't actually know that's

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:55,110
a PW HSN app and it is ideal for all

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:57,089
those apps out there that just consume

00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,220
web content or web services so if you

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:03,059
have a mobile app let's say native app

00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,459
or that is just downloading JSON from a

00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:07,829
web server or send it data to a web

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,720
server and there isn't anything more

00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:12,360
than that and if you think about this

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,809
most of their of the apps are actually

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:19,430
under this scheme then pwace they deal

00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,430
platform because

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,690
we are web engine that is very good

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:26,940
doing that

00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:27,840
and if doing if you're using Kotlin or

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,310
so yes time by the way I'm also

00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,279
convinced with developers I'm not

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,410
actually against or or native develop in

00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:38,220
doing those of native apps as well but

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,440
at this point it I need to deserve to

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:42,210
actually go native because most of the

00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,940
time we actually done need that it's

00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:47,400
just consuming web content or web

00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,980
services and unchaste that compete a

00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,870
video it's actually pretty good for that

00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,240
so a bit earlier just a web app for

00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:56,190
example you react application there is

00:11:54,240 --> 00:12:01,050
another layer on top known as service

00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:03,300
worker I will do a quick intro / idea of

00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:06,060
Service Worker in a minute and then any

00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,790
tribution channel ok so I know that if

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:12,029
you already know what the pwace is you

00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:14,190
were expecting on that last layer

00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:16,500
weatherman says I'm I'm talking about

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:19,350
the distribution and there are different

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,420
ways to distribute the PWA one is the

00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,760
web manifest that JSON file that I

00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,170
mentioned before

00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:31,770
so um typically when we define that we

00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:34,110
want to develop some apps for you we can

00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,940
use native SDKs we can use web

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,910
development so these were like the

00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,620
typical two approaches to create to

00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:43,310
create apps even react native is

00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:45,810
actually part of ninety Vesta case so

00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:48,390
with a 90 basic case we are compiling

00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,980
now for one specific device with web

00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:53,430
development we are compiling up for the

00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:55,830
browser of course in the past 10 years

00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,170
we also had hybrid development that was

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,350
double PhoneGap or Apache Cordova

00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:03,510
in this case we were mixing native SDKs

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,120
with web development but we were

00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:09,540
targeting devices specifically viruses

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:14,370
so Android or iOS or Windows or

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:17,100
blackberry read recipes where is PWA

00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,350
here well Peter video is actually in the

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,450
web development layer ok in the Webley

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,700
relevant layer but with a difference

00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:26,070
because it's in the world layer it can

00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:29,430
actually run in the browser like any

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:33,120
reactor web application but it can also

00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:37,470
be executed as a native app

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:40,829
the 90 warp here it's it's weird but it

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:43,319
can act as a standalone app on specific

00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:44,990
devices so that's the idea okay so it

00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:47,519
will target the browser but also

00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,100
different devices and when we are

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,079
talking about react we can actually if

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,550
you're using react AF to create web apps

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,740
of course you are in that web

00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:59,189
development side but if you're using

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:02,069
react native you can target reactivating

00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:06,389
for web and with react native or web

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:08,579
then you can actually create a PWM so

00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:10,170
these are the two places from react

00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,170
where you can actually create a bit of

00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:16,139
video there are many companies doing

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:20,220
pwace these days more companies are

00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:22,589
appearing every day the last we don't

00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,499
have enough information about how many

00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:28,680
apps do we have but the only public

00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:32,699
information that I have is from Diego

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,699
here from Samsung that said that on

00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:39,139
Samsung over 20 millions PW

00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:42,050
installations happen in last year over

00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:45,689
80,000 domains so 80,000 domains is

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,999
roughly 80,000 Peter Lewis roughly okay

00:14:45,689 --> 00:14:50,069
and this is just one browser samsung

00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:54,420
internet browser that is not of course

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:56,850
the most used browser on Android so but

00:14:54,420 --> 00:15:01,920
that's kind of the amount of PW waste

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:04,499
out there so there are many PW exclusion

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:07,410
react in fact I can bet that most of the

00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:09,509
apps pwace out there are based on react

00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,160
of course there is no need for that but

00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:13,829
that means one of the most used

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,470
framework for pwace so just should take

00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:17,490
some examples for reaction is Twitter

00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:20,100
and Starbucks

00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:24,629
they're both react Jas apps that are

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,670
pwace I have one that is premium it's

00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:29,819
coat rack so that was developed here in

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,759
Argentina so it's a it's an app for for

00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:36,029
copy 19 so to track users with the

00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:38,279
location but anyway they have they use

00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:41,040
react native so they have the iOS and

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,850
the Android native apps from reality but

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,769
they also created a react native or web

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,410
target and you can go to that you

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,639
in Spanish and dot quit darkness that

00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:54,029
comes I'll take care of ourselves

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,009
something that does come and and you can

00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:58,499
install it I said PWA on on every

00:15:56,009 --> 00:16:00,089
platform okay and that's react native or

00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:04,769
web so it's an example of how you can

00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:06,509
create pwace also with react native so

00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:08,730
let's put a little bit about support

00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:12,149
today on Android so here you have a

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,160
video of the J's conf website so you can

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:16,799
actually watch the home screen that URL

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:19,189
and that's actually creating a PWR in

00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:19,189
android

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,430
oh no it can be installed on Chrome

00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,860
Firefox or a Samsung you see web and

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,570
even Microsoft edge okay so you can see

00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:32,400
there that after you must install it

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,850
looks like any other app in the system

00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:39,810
that J is called app so talking about

00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:41,520
that one okay so after you was installed

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:44,910
it looks like any other app in the

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,610
system on on Android on iOS it's working

00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,430
on Safari only for Safari so if you are

00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:53,660
using Chrome on iOS Firefox on iOS by

00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:57,300
the way they're not Chrome and Firefox

00:16:53,660 --> 00:17:00,150
you can install pw8 from iOS only and

00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,910
also you have on mobile devices so for

00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:05,730
support for iOS or geophones these are

00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,980
feature phones that are actually

00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:12,630
available in mostly in Africa and South

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:14,550
Asia there they support pwace it's in

00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:17,400
fact that's the only way to create apps

00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:21,420
for for those devices so these are the

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,740
options for for mobile devices on iOS

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,750
for example I'm going to show if you're

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,970
aware of tinder have you ever tried in

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:29,190
there where teen.com is a PWA so you go

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,740
to the website it's a website but then

00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,510
you click on share and add to a home

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,880
screen I need to update this the video

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,420
because now on iOS the latest version of

00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:43,560
iOS it's a different sheet and then it's

00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:45,780
a kingler app that looks standalone so

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:48,750
it's not actually running in Safari

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,980
it looks like the tinder app okay

00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:55,740
this was actually what was created by by

00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:59,340
iPhone OS 2.0 a long time ago so that

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,160
was presented by by skin shops this is

00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:04,320
still today the same technique but it's

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,800
it was improved so it's actually much

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,010
better today so on next up you can also

00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:12,270
install the indexer so you can you have

00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:14,550
can install these for example on

00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:16,620
Chromebooks Windows 10 Windows 7 Mac or

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:18,600
Linux for example here you can see the

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,670
Starbucks application installing Windows

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,860
7 as an app

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:24,270
sober you thinking Windows 7 who cares

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,370
about that but think about the

00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:27,900
enterprise work and if you're doing

00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:31,860
enterprise application and there you

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:33,240
have another way so also installation

00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,180
through the browser in this case

00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,490
Windows doesn't need I mean I mean

00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:41,610
straighter permissions so every user

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:43,380
that can actually use Chrome or the new

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,300
Microsoft edge can actually install it

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,870
Peter you a even without being and mink

00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,970
on that particular device then you can

00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,780
have a desktop application okay

00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,610
same here on Windows 10 okay trabajo you

00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,560
can install three bubble from desktop

00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:01,110
and now you have a trabajo application

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:07,230
running on on within the same the same

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:10,290
Mac Linux and on Chrome OS so it's also

00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:16,290
been around extra but you still happy

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:18,870
sticks and after that means if you if

00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,870
you wanna run the app with offline

00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:23,040
support and great performance

00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:26,490
ninety-three percent of users browsing

00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:29,670
the web can actually have that pwace of

00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,740
work okay before 100 percent a few cents

00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:33,510
or ninety nine eighty ninety something

00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:36,660
in case you are not supporting all the

00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:38,760
browsers can actually access your your

00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,670
web app online while they are online

00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:43,380
only man I give three percent can also

00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,510
access it offline and will be right

00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:48,870
performance and eighty six connection

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:51,150
install that up right these are pretty

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:54,170
big numbers so in terms of who is

00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:56,160
actually supporting the PWA platform

00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:59,250
unfortunately we don't have full support

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,450
or plans from several browsers for

00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:08,220
example I think that most important part

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:10,290
here then find this is the web view when

00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,650
I Android and iOS because that's

00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:16,050
actually Facebook when you are clicking

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,590
on a link on Facebook on both iOS and

00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,210
Android

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:20,400
you're not rendering that app in the

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:23,070
browser that web site in the browser but

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,860
within Facebook that's using a web be

00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,930
and there is no PWA support on that so I

00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:31,280
think that's that's the problem so if

00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:34,050
you're well if your react application is

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,330
heavily based on social networks and

00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:38,750
links on social networks that might be a

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,540
problem okay so this is one of the

00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:43,860
restrictions that we have today so happy

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,600
the only way we have a couple of

00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:47,040
forensic features they see what content

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,060
we will add instant

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,070
a service worker and our usage okay and

00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,690
experience will need to react to

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:57,270
different environments like being online

00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:01,020
offline we need to offer a good

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:02,850
experience the same coach should deliver

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,130
different level of quality twitter is

00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:08,400
actually doing this the same Twitter

00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:11,700
codebase runs on feature phones on smart

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,480
TVs on Windows as a text about from the

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:19,580
Microsoft Store on Chromebooks or on

00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,580
Dexter of course Android iOS right

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,590
single codebase main decision about

00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,140
limited is going to offer to actually

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:31,020
keep the same quality not the same

00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,430
abilities but the same quantity and of

00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,740
course we need a lot of new API is that

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,870
you need to learn to detect environment

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,870
and to act in consequence in terms of

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:43,200
what you actually you can do okay so

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:46,680
that was the intro to the PWA platform

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:51,180
so let's start talking about secrets

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,580
so secrets I mean I'm not here like get

00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,830
like a goddess

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:57,240
so we're mentioned before but secrets

00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:59,730
means that there are a lot of things

00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,920
that a lot of developers are unaware of

00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:03,930
no because they're actually secrets

00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:06,510
right but so we're going to uncover

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,520
these things that are really important

00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,280
for a Google user experience when you're

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,950
doing an app because now your react app

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,410
is not just running on the browser or in

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:20,520
the server it's running as NASA as an

00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:23,190
app in its own contain window or as a

00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:25,890
standalone experience so that's why we

00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:28,770
need to understand the differences let's

00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:31,650
start talking about the app lifecycle so

00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,870
today when you load an app mean you open

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,980
a bit of Ewing okay it appears

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:39,780
yeah uploads ok then at at some point

00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,520
the apps goes to the background well

00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:44,190
there is an event there that you can buy

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,400
and he'll be civility change but what

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:49,890
happened into the background is still

00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:52,470
running what happens if I have a timer

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,980
in my react application that is actually

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,990
fetching

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:57,750
he means from the network every 5

00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:59,130
minutes if that timer see working in the

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:00,160
background have you ever thought about

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,240
that

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,460
so what's going on here what the answer

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,670
is that typically no okay your

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:14,260
javascript is actually suspect okay

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,750
there is a point where the app will be

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,390
suspended and also you have a new event

00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,920
the freeze event this is currently

00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:24,280
available only in chromium based

00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,360
browsers but it's a w3c API it might

00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,940
appear on others

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,930
another browsers as well that will let

00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:34,450
you know that the app will freeze okay

00:23:31,930 --> 00:23:36,370
so in case you need to post your timers

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,380
maybe you need to talk to your server

00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:40,750
say hey server you know what I know we

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,910
are we have a session here going on but

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:46,360
the user is out of the app the app will

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:48,940
be suspended so let's stop this now what

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,240
happens if the user goes back to yet if

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,820
the app is still in memory okay that's

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,710
one one option nothing really happens

00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,100
okay everything like restarts

00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:02,530
automatically so that happens many times

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:05,380
I mean you you get out of an app you go

00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,490
back and yet is still there okay but

00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:08,770
there is another option

00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:11,770
maybe well by the way in this case

00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:13,720
Raziel will be executed and be willing

00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:17,100
to change okay so there is a resumable

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:21,280
telling you that hey we are coming back

00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:23,800
from a suspended state and maybe mainly

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,720
a week has passed that's not typically

00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:29,080
on a normal phone because you don't have

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,910
too much run but if the app is still in

00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,770
memory it's because typically a couple

00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:35,710
of hours have passed and you haven't

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:37,600
used the phone a lot but a lot of time

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,660
has passed and maybe you don't want to

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,070
restore the app it's beautiful state

00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:44,770
maybe you need you to something else I

00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:46,870
mean if it's a home banking app you

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,580
probably want to log out the user you

00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:51,640
don't want to keep that user logged in

00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,710
after five hours there is another option

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,330
the option can be that the app was

00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:58,270
discarded for example you open the

00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,890
camera okay are you you're recording a

00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,430
video you are doing something really

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:04,870
heavy that needs memory so in that case

00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:07,360
but the user goes back to the app and

00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,640
the app will start from scratch your PWA

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,760
will start from scratch in that case the

00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,890
normal loading process will be fired but

00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,710
now there is a boolean

00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:19,050
attribute in document document was

00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:20,340
discarded that will tell you the idea is

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:23,220
the user he society in the aftermath

00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,290
scratch which is actually coming from a

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,500
previous session that was discarded from

00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:30,300
memory and in this case you can actually

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,640
restore the state I mean if you're doing

00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,950
redox or you've seen the state hooks you

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,320
can actually find a way to restore the

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:41,040
states of your components or or the

00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,790
state of your app to actually provide a

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:46,230
good user experience okay so that's the

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:48,570
life cycle unfortunately if you're

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:50,910
actually not working in iOS I don't know

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:54,000
if it depends on the version for child

00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:56,280
today it's much better but the the life

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,070
cycle can be like this I'm not expecting

00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:02,760
you to the Sandy's wrath it's not for

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:06,690
this is for 13.0 so now it's much better

00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,550
in the current version anyway for iOS at

00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,190
least the recommendation is to provide a

00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:13,320
reload action within your UI so a button

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,620
ok a reload that will just do JavaScript

00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,540
reload because there is no simple way to

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,540
reload your app typically

00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,170
of course provide full navigation up

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:27,570
from Chester's which my us we don't have

00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:32,640
a backpack like on Android physically or

00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:34,410
or beautifully always visible the

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,540
lifecycle is a good candidate for a

00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:39,780
reacts cook to create your own custom

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:42,450
hook to actually manage the lifecycle so

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,660
I some ideas you can then decide per

00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:48,390
component with a hook the state that you

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,880
if you want to reset the state or update

00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,700
the state after that discard so after

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,400
that the app world is coming from memory

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:59,220
also you can have a hook or the same

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,140
hook that can calculate the time passing

00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,030
between sessions so you can make better

00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,130
decisions about what you want to do with

00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:09,270
your experience after one minute or

00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:10,830
after five hours or after month and also

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:12,690
you can you see if you do some smart

00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,000
detection on iOS there are some tricks

00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:20,760
that you can use allow us to detect when

00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:22,500
the user gets out and goes back so this

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,630
customer ID yes okay for you to

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:28,290
implement on or to react to actually

00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:30,630
provide a better experience there is

00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,060
also something that is not well known

00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:34,800
out there so there is a persistent

00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,710
oestereich api than just you can see

00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,290
it's pretty simple it's just one line

00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:42,780
navigator dot storage not persist and

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:45,210
that you should be very careful just to

00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,040
call these api only when it's available

00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:50,270
so that's why you have the conditional

00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,760
first this is a good candidate for

00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:56,760
adding these two bwa config component if

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:58,710
you wanna have one or somewhere in the

00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,770
top level logic well in the react

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,990
upstart let me explain what what this is

00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:06,090
by default the contents of your app

00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:09,120
won't be there in the user's device

00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:12,480
forever so if the I wanna entry for

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,880
example if on Android you have a storage

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,820
fracture if there's pressure means that

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,530
there is no more space available the the

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,110
browser in this case Chrome that is in

00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:26,280
charge of the peer anyway might delete

00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:28,290
data from a lot of tubs and maybe you're

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,390
not expecting that because it salvaged

00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,610
the PWA it was in style I'm expecting

00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:33,880
the contents of the lab to be offline

00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:36,100
always

00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:38,410
if you wanna do that you actually need

00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,940
to ask for it and you asked for it with

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:42,549
this line okay

00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,679
navigator storage persist if you don't

00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:49,059
explicitly asked for this it's not going

00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:51,400
to work the API will grant you access to

00:28:49,059 --> 00:28:54,730
this when the site is bookmarker in this

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,470
case to the offer website if the site

00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:58,150
has high exciting guy trends so if the

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:00,669
user is coming to your website in the

00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:02,470
browser every day or if the site has

00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:05,410
been added to the home screen so it was

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:07,539
installed as a PWA so that means that if

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,690
the user has installed your your app a

00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:12,400
subpoena by the way and you ask for

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:17,370
persistent storage in windy granted at

00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:19,770
least some base Proust that - there's a

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:23,490
percent of the users anyway

00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:25,870
also if the user has push notifications

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,720
enabled so if you ask for permission and

00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:33,120
the user granted the permission you will

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:33,120
also be granted persistent storage okay

00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:37,179
cool remember that if you have any

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,039
questions you can start putting their

00:29:37,179 --> 00:29:43,900
questions in the Q&A panel and we will

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,820
answer those later so let's talk a

00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,530
little bit about platform integration so

00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:49,330
how can we integrate with the platform

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,059
because when they actually doing apps or

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:55,929
devices now shut for an agnostic browser

00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:57,610
or we're actually doing apps for an

00:29:55,929 --> 00:30:00,159
agnostic browser and I know steep lot

00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:04,000
from but also for specific devices so we

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,059
went up like integrate our app in to the

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:10,480
ecosystems of the user will find data

00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:14,559
app like part of the phone part of the

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,880
desktop computer so one thing that you

00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,159
can start doing is web authentication

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,860
with web authentication you can actually

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,760
log in your users or authenticate your

00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:28,030
users pretty simple so in this case here

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,030
we have the example of 100 flowers calm

00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:34,360
you can shut us go to the app the PW

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:36,400
right um log in and it will appear my

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:38,049
reason my gmail account and I can just

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,640
click continuous Maximiliano and I'm

00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:40,630
logging even if I don't have an account

00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,240
there okay

00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,220
so the user doesn't need to sell any

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,929
form it's actually pretty simple and

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:51,009
pretty fast okay your

00:30:46,929 --> 00:30:53,649
and now you're logging also on iOS now

00:30:51,009 --> 00:30:55,479
you have a sign-in with Apple j/s and

00:30:53,649 --> 00:30:57,099
when you are used in this library this

00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:59,320
is a JavaScript library when you're

00:30:57,099 --> 00:31:00,909
using this library you will be able to

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,450
look in the user with one can week as

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:08,889
well and it will use face IDE or touch

00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:10,719
ID on different devices from your PWA so

00:31:08,889 --> 00:31:14,799
that's something interesting that you

00:31:10,719 --> 00:31:17,289
can use PWA builder it's a suite of

00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:20,720
tools from Microsoft open-source tools

00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:24,650
from Microsoft as they are available

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,250
that PWA bills.com I will mention be

00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:30,230
there a couple of times they have a pwe

00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,590
of web component that we can actually

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,000
use and react so it already it built so

00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:36,920
we just need to import the JavaScript

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,820
library the web component library use

00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:42,920
the o'the tar I'm set some keys and

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,740
that's all I will look like this I mean

00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:48,320
with Microsoft Google Facebook or Apple

00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:51,410
okay so that will help the user to log

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:55,450
in and view all off process that

00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:59,480
sometimes is tricky on PWX

00:31:55,450 --> 00:32:01,760
so another way to integrate your your

00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,790
react application within PWA the

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,800
platform is the web share api with the

00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:09,110
web share api you can share content from

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,710
your app to other apps you are

00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:14,360
integrating into the ecosystem of your

00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:18,710
mobile phone or off your back so by the

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:20,900
way that's so you can actually integrate

00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:22,880
your content there and it's pretty

00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:26,480
simple it's navigator doe chair you pass

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,850
JSON with some data that's all right and

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,610
this is working on Android iOS and also

00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:34,460
next oh so next up there are not so many

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:37,970
share ecosystem so it depends on the US

00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:42,250
but on this is more pretty useful on on

00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:45,860
mobile devices so the web share at the I

00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:48,830
this is the Twitter Peter in the way on

00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:53,270
iOS you can see it's opening the share

00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:55,130
 the native share sheet on iOS ok so

00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,890
and the same happens on on Android as

00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:00,800
well so this is a candidate for a web

00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:02,240
share component okay so um I mean you

00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,970
can create your own component that will

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,960
actually call this API okay so that's

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:11,330
interesting another way this is an

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,120
automatic way actually to integrate to

00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:16,490
the US it's not not where apk a nearly

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:18,920
important part that I have here is that

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:23,300
I need you to be aware of where we

00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:27,020
became when we became its its system

00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:29,390
right now in Android that it's it's a

00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:31,610
satyr with Chrome that will generate an

00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:33,590
apk and implicates are trained Android

00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,010
package it's an Android native package

00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:37,100
so

00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:41,030
in native app so instead of you

00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:43,520
compiling your own app with web apk it's

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,950
going to be created by Google in the

00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:49,340
cloud it's going to be signed by Google

00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:51,980
okay so that means that when you have

00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:55,910
where they decay your app will appear as

00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:58,400
any around you can see it appears in the

00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,560
settings as an app install even there is

00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,140
a fake data here it says that the app

00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:06,200
was installed by the Play Store which is

00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,340
actually false because it wasn't

00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,810
installed by the Play Store but because

00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,860
it was signed by the Play Store the

00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:15,530
phone actually thinks it comes from from

00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,630
Google from Glaser and Samsung also has

00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:19,399
Webley PK when you're using Samsung

00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:25,520
internal browser with a Samsung device

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:27,260
only ok that will work only if the PWA

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,940
correct here passes so if you have the

00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,190
manifest if you have the serviceworker

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:34,070
if you have all the components that you

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:36,290
need it will be a full Android native

00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,230
package with it will contain only the

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:42,200
apps name the icon and the URL shut up

00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:45,470
okay so we won't contain your your react

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:48,590
bundles okay it's just the name of your

00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:51,649
app the icon of the URL the apk will be

00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:53,389
installed silently so that means that

00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:58,370
the user will actually don't actually

00:34:53,389 --> 00:35:00,560
understand the user will not actually

00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:02,930
understand that there is an installation

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,430
from the Play Store going on the icon

00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,320
will go to the home from the launcher

00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:09,500
and this is available on Chrome and

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:14,750
Samsung Internet okay so that's why we

00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:17,030
became on Android we web APK your homes

00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:19,280
will appear everywhere as I mentioned

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,590
before so you will see your icon on all

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,410
the places where typically Android icons

00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:27,830
will appear and one important thing is

00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:30,620
that by default on Android you will have

00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:34,010
political in capturing so within the US

00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:37,100
your PWA will capture all links pointing

00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,610
to your your PWS code meaning that if

00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,700
you have

00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:43,090
twitter.com as your PW a and you receive

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:46,160
a link on whatsapp go into twitter.com

00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:47,960
that link one be opening the browser it

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,510
will all be open in the

00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:54,470
pwe well if it will be one of the

00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:56,150
possible apps okay so if yours if you

00:35:54,470 --> 00:36:00,500
have a PWA and then you're sending

00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:02,810
emails to your user pointing to links to

00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,390
the same domain or the same let's say

00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:08,810
it's a scope is it can be a domain or

00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:10,970
folder you know in your your app will

00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:13,700
actually render that content and not the

00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:16,220
browser okay so be careful just with

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:18,710
that and also now you have Bastion

00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:22,810
available so available on some platforms

00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,810
and you can change it with push message

00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:28,530
but no matter the number or a dot to the

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,650
icon like native apps so I'm talking

00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:34,740
about this I'm talking about that seven

00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,950
that you see there the two okay on

00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:39,690
Windows or on Android it can be just a

00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:42,630
dot Jake something like that so you can

00:36:39,690 --> 00:36:46,260
actually set that in your pwe icon from

00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:49,110
from JavaScript okay so that's also

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:51,120
something new available for PWA

00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:54,780
and finally we have Dexter window

00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:58,070
management which means this Google Drive

00:36:54,780 --> 00:37:01,650
on Google Drive this is a PWA by the way

00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:02,460
you can go to file new no on the Mac for

00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:04,590
example or Linux

00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:07,740
and you can open more windows of your

00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:10,020
PWA so now you can have it's like

00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:14,730
different tabs in the browser but now as

00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:16,860
a standalone apps so even because we

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:20,430
have Glinda's now we can go back to

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:22,890
JavaScript from 1995 and we can use this

00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:24,330
API very actually pretty useless these

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,790
days

00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:30,180
resize chew and move to they actually

00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:32,460
work on on UWA some standalone installed

00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:35,880
PWA so you can actually resize the

00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:39,390
window or or actually organize the

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,550
window or windows within the screen okay

00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,240
with that API so and you can actually

00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:47,850
add these to your bwa confit component

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,280
so every time you start your your app it

00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:51,900
will start in the previous place or in

00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,580
the place or in the size that you

00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:59,370
actually want and you can use the

00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:02,790
service worker as place to actually

00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:04,170
communicate Windows so every window can

00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:06,330
actually communicate with other windows

00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,940
and features look promising for example

00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,830
there is a new API that is coming that

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,100
will let you create apps in this case

00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:14,970
this looks like Google Drive document in

00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,240
different times

00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:21,180
okay and this card is experimenting prom

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,560
it's called mixed up pw8 tap scripts so

00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,620
if you want to play with that it's

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,690
currently available and this is an

00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:32,940
example of a to your experiment we are

00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:35,089
bwa experiment with tab strips and now

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:37,160
we have four levels coming

00:38:35,089 --> 00:38:38,269
okay so foldable devices with different

00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,460
screens

00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:42,289
well there is an expect coming if you

00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:44,869
want to look for it it's the window

00:38:42,289 --> 00:38:48,140
segments enumeration API they'll have

00:38:44,869 --> 00:38:49,729
the CSS part with media queries and also

00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,369
a JavaScript API that will let you

00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:53,989
specify what you want to render on on

00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:57,200
each screen okay

00:38:53,989 --> 00:39:00,229
on iOS unfortunately when you look at io

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,589
s PWA as myself mentioned before the

00:39:00,229 --> 00:39:08,089
first 3d results are actually my

00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:10,099
articles okay so the first one the

00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:12,410
second one and the third one and even

00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:14,900
the Zipit that you hit here is part of

00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,690
another article that I brought so what

00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:22,940
I'm saying here is that this problem for

00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:25,009
um a police truck so Apple is not

00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,869
actually making any documentation on on

00:39:25,009 --> 00:39:29,539
their own platform which is a problem

00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:30,469
okay so I will always say yes many times

00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:33,589
I said this many times

00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:37,029
Apple shame on you right I don't want to

00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:42,109
be your your official documentation okay

00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:49,729
anyway okay so um I'm actually trying to

00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:53,420
see here installation UI so that will

00:39:49,729 --> 00:39:55,339
manifest will is the one that will let

00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:57,680
your react application has those

00:39:55,339 --> 00:40:00,259
installed buttons on many places so

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,440
install on desktop or different icons

00:40:00,259 --> 00:40:05,299
that will let you install the app okay

00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,400
warning for reactives don't use any full

00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:09,829
manifest I already mentioned these don't

00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,099
use me for - understand and set all the

00:40:09,829 --> 00:40:15,829
properties that's really important

00:40:12,099 --> 00:40:17,299
create icons for each platform for iOS 4

00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:20,930
and we different icons not just one

00:40:17,299 --> 00:40:22,579
icons that's work like that on iOS you

00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:24,019
need to actually add icons and splash

00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:26,359
screens to actually have a good

00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:29,359
experience just Google that to actually

00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:31,400
get more info and now it's important you

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,299
need to add masked icons for Android

00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,809
what is this

00:40:32,299 --> 00:40:39,279
by default you can see icons if you

00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:42,469
don't add ask mask icons from Andrei 8

00:40:39,279 --> 00:40:45,140
there is currently 25% of the Android

00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:47,630
users you will see things like this your

00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,670
icon will appear under a circle or a

00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:51,640
different shape

00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:54,910
doesn't look like a nine cycle so um

00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:57,010
that's that's how now you can create a

00:40:54,910 --> 00:41:01,000
multiple icon you can go to mass double

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:02,950
dot app that's a web app that will help

00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,589
you with this you create an icon with a

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:07,599
safe area okay and then different

00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:09,880
Android devices will use in different

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:15,579
shapes will actually use that safe area

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:18,040
and they want like shrink your icon into

00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:23,099
a circle or into another shape so it

00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:25,809
will look like like real real icons so

00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:28,020
many be the video is actually using this

00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:32,619
so time for you to actually go on and

00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:35,200
another this okay so the installation UI

00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:37,420
is that that install button okay that

00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,359
you see there so this is actually can be

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:42,579
different for every a component and a

00:41:40,359 --> 00:41:45,160
lot of examples out there on how to do

00:41:42,579 --> 00:41:47,400
that there is an event before install

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,609
prom that you need to decent for

00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,859
preventing default you will save the

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:56,680
that event for later and then you call

00:41:53,859 --> 00:41:58,329
prompt okay I'm not this is training so

00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,950
I'm not trying to explain everything

00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:03,520
here but it's a kind of running style

00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:05,500
Capone okay we can go back if the event

00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,930
is not fire for example because it's iOS

00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,059
when iOS is not going to be fire you can

00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:12,099
hide the button or you can offer mine

00:42:10,059 --> 00:42:15,369
when instructions when clicked like for

00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:19,089
example on when iOS it will be oops

00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:23,380
sorry it will be go to share archie home

00:42:19,089 --> 00:42:26,200
on on desktop it will be menu install go

00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,210
to a menu in stuff and on android we go

00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,089
to the menu at your home screen okay so

00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:33,940
these are like some explanation how to

00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:36,609
do that um remember PWA builder that I

00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:39,130
mentioned for well PW there is also

00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:41,980
creating a PW install what component

00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:44,920
that is completely JSX compatible okay

00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:48,500
it's called bwa installed and it's open

00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:53,450
source okay cool

00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:58,130
good so let me see we're doing with time

00:42:53,450 --> 00:43:01,580
I think we need to start moving on so

00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:03,770
I'm going directly to one of the most

00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,840
important part for me that is AB

00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:10,040
distribution there are many things okay

00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:11,750
it can be here for hours but today you

00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:14,780
can distribute your app in the browser

00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:15,170
in the enterprise world and your app

00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:18,260
store

00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:20,119
okay on all the submission models we are

00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,700
not changing how the resources of the

00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:24,260
app are being installed and updated the

00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:27,530
service worker is responsible for that

00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:32,540
on every on every posted okay it's

00:43:27,530 --> 00:43:33,890
always a service worker today we can

00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,530
create native apps that we know how to

00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:40,490
do that hybrid apps and PWA launchers

00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:44,060
and that's new okay so a BWI launcher is

00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,980
one of the three ways that we have to

00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,050
distribute an app so we have a web app

00:43:45,980 --> 00:43:49,970
react application a service worker and

00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:52,520
we're going to create a launcher you say

00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:55,460
lunch what's that it's just a package an

00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,369
empty package that will launch your PWA

00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:02,060
in a stand alone mode on different words

00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:03,890
so on different operating systems so the

00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:08,690
launcher will contain the icon and the

00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:13,430
name metadata let's start the URL of

00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:17,720
your PWA that's no resources will be

00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:20,089
stored here okay and then you can use

00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,339
the app store because some users will

00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:23,869
look there you wanna increase reach and

00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:26,150
you want to use some native features

00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:29,420
notable around the weather okay

00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:31,550
should play we have several know why

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:35,630
that icon watch there from the beginning

00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:37,540
but several stores compatible with pwn

00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:40,400
launchers like Google Play Store the

00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:42,080
Samsung Galaxy store Microsoft Store and

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,720
the kaya store so these stores are

00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,060
actually compatible with PW launcher so

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,190
in this case the same pw8 that you

00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,410
created for the browser can be wrapped

00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:54,080
in a launcher and you go to the store

00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:55,460
and then the user will open the app and

00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,830
you look like any other app in the store

00:44:55,460 --> 00:45:01,950
the user will never know it's actually a

00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:04,290
bit of a Oh or web-based okay there

00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,990
many ways to do this I will try to show

00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:10,260
you adjust the simplest way to do this

00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:14,040
so after you have an account example

00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:17,070
here of an app that was highlighted by

00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,500
Google it's called all your light ok

00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,619
Horschel light so you can see it's just

00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:24,780
less than one megabyte in the Play Store

00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:26,760
okay it has a good rating better

00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:28,470
compression increment blah blah blah

00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:31,380
blah so it works like a real good app

00:45:28,470 --> 00:45:34,500
and it's just a PWA I'm not sure if

00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:38,130
that's react or not but it can be there

00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:40,589
is no reason not and for Samsung today

00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:42,119
is if you wanna publish a PWA in the

00:45:40,589 --> 00:45:44,099
Samsung Play Store you just need to send

00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:48,510
an email it's kind of a manual thing

00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:50,849
today but it's there and now Google is

00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:52,800
also replacing Android apps in Chrome OS

00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:56,010
with web apps so that's that's new from

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,570
from last last week so now if you go to

00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:58,859
if you have a Chromebook and you go to

00:45:57,570 --> 00:46:00,540
the Play Store and download Twitter

00:45:58,859 --> 00:46:03,150
you're not actually downloaded an

00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:07,260
Android app it's actually installing the

00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:09,599
PWA ok if you're gonna create without

00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:13,470
getting into technical we can get into

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,390
later in slack if you want or the QA you

00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:18,930
can if you wanna create one app launcher

00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:23,200
for entry for the Placer us tell you

00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:26,230
have your pw8 published you can

00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,960
which PWB that one solution

00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:30,430
another one is okay so you keep the URL

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:34,450
of your video anyway and you will give

00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:36,970
you an epic a hundred package and for

00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:39,819
Apple it's only available for

00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:42,010
enterprises your mission okay but you

00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:44,410
can actually create web clips with the

00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:46,569
URL of your PW away and you can

00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:49,180
distribute into your enterprise users

00:46:46,569 --> 00:46:53,200
for your company your Peter you and then

00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:55,380
on eustress devices the the icon of your

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,359
PW a will appear so I think that's

00:46:55,380 --> 00:47:00,220
that's actually pretty pretty cool just

00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:03,490
have in mine and I'm finishing with this

00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:06,549
that you should be very careful because

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:09,880
not every PWA can be in the store for

00:47:06,549 --> 00:47:11,530
example one of the most distributed pwh

00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:15,309
today is that one I'm not sure how many

00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:17,470
of you recognize that logo that YP that

00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:22,210
YPG logo is the bitter area ready for

00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:24,400
you porn you porn is a PWA okay and of

00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:26,020
course they cannot be in the App Store

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,589
okay because the App Store has some

00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:32,440
rules in fact this was from this week

00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:35,470
from yesterday in fact so someone so

00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:38,440
that they are bwa in the Play Store was

00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:42,430
rejected because was an app for kids

00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:45,490
what kids gaming or up for kids are not

00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:48,910
actually a long win you to use a website

00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:51,670
or a bitter in your content okay so the

00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,230
App Store has rules so check the store

00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:56,549
rules okay if you want to be severe

00:47:53,230 --> 00:48:00,760
Europe you react up in the in stores

00:47:56,549 --> 00:48:03,369
okay so the last thing I have for you is

00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:05,589
that not every app should be a bit early

00:48:03,369 --> 00:48:08,200
right I'm not saying that but there are

00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:11,200
a lot of apps be appear anyway I created

00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:13,930
it video I come for that should be PWA

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:17,049
so some sometimes I'm tweeting about

00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:19,359
some up side see in the market that are

00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:21,700
currently not pwace but this should be

00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:24,960
and I try to explain why it's it's it's

00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:27,220
better and I think that was all just

00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,480
reminder that you to more dates you and

00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:36,540
I gave my free my free course on on pure

00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:40,560
açaí I think thank you

00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:45,440
now we can go over Q&A now sir do you

00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:48,930
wanna take over yes can you hear me yep

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:52,740
wonderful so we have five questions and

00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:54,360
directly in the Q&A so let's run through

00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,280
them I think you partially answered all

00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:58,320
of them but hearing them in context of

00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,510
the question is probably going to be

00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,270
helpful for the people who asked so

00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:05,790
annual is asking the offline requirement

00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:08,100
has always made me curious does it mean

00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:11,250
that for example a chat app can never be

00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:13,560
classified as a PWA okay that's a good

00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:15,390
question so the answer is that think

00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:20,040
about the native chat application think

00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:22,740
about whatsapp or telegram so you open

00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,990
Braun you don't have connection you but

00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:29,370
you don't have culture you don't see

00:49:24,990 --> 00:49:31,170
where this is insane that that is not

00:49:29,370 --> 00:49:35,130
working but like there is no connection

00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:38,280
the app appears okay so the app reacts

00:49:35,130 --> 00:49:42,720
so what you actually need is that your

00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:46,260
app should react okay so how it depends

00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:49,830
on on the on the app to be honest okay

00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:52,050
so but the app should react with its own

00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:54,510
user interface and that part is offline

00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:57,480
then you make the business decision of

00:49:54,510 --> 00:50:00,210
which features will be available while

00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,880
offline okay let's up to you but at

00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:06,740
least you actually need content served

00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:06,740
from your app when it's of life

00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:17,859
I think your mute or solo no I'm not

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:19,809
hearing you for some reason okay cool

00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:21,130
well thank you very much then hopefully

00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:23,130
that answer your question if it didn't

00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:26,289
please feel free to add additional

00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:31,210
addendum this is a curious one for me so

00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:33,160
it so it's some sort of sentence phrases

00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:35,200
a question I get so it will be an

00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:43,749
asynchronous chat app when the connects

00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:46,630
off so understand the question but let's

00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:49,119
see this this way there are some

00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:51,430
platforms for example next or an Android

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:54,279
mainly it's an old iOS where you can

00:50:51,430 --> 00:50:55,599
actually run code in the background even

00:50:54,279 --> 00:50:56,289
if the user is not actually using your

00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:00,430
PWA

00:50:56,289 --> 00:51:02,589
when the connection restarts so your

00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:04,930
pyramid your chat pwe application on

00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:08,440
android next can actually send messages

00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:11,380
in the background even if so actually

00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:14,950
even if it's frozen right now okay

00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:17,380
on iOS you will only be able to send

00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,299
that those messages that are bending

00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,489
when the user goes back to the up later

00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:26,259
mm-hmm there is a restriction on the

00:51:21,489 --> 00:51:28,239
block yeah I guess this says this it has

00:51:26,259 --> 00:51:30,009
to do with the entire function a change

00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,839
of functionality of being a synchronous

00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:32,980
so you might lose your connection for

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:35,140
something you might use you have a

00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,940
little bit you so there is an API

00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:38,170
exactly there is an API there is some

00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:40,869
type of service worker known as

00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:44,170
background sync that will let you

00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:46,210
actually send messages or receive

00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:48,880
messages in the background to sync the

00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,980
data in the background so it doesn't

00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,630
matter is getting out of the app so it's

00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:54,549
not actually part of the life cycle of

00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:57,279
the app do you things giving out of the

00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:58,809
app cause as we mentioned before that

00:51:57,279 --> 00:52:01,299
message messages in the background sync

00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:05,049
API will also be fired and now we have

00:52:01,299 --> 00:52:07,690
us a big sink API with users permission

00:52:05,049 --> 00:52:08,769
you can you can actually execute some

00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:12,700
codes in the background

00:52:08,769 --> 00:52:14,410
every morning so update your app or

00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,930
rather your content with users

00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:18,519
permission now we're so the next thing

00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,200
brings it very close to what a native

00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:21,380
app would normally be doing yeah a

00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:23,270
ground or

00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:26,050
there is a there is a limit limit also

00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:29,470
that uses the chromium project okay has

00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:32,180
its own mission of the future of the web

00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:35,930
there is a person on a fugu the fugu

00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:38,600
brush a fugu refugia the fugu pressure

00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:41,090
the idea is to bring every native

00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,220
capability into the web and the PWA

00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:46,790
platform so they're adding you might be

00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:48,500
eyes every month based on that idea that

00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:51,230
every capability should also be

00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,940
available with security and privacy the

00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:56,240
development and they should be a bit

00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:58,670
around the world ever saw okay so

00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,190
another question from Dan UK assuming

00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:03,350
it's not a different K and in the last

00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:05,930
name so assuming I don't need app stores

00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:08,510
and sums its mobile specific a API which

00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:10,880
you recommend PWA as a cheap option for

00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:14,710
developing such or do you think real

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,710
native app has some important benefits

00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:24,050
so regarding cheap so I mean compared to

00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:26,660
the idea of creating two native apps iOS

00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:28,640
and Android probably is cheaper but it's

00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:30,500
not so cheap creating it could be there

00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,360
anyway because you need to create a good

00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:34,910
PWA that means performance

00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:36,230
yes experience it's not just by oh it's

00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:39,290
because it's a website no one is doing

00:53:36,230 --> 00:53:41,660
QA I don't care okay because if not the

00:53:39,290 --> 00:53:43,370
user will not actually use your so a bit

00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:46,070
earlier a should actually be performin

00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:48,440
and that needs some work on some

00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,520
experience so I'm not sure it's also

00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:54,080
cheap

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:55,790
so what ICS is where when should we

00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:58,100
should be using PWX and when we

00:53:55,790 --> 00:54:00,890
shouldn't I think it has to do with

00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:03,110
ability so if you're bwa can be created

00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:08,120
with the PWA platform then it should be

00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:12,170
created because it will be available

00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:13,970
everywhere on every platform but yeah if

00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:16,340
you have performance issues because I

00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:18,170
know you're doing something very weird

00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:20,030
and you actually need but now you have

00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,860
also well assembly so even when you say

00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:23,480
I need native code and eighty

00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:28,250
performance we can actually have

00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:32,390
webassembly now that is like as fast as

00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:34,420
can be so there are a lot of situations

00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:35,470
were bitterly raising good platform

00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:37,920
and there are a lot of situations where

00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:40,890
it's not so I agreed I'm not saying like

00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:44,230
it's the only tool that we have

00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:47,530
yeah so the question was asked with sort

00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:49,660
of quotes in it so cheap as in is it a

00:54:47,530 --> 00:54:51,520
cheap option but true yeah absolutely so

00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:53,440
I guess this is with building anything

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,809
you you always always hear like there's

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,780
a cheaper version but really cheapness

00:54:55,809 --> 00:54:59,470
is coming out of your moving the cost

00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:04,000
somewhere else

00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:07,900
mm-hmm so next one is from civilian Oh

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:09,790
Pocoyo so to create it a PWA with react

00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:13,089
the approach is to use react natively

00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:15,220
for web or react web for mobile it's

00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:18,309
better to adapt mobile for web or web to

00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,480
mobile a UI perspective so I started

00:55:18,309 --> 00:55:25,299
from the web or a starting for the

00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:27,700
mobile sort of so I mean I think that

00:55:25,299 --> 00:55:31,150
you will use react native for web only

00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:33,490
if you really need or want to create

00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:36,299
native app for the stores mostly on iOS

00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:38,799
where you cannot polish your PWA

00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:41,380
manually so you say well I do react

00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:44,740
native well for iOS and then react

00:55:41,380 --> 00:55:48,640
native for web and that's the only

00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:50,619
reason so if you are if you're if your

00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:53,380
focus is on PWA

00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:58,690
I don't think you will start with react

00:55:53,380 --> 00:56:00,190
native ask use react which is yeah so

00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:03,400
just look at the question again like it

00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:06,160
maybe maybe it's the question isn't it

00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:08,770
like because it's what he's saying is

00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:12,790
you use react native for web or react

00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:15,099
web fernette for mobile so I think it's

00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:18,910
reaction yes versus react native yeah

00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:22,470
but that but again it's like if you're

00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,470
going to create just pwace

00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:31,060
but you would have a little forward load

00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:32,770
that I don't think you need or want you

00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:35,680
you also help flatter examples rather

00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:37,390
for well it's also available and you can

00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:38,590
wait to be there good for a while but if

00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:41,470
you have a web developer and you're on

00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:43,990
the web side of the world getting the

00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:46,480
getting into that space chefs you create

00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:50,170
for our content you won't be too happy

00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:52,120
about it I think we all lose control so

00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:54,790
yeah yeah absolutely

00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,250
um that make sense so yeah another

00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:59,710
question from Daniel this one's very

00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,790
simple so can you share your size slides

00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:03,820
please there was a lot of useful

00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:04,990
information mention yeah sure yeah I can

00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,660
share it in with your account I can

00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,100
share with the organizers and I'm

00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:12,970
probably in looks like we can also put

00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:16,210
it in their sub manager cool and final

00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:18,850
questions over here is from Sergei if we

00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:21,820
distribute the PW wave by App Store and

00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:23,650
Google Play how does how oh oh as

00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,680
determines which browser engine to use

00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:27,580
okay so this way which one is used no no

00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:31,990
that's a good question

00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:34,420
so um explain that but for for going to

00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:36,370
the Play Store today with pwace there is

00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:39,460
a technology known as trusted web

00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:42,760
activities cwy trusted one of the it's

00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:45,340
started something from chrome only to

00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,550
something as a chrome API but now it's

00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:52,600
part of an agnostic protocol on Android

00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:55,540
so it means that if the user has more

00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:58,300
than one browser support in TW ice-t's

00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:00,340
so trusted web activities the user will

00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:03,400
receive like the first time opening and

00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:06,460
ipw a you will will be asked which

00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,870
browser when I use with rendering engine

00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:10,000
do you want to use something like that

00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:12,400
okay just remember that it's not so

00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,190
common for for end user to actually have

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,680
more than one browser okay so it's not a

00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:19,270
common situation it's more for ask but

00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:24,390
they're testing and we have a lot of

00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:27,940
browsers so today it's it's mainly

00:58:24,390 --> 00:58:29,950
mainly been opening in chrome but as

00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:32,140
more browser for supporting these

00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:35,770
technologies they can actually be

00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:37,420
providers of pwace so then it depends on

00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:38,510
the configuration of your phone so if

00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:40,490
you home does have chrome

00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:42,500
and you have only Firefox in fact we

00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:45,530
supporting trusted web activities then

00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:47,630
it will use Firefox okay so it's

00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:49,460
basically a user's choice of what they

00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:51,560
wanted to do it's fairly rare because

00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,869
most people just use whatever yeah and

00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,650
it's also rare to find use of the

00:58:53,869 --> 00:59:01,550
directory in this town what's going on

00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:02,840
so this is a question here but it's as

00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:06,650
we're going through the presentation I

00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:08,840
kept asking so why isn't Apple really on

00:59:06,650 --> 00:59:10,760
board here like we see all these others

00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:13,850
even like these tiny little you know key

00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:17,900
phones with kos supporting it why is

00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:21,350
Apple so either problematic or just not

00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:25,690
using even the term PW at all so I don't

00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:31,820
know so so I have my eye the particle

00:59:25,690 --> 00:59:35,690
the money in 20 try saying the latest

00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:40,130
article on medium so where I collect a

00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:42,859
couple of things from Apple so I will

00:59:40,130 --> 00:59:45,800
have these two two strikes

00:59:42,859 --> 00:59:48,670
okay the the Safari team there is

00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:54,170
actually improving the technology behind

00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:56,660
the PWA platform so slowly but they're

00:59:54,170 --> 00:59:58,970
actually they're the service workers

00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:01,310
okay they're actually there and the

00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:04,070
other side it's actually saying no we

01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:06,820
know what we don't want the mission from

01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:09,260
chromium from chrome that we should

01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:12,290
entice the web with more power

01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:15,770
okay so the early ways are actually

01:00:12,290 --> 01:00:16,490
working on iOS at least the basic ok

01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,950
it's working

01:00:16,490 --> 01:00:21,920
sometimes buggy now it's much better

01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:23,510
than before so it's always the question

01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:25,220
that there art of people angry me and

01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:29,119
developers angry with Apple because of

01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:31,640
the a is so sometimes the feeling is

01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:36,800
like they won app help but they they

01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:38,000
have them they have like BWA worries for

01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:41,450
being their truck for them or something

01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:45,109
like that so yeah every mention to that

01:00:41,450 --> 01:00:47,510
is like we don't actually wanna do the

01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:49,300
same as Google but it's also true the

01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:52,869
duel has a lot of power in the web today

01:00:49,300 --> 01:00:54,249
so it's mostly

01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:57,220
so if you take couple out of the

01:00:54,249 --> 01:00:58,839
equation you have only maybe Firefox

01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:02,440
with get-go but it's not really so

01:00:58,839 --> 01:01:06,700
powerful to save there even if it's not

01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:10,299
actually chromium for now at least it's

01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:12,279
actually following Google okay so it's

01:01:10,299 --> 01:01:16,630
everyone that is actually doing what

01:01:12,279 --> 01:01:20,769
Google says and the in-sample so I don't

01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:22,359
have this anti Apple view okay so I I'm

01:01:20,769 --> 01:01:24,700
I'm angry with Apple because they're not

01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:26,200
doing it the things that they will be

01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:29,500
doing

01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,810
but also it's important to have the

01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,490
balance and saying well the other hand

01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:35,860
it's also true that everyone else is

01:01:33,490 --> 01:01:40,300
doing what we want so do we say there is

01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:43,120
no real competition so I don't know so I

01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:45,340
don't know I mean I'm not an employee so

01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:49,150
I've been there doing trainings that's a

01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:51,160
trainer okay in Cupertino people it's

01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:53,110
just people everywhere they're not that

01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:56,080
the evil people keep working there so

01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:59,980
but yeah they're cooperate ideas are

01:01:56,080 --> 01:02:02,110
different than other companies and they

01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:04,210
have their priorities and they say this

01:02:02,110 --> 01:02:07,900
is not a priority for us unfortunately

01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:10,690
right so so I don't know the reason so

01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:13,390
we can just yes so we can assume we can

01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:15,610
ask about the reason but we don't

01:02:13,390 --> 01:02:16,870
actually know for sure of course of

01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:18,490
course I mean it's kind of it's kind of

01:02:16,870 --> 01:02:20,110
a paradox because really like the first

01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:21,460
time you know I already mentioned that

01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:23,440
you mentioned it the first time so that

01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:27,400
that vision was presented to the world

01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:29,980
was at an Apple conference or an Apple

01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:31,810
executive so it's almost like you know

01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,850
the way they pulled out the disk drive

01:02:31,810 --> 01:02:35,140
of everything you know years before

01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:36,850
everybody else figured out like that

01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,130
might be a good idea to make the laptop

01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:42,970
smaller then maybe just come in and then

01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:45,520
you know do what they want so cool well

01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:51,820
looks like we don't have any further

01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:52,420
questions from from on the Q&A nor the

01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,310
chat

01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:56,980
I think Daniel only pointed out that

01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:59,650
there's a website called what web can do

01:02:56,980 --> 01:03:01,510
that today I think you also mentioned in

01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:03,730
your course maybe you can talk a little

01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:05,770
bit about that and what that does oh

01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:07,920
there are a couple of websites oh I even

01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:10,510
mentioned that why France I remember but

01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:13,810
so there are a lot of websites it's just

01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:18,850
a list of features that will tell you

01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:22,720
like like green yellow red per feature

01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:25,240
okay so you know if it's safe to use or

01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,940
or maybe yeah maybe this is working only

01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:29,470
off Firefox for Android and say oh it's

01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:31,780
just three were those five percent of

01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,490
the users yeah it's there we can play

01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:36,040
with it but it's not actually ready for

01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:38,440
production so this website will give you

01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:40,960
yeah what what you can actually do on

01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,510
the web today and what it's not actually

01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,910
ready yet yeah this is like back in the

01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:47,950
day when html5 was just you know a big

01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:49,450
dream and they had those works like Oh

01:03:47,950 --> 01:03:52,210
operandi was important but chrome

01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:54,030
doesn't yeah so actually that but but in

01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:57,370
a high-level overview of features

01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:58,300
absolutely absolutely well it was a

01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,830
wonderful presentation

01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:03,010
and I think we had positive feedback

01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:05,230
also here in the chat it was really

01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:07,630
interesting to listen I you know

01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:10,750
definitely check out Mac this course on

01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:12,400
a floral site it's really interesting

01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:15,220
sort of goes deeper into some of the

01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,750
topics he talked about today and in cake

01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:18,610
people want to find you work and they

01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:20,110
thank you where can they reach you where

01:04:18,610 --> 01:04:23,560
can they find them more about whether

01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:26,530
it's twitter fi RT or in my web site if

01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:29,380
i RT dot movie I will press that in the

01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:32,520
chat panel you have a lot of videos in

01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:35,260
YouTube from previous talks books and

01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:38,530
courses links to different quarry so

01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:39,190
that's like the place where you can find

01:04:38,530 --> 01:04:42,190
my content

01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:43,540
wonderful well thank you so much we're

01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:45,580
gonna have the slack channel set up

01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:47,950
after this so for those who want to ask

01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:49,480
me deeper more technical questions or

01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:51,910
even just additional questions that they

01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:54,670
you didn't have a chance to ask here we

01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:58,750
can do that we have another great

01:04:54,670 --> 01:05:00,550
presentation max from Oreo and also says

01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:02,740
I found that I don't get any benefits

01:05:00,550 --> 01:05:05,140
using PWA I've just rather use a

01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,370
bookmark and if I need any notification

01:05:05,140 --> 01:05:11,020
I use another type of notification

01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:12,460
channel any any feedback for that or no

01:05:11,020 --> 01:05:16,570
but it made that's fine because but

01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:19,390
that's I think that's sometimes more of

01:05:16,570 --> 01:05:22,330
a geeky you I mean another end user and

01:05:19,390 --> 01:05:23,950
users wants apps so they want an app

01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:26,590
installed with an icon in the home

01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:29,710
screen so it's it's kind of they don't

01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:32,920
think on URLs I mean end users so that's

01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:34,810
why I apps are everywhere so pwace is -

01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:38,380
but but one of the great things about

01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:40,180
PWA is that you can choose so you can

01:05:38,380 --> 01:05:42,280
use the PWA in the browser you can

01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:44,530
install it and remember that video is

01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:47,110
not just installation it's also the

01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:49,030
performance and the offline things that

01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:49,839
you can get with service workers and

01:05:49,030 --> 01:05:53,710
that was

01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:56,229
a level before okay so we would work so

01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:57,969
the performance though for rendering

01:05:56,229 --> 01:05:59,529
content locally or serving content

01:05:57,969 --> 01:06:03,130
locally instead of going to the server

01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:06,160
for every request yeah it's been much

01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:07,359

01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:09,609
