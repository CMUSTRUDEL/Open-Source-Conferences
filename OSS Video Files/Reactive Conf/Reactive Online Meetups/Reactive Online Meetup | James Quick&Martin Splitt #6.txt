Technical SEO for modern web apps

𝗧𝗔𝗟𝗞 𝗔𝗕𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗖𝗧
When we build web apps, we want people to use them. One of the biggest sources for new users is search engines. But what about web apps built with modern web frameworks? Do we need SEO? What can we developers do to make our web apps findable and what goes into technical SEO? Let's walk through an example!

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:31,830

you very much sure thing so what's more

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:58,230
to say the stage is yours I'm looking

00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:02,150
forward how I will unstuck myself good

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:05,760
yeah awesome okay let me share my screen

00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:08,209
cool all right let me start my timer to

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:14,909
make sure that I'm on time and then yeah

00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:17,579
ready to go so for me growing up my

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:20,519
family spent most of their time feeling

00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:21,900
stuck in their careers and honestly I

00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,730
think most of the time they wouldn't

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,060
even consider themselves to have careers

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,220
they might have had jobs but not careers

00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,930
see for my family job was just a job it

00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,700
was something necessary to support their

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,099
family something necessary to put food

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:38,310
on the table not necessarily something

00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,919
associated with happiness and this is

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,599
especially true for my dad he was one of

00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:45,329
the smartest people that I've ever met

00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,010
he got his law degree he practiced law

00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:49,530
for a while and he realized that he

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,239
didn't enjoy it and so he quit and this

00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:53,819
was kind of noble the idea of leaving

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,139
something that you don't quite enjoy to

00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,139
go and find something that makes you

00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,150
happier the problem was he didn't end up

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:02,970
sacrificing that career as a lawyer for

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:05,730
happiness ultimately he just never found

00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:08,040
either he never seemed like he had a job

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,109
that he enjoyed he never seemed like he

00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,560
was on a path to somewhere and he never

00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:15,209
really made any money so this talk is

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,489
about some of the ups and downs that

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,449
I've dealt with as a professional and I

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,430
want to share with you some of the

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,410
things that I've learned in the hopes

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,080
that you can use them to strive towards

00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:28,110
happiness in your life in your career

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,550
whatever that may look like for you

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,770
so this story is gonna start out at the

00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:33,210
beginning of my career I started my

00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:37,020
career at Microsoft fresh out of college

00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:40,650
and my job was a Technical Evangelist my

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,500
job was to get out in speak and give

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,629
presentations and workshops and so at

00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,460
the age of 22 I found myself giving

00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,250
presentations to audiences full of

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:53,099
developers many of whom had been writing

00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,389
code longer than I had been alive and as

00:04:53,099 --> 00:04:56,159
you can imagine this is a pretty

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:57,870
uncomfortable feeling for me and I

00:04:56,159 --> 00:05:00,840
suffered a lot from impostor syndrome

00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:03,270
I wondered what can I possibly offer

00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,680
someone who's been writing code for 20

00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:07,590
plus years maybe longer than I've been

00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,340
alive if I've just recently graduated

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:12,870
from college myself but the more I did

00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,550
this the more talks that I gave I

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,979
started to realize that people were

00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:18,689
showing up to hear me speak because

00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,639
there was something that I knew that

00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,039
they didn't that they wanted to come and

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,189
learn from me and I started to build up

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,830
a lot of confidence and at the end of my

00:05:26,189 --> 00:05:31,319
first year in my review with my manager

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,330
who I really enjoyed working with I got

00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:35,009
a glowing review and that led to a

00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,370
pretty big bonus and at that point it

00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:40,440
was time to celebrate and so I took the

00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:43,110
money that I got in that bonus from that

00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,940
first year and I bought a ring so

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:46,710
proposed to my wife I'd used that ring

00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,030
to then propose to my wife and I got

00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,220
married about a year later

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,600
and with all this confidence and so many

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,920
cool things happening in my life I

00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,440
started to think about what happiness

00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:57,940
looked like in my career and I realized

00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,920
there was one thing in particular that I

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,440
was missing I had always had this dream

00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,690
of living in New York City my wife and I

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,790
had visited a couple times in college we

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,990
were just infatuated with the city and

00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,080
that was something that ultimately I

00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:12,850
wanted to do so I mentioned that to my

00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,860
manager I was in South Florida at the

00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:18,160
time and there just happened to be

00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,710
someone that left the team in New York

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,080
City so three weeks later my wife and I

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,510
moved to New York this is actually the

00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,550
view from our rooftop in Brooklyn

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:32,350
overlooking the New York City skyline

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:34,540
and so with that move came a new

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,830
surroundings obviously a new team and

00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:39,550
then also a new manager and

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:41,260
unfortunately I never felt like that

00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,730
manager was really paying attention to

00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,460
me and I'll give you a couple of

00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:47,320
examples why during our one-on-one he

00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,900
would often be getting food through the

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,740
drive-thru at McDonald's or he would be

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,030
picking up coffee at Starbucks and I

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,550
just felt like he was never really

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,290
paying attention to me

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,610
so fast forward to the end of my career

00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:03,190
at Microsoft about a year and a half

00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:05,130
later when I had my final review with my

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,270
manager and I was going into it

00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:09,340
anticipating I had done my job and I'd

00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,110
done my job well and I expected my

00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,460
review and my bonus to kind of correlate

00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:14,140
to that just kind of right in the middle

00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,930
like I did as good as anybody else kind

00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,810
of thing and when I got my bonus

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:22,210
I was shocked it was significantly lower

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,490
than what I expected and to make matters

00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:26,890
worse my manager couldn't articulate to

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,390
me why he didn't he couldn't say you

00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,430
didn't do this or you didn't do this

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:32,740
well enough or in comparison to the team

00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,030
you didn't do these things well and he

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:35,620
never really said any of that stuff

00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,470
throughout the year as well so this was

00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:40,930
a complete shock and so I felt hurt and

00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:44,080
I felt shocked and most importantly I

00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,930
felt like everything about the situation

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,150
was out of my control and I realized two

00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,880
really important things during that one

00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:54,520
is that no matter how good or bad your

00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,870
manager is ultimately what you do with

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,390
your career and where you go in your

00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,860
career is up to you you have to be your

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,050
own conductor wherever it is that you

00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,360
want to go it's on you to get there you

00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,710
can

00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,180
we have helped along the way and you can

00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:09,530
have people that may not help you so

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:10,849
much but ultimately it's up to you and -

00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,419
I realize that I should have been more

00:08:10,849 --> 00:08:13,069
vocal

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:14,569
I should have been asking more direct

00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:16,699
questions I should have been asking

00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:18,800
questions more frequently I shouldn't

00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:22,689
have let myself be in a situation to be

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,689
surprised when that final review came

00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:26,759
so you might be wondering I mentioned

00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,199
that was at the end of my career at

00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,440
Microsoft you might be wondering why I

00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,710
left a company at Microsoft one of the

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,930
top tech companies in the world and what

00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:39,990
I haven't explained yet is that in May

00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:42,180
of 2016 standing on that same rooftop in

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,670
Brooklyn overlooking the New York City

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,870
skyline my dad had called me and told me

00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,650
that he was diagnosed with cancer and

00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:51,600
had six months to live and my wife and I

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,980
at this time had already been talking a

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,910
little bit about what the next stage in

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,950
our life was gonna be

00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,410
we knew New York City was enough for

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:00,930
everything we wanted to buy a house and

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,339
kind of settle down so we decided we

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,589
would move to Memphis and I would be

00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,490
able to spend what time my dad had left

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:10,709
with him as part of that process

00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,270
I was looking internally at Microsoft to

00:09:10,709 --> 00:09:13,620
see if I could find some sort of role

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,690
that would make sense for me to do in

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,630
Memphis and long story short it just

00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:21,240
didn't work out so I had in turn

00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,620
previously in college at FedEx and I

00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,000
reached out to my previous manager and

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,680
said hey I'm moving to Memphis I would

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,260
love to come work at FedEx and she said

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,640
well this is perfect timing because we

00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:31,290
are about to hire several positions

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,080
because we've got a lot of work that

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,459
needs to be done and so it seemed like

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,020
everything was kind of coming together

00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:42,000
and was gonna work out relatively okay

00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:43,860
but it didn't quite go as expected when

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,709
I moved to Memphis my dad passed away

00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,450
about a week later so I thought I was

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:50,010
gonna have four to five months time to

00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,600
spend with him I only got a week and I'm

00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,920
very thankful for that time but at the

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,630
end of the day it wasn't quite what I

00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,720
expected and then to the process to

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,470
start the interviews at FedEx took a lot

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,730
longer than I ever expected so when my

00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,320
dad passed away there was a lot of

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,850
logistical things a lot of emotional

00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,680
things well a lot of logistical things

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,350
that came down to me to take care of my

00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,940
mom and passed away a few years before

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,700
so I had a house to take care of to

00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,190
clean out I had a car to put in my name

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,050
and I had all these things to figure out

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,520
and so a month or two after that my wife

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:26,070
started to ask me hey have you heard

00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,360
anything from FedEx and I would say I'm

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,370
just waiting on them to tell me when the

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,690
interview is and a month later she would

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,329
say the same thing and I would say the

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,160
same thing back to her and then a month

00:10:33,329 --> 00:10:35,779
after that she said you know how we like

00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,579
to have food

00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,319
and wear clothes and all these things

00:10:37,579 --> 00:10:43,519
those things cost money have you heard

00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:45,769
anything from FedEx and I realized that

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,600
I couldn't control how quickly I was

00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:50,089
able to have the interview with FedEx

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,740
but what I could control was being damn

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:53,930
sure that I was as prepared for the

00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,600
interview as I could possibly be when it

00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:58,399
did come so I started investing in

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,350
myself I started watching YouTube videos

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,600
I started taking you to me courses I

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,620
started building portfolios and projects

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,149
and I started hanging out in the

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,089
community and investing in the people

00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:10,999
around me and a couple of months later I

00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:12,199
had my interview with FedEx and I talked

00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,809
about all those things that I've been

00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:16,009
working on and learning and I didn't

00:11:14,809 --> 00:11:17,509
know this at the time but the people who

00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,220
interviewed me walked away from the

00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:23,870
interview saying there's no doubt we

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:27,110
absolutely want to hire that person so

00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:28,459
looking back I realized with all the

00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:31,430
emotional things that were going on in

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,019
my life at the time from a career

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:34,519
standpoint I needed to focus on the

00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:35,990
things that I could control again I

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,610
couldn't control when that interview

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,649
would come I couldn't control when they

00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,629
would call me about the interview but I

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,509
could control how prepared I was for the

00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:47,449
interview at the time and I was and I

00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:51,949
ended up getting the job and I started

00:11:47,449 --> 00:11:55,339
my new career at FedEx and when I joined

00:11:51,949 --> 00:11:57,259
FedEx they talked a lot about something

00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:59,809
called safe and safe stands for the

00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:02,120
scaled agile framework it's basically a

00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:04,009
framework around how to do agile at

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,560
really big companies and scaled agile

00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:07,480
framework

00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,480
and the way this worked is there was

00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,980
five two-week sprints and during that

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,010
fifth one you're supposed to plan for

00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,140
the next five and then go and execute

00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:19,000
and then come back and plan and kind of

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,320
iterate on that and that fifth sprint is

00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,140
actually called the innovation and

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,400
planning sprint the IP spre and so what

00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:27,220
you're supposed to do is definitely plan

00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,860
but you're also supposed to be embracing

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,779
innovation and everyone at FedEx was

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:33,970
talking about how we should be doing

00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,730
hackathons and we should be learning and

00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,970
experimenting and being creative and I

00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,320
realized that no one was doing that so

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,880
in one of our planning events in a

00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,820
roomful of not quite this many people

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:48,670
but 60 or 70 people I stood up and I

00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,500
said hey we talked about this no one's

00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:54,100
actually doing this at all

00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:56,350
I would like to try something and so I

00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,300
ended up getting support to have either

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,790
two or three days depending on the

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,620
activity to have a hackathon during this

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,240
eyepiece front so that people could have

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,490
a free space to get away from their

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,350
regular desk to be creative to

00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,260
experiment to build to learn new things

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:13,150
and really kind of push the envelope of

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,589
our knowledge in terms of technology at

00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,110
FedEx and that led to some pretty cool

00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:19,930
stuff we got to work with some IOT stuff

00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,400
and we built like a demo that we were

00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,589
able to show off to the entire group and

00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,020
with that as this started to get more

00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:27,550
more more momentum I got a lot of

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:29,230
positive feedback especially from upper

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,650
management congratulations great job

00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:34,300
kudos well done all that kind of stuff

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:36,490
but the thing that really stood out is

00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,800
someone saying thank you for being vocal

00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,110
and I looked back on my experience at

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,510
Microsoft in thinking back about how I

00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,190
wasn't vocal with my manager at the time

00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,900
and I realized that I had now taken

00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,760
something that I had learned in the past

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,860
and applied it to my new role and was

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,360
getting lots of appreciation and

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:54,160
recognition and respect from my peers

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,209
and my management and upper management

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,459
so a couple of months later my manager

00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:02,920
had a career discussion with me she

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,080
wanted to know between two different

00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,390
paths becoming going in the management

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,790
route or contribute or continuing to

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:11,440
grow as an individual contributor which

00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,950
one would would I be more interested in

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,900
and I told her that I was not

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,089
particularly interested in the

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,510
day-to-day work of being a manager but I

00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:20,950
was

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:23,980
interested in being a leader in

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:25,990
technology I spent all my time outside

00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:27,640
of work being in the community and

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,170
paying attention to what's new and all

00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,330
these things I wanted you to take that

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:32,950
knowledge and apply that and help make

00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,110
decisions that help teach people along

00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:36,250
the way

00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:37,660
so a couple of days later she brought me

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,810
into her office and she said there was

00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,790
an architect position available in the

00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:44,830
organization of 60 or 70 people and she

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,750
would like to give me that role now at

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,340
the time this was not just a promotion

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,670
this was a double promotion it would

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,320
have skipped a level in between and this

00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,300
sounded like exactly what I wanted so at

00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:58,240
the age of 27 I became I don't know this

00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,980
for sure but probably one of if not the

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,650
youngest architects in the entire

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,820
company at FedEx and so I got to do a

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,340
lot of cool stuff I got to be in

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,780
meetings where we made technical

00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,700
decisions and I got to give my

00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:11,890
recommendations and I got to draw really

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,840
cool diagram so this is actually a legit

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:16,180
diagram of teaching someone how a system

00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,770
work we ended up taking trips to Europe

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:19,450
and I got to spend time with my team and

00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:20,860
Europe and my wife came over and got to

00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:22,690
meet me in Europe and we get to have fun

00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,490
and did I mention I got to travel in

00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,580
first-class to do that which is pretty

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,710
sweet so all of that was going pretty

00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,900
well but eventually that architect

00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:33,850
position became more and more about

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,110
meetings and for me these meetings

00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,580
didn't seem relevant they were about

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,100
other projects that I didn't

00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:43,120
specifically work on and I felt like my

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:45,010
time was wasted when I would go to work

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,220
in the morning I was less excited about

00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:50,290
going to work when I would come home in

00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,480
the evening I was much more excited to

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,370
leave work and to go home and during the

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,200
day I was very distracted thinking about

00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,500
the things that I truly enjoyed creating

00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:01,570
videos creating content teaching people

00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,400
and so I started to kind of look around

00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,050
at a lot of the people at FedEx some of

00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,610
the older generation at FedEx and I

00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,130
started to sound like them I was

00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:10,810
complaining about things but they had

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:13,060
also decided this was kind of as good as

00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:15,340
it gets things are the way they are and

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,440
they were just gonna ride out their

00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,640
career at FedEx and retire and have a

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,650
good life and all those kind of things

00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:23,050
but they still weren't happy necessarily

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,030
at their job and I realized that that

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,370
mentality sounded a lot a lot like how

00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:29,200
my dad would have looked at his jobs

00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:29,950
that he had had over the years this is

00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,720
just what it is

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,010
I get paid that's where I'm gonna finish

00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,780
my career

00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:37,960
and I realized that's not the part of my

00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,640
dad that I wanted to be so I ended up

00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,530
realizing I couldn't focus or I couldn't

00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,930
control how many meetings I was in but I

00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:46,330
could control what my job was so I ended

00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:49,930
up leaving FedEx and I started my career

00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:51,400
at Ostia and now I get to do all of this

00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:53,650
amazing stuff every day and it's exactly

00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:56,080
what I wanted to do and then a thing

00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:58,680
that I learned at FedEx was to pay

00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:01,540
attention to your mood if you are

00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,800
unhappy with something in your life or

00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,140
your career it's up to you to make that

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,540
change to take what you can control to

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,920
be vocal to be your own conductor but

00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,220
you have to pay attention to your mood

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,829
to realize when you need that now posted

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,449
something about this on Twitter and

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,670
someone very appropriately commented

00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:20,500
that's really great advice but not

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,870
everyone has the privilege to just leave

00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:25,150
a job or find a job the next day and I

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,699
wanted to I wanted to address this

00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:29,920
because this was this was very true this

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,230
was extremely true and so you can't just

00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,540
leave your job or find a new job

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,370
overnight but what you can do is you can

00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:37,720
take an online course to develop your

00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,300
skills you can watch a couple of YouTube

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,950
videos to develop your skills you can

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,680
reach out to a mentor to ask for advice

00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,270
you can build out your portfolio and you

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,370
can attend community events and you can

00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,990
invest in the community and network

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,350
because you never know which one those

00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,640
people might lead to your next position

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:56,710
so at this point if I could talk to my

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,470
dad I would say don't procrastinate it's

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:01,480
never too late and pay attention to

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,190
where you are and how you feel and how

00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,900
happy you are and think about where you

00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:07,810
want to be and what happiness looks like

00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:10,420
for you and mind that gap find out what

00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:14,650
that gap is and take baby steps to get

00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:17,290
there so my name is James Q Quick and I

00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:20,380
am incredibly happy with where I am in

00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,270
my life and my career but I owe it to

00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,920
myself to reflect on that and check in

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,690
with myself every couple of months just

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,030
to make sure I'm on the right track and

00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:33,360
if not take baby steps to get back on

00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:33,360
track and so do you thank you

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,450
and I think we'll have some time for

00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,549
questions too

00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,660
yeah thank you very much thank you very

00:18:43,549 --> 00:18:48,020
much for your talk

00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,170
James it was really inspiring I will

00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:54,049
have to set up a timer for for each

00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:57,220
month so she will remind me about the

00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:59,480
question are you happy with your job

00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:03,980
yeah that's what that would be really a

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:10,760
great idea you can trade market it it's

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:13,100
yours you you did the call regarding the

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:17,660
QA that there were probably no questions

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:20,419
during the talk I hope I have one

00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,140
question although it was really

00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:27,799
inspiring thank you a lot

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:30,980
mmm well how come the do you have a

00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:33,710
motivation after after you London New

00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:37,880
York which it seemed seemed like a CPU

00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:43,010
you left one of your parents passed away

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:46,309
and you've found the motivation to just

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:49,040
study the online courses on YouTube and

00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:52,429
for me it sounds like okay this is the

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,190
time when I want to just stay at home

00:19:52,429 --> 00:20:00,049
for a month and to literally nothing

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:03,110
just be sad so so how come like this is

00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:06,470
this is some incredible piece of self

00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:09,049
motivation which I see here and it seems

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:11,210
like something which I would not be able

00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:13,370
to overcome maybe or it would be really

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:19,549
hard to just do this

00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:21,140
Souths self-reflection yeah well I think

00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:23,540
so a couple of things that are important

00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:26,030
to remember the the amount of time that

00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,740
it took from my father passing away to

00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:30,020
starting at FedEx was about six months

00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,730
so when you said you wanted to like lay

00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:34,160
around the house and be sad for months

00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,690
like I certainly did that too there was

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:38,299
a lot of time in there but I think like

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,130
I said there was there was just like my

00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:41,390
my wife pushing and kind of questioning

00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,650
me to make sure that like with

00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:45,290
everything going on I'm still keeping

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,270
track of like I need I need to be

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:48,280
working towards a career it gives you a

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,530
distraction I think

00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,820
for me at that point I just started

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:53,290
getting into web development and I

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,450
really just fell in love with it and

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,010
that made it a lot easier to keep going

00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:58,390
but it also was a distraction I felt

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:00,010
like I was working towards something I

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,660
felt like I had control over something

00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:03,310
and that just made it that much easier

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,350
to continue to work with it and then

00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:07,450
obviously it paid off when it came to

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,710
the interview because I had so much that

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,930
I could talk about so much experience

00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,250
from that from like longer than six

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,380
months but especially in those couple of

00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,670
months and then projects and portfolio

00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,380
things that I had built if that made it

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,360
so much easier to go in and really nail

00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,310
that interview so yeah I certainly

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,750
certainly struggled during that time it

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:25,420
was very a tough time or it was

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,590
definitely a very tough time but just

00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,150
finding something that I could latch

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:29,500
onto that I could control that I could

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,450
invest in and feel like I'm making

00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,470
progress was the reason that I was able

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:36,970
to keep doing it and then eventually

00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:40,240
land the job at FedEx absolutely make

00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:43,870
sounds thank you we have in the meantime

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,900
there are some some questions there from

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:51,310
Jessie hope here is the question why are

00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:53,050
you so awesome I I don't know Jessie our

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,580
code stacker if you if you're not

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,660
familiar with Jesse he's code stacker on

00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:57,310
YouTube you should definitely go check

00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:59,710
him out he's got screenshots of his

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:03,730
courses in this slide deck by the way I

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:08,830
will answer is that by Nature

00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:13,390
yes just naturally it just happens damn

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:17,380
there's no chain chance for you Jesse I

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:19,360
will check it out I'm just kidding yeah

00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:22,450
and there is there is one more question

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,760
from Luke ash what can I do

00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:27,190
once I realize I'm an unhappy in a

00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:30,420
current job how to find out position I

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:34,510
can enjoy more how to build an interview

00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:37,810
over-over opportunities that I probably

00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:39,910
don't don't know yet yeah if there are

00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:41,350
several things that come to mind one for

00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,940
me at the time I had never done what

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,880
development and I just happened to kind

00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:47,200
of try out a course on udemy and I ended

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,320
up falling in love with it and that was

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,240
after having taken three or four

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,560
previous ones only mobile development

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,970
and other things and that was just the

00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,110
thing that clicked so I think one thing

00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:57,970
you can definitely do is just kind of

00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,920
expose yourself to more things I don't

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,330
know if if people here are traditionally

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,110
developers in the audience or what

00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:03,549
people do

00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,169
but if you're a developer maybe there's

00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,850
other pieces of development that you can

00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:09,460
experiment with and see if you enjoy if

00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:11,529
you are naturally social person as a

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:13,120
developer there are roles like Technical

00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:15,100
Evangelist which is our developer

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,480
advocates which is what I am now or you

00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,100
get to have this really good mix of

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,960
being social and giving presentations

00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,159
and talks and stuff while also still

00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,529
being very technical and getting your

00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,470
right code I think another way you do

00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:28,720
that is by building your network like it

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,370
sounds odd maybe but Twitter is a huge

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,640
place to invest in the developer

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:35,200
community and follow people who who are

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,700
interesting to you who are doing

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,529
different types of roles and you can

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:40,870
kind of see what they do and how they do

00:23:38,529 --> 00:23:42,370
it and I reach out to lots of people

00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,870
that I don't know to ask them things

00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,889
about their job if you if there's

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:47,049
something you think you might be

00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:48,639
interested in find someone who does that

00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:50,320
and reach out to them and use them as a

00:23:48,639 --> 00:23:52,360
mentor and build out your network

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,919
because you never know which one of

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,330
those random jobs or which one of those

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,860
random companies or which one of those

00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,820
random people will help lead to your

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,789
next job in the future

00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,260
so just for coming overall more aware by

00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:04,149
being in meetups like this by being

00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,500
online on Twitter by having your people

00:24:04,149 --> 00:24:07,960
that you hang out with and you trust

00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:10,149
either in person or online you have that

00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,529
many more people to bounce ideas around

00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,940
with and then kind of find out more

00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:17,139
about their careers and see how that

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,750
might help you out in the future no

00:24:17,139 --> 00:24:24,460
thanks hopefully it was sufficient

00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:26,620
answer for Lucas Danielle is asking

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,169
hello thanks for sharing your

00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:32,049
experiences my question is what would be

00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:35,649
an optimal job for a junior with two to

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:38,110
three years of experience in coding sure

00:24:35,649 --> 00:24:39,850
I mean like cliche answer is it

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,620
obviously depends it depends on what

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,049
your particular interests are for me

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,340
coming out of college with no experience

00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:47,110
for me to work at Microsoft as a

00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,929
Technical Evangelist was was certainly

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:51,580
an optimal job for me but it was not it

00:24:49,929 --> 00:24:53,139
was not very much programming it was

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,299
more about this side the speaking and

00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:56,799
the presentations and stuff so that's

00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,750
very different than the route that most

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,730
people would traditionally take so in

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,350
terms of you specifically if you have

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:03,940
any idea of what is it that you want to

00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,889
do long term then you kind of backtrack

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:08,529
from there if I wanted to eventually be

00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:10,240
a speaker a professional speaker then

00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:12,100
getting into a Technical Evangelist role

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,539
was really helpful for that if I wanted

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:15,010
to if my goal was to be the most

00:25:13,539 --> 00:25:15,460
technical on the best software developer

00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,000
in the world

00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,290
the

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,140
I would want to find a role that does

00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:21,520
software development every day so it I

00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,170
would say just think about the things

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,760
that you're most interested in and what

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:26,620
that might look like in 10 years and

00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,160
then try to backtrack from there and

00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,720
like it same or similar to the answer

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,160
previously talked to people ask people

00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,020
who do these jobs and see how they

00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,120
started and what their first role was or

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,280
their second role and then you can kind

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,690
of gauge how that fits for you and you

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,370
can do your research and find companies

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:43,750
and opportunities and then apply

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,610
hopefully for something that puts you

00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,620
down the baby steps towards your

00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:52,660
longer-term goal of whatever that path

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:55,660
is for you yep a big tracking seems

00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:57,550
really reasonable hope Danielle that the

00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:03,690
answer was sufficient and thank you

00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:06,880
thank you James that's all for the Q&A

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:10,120
so that's it thank you James thank you

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,610

and we move on we will move on to our

00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:40,840
next speaker the deaf talk which will be

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:41,350
done by by Martin split Martin are you

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,290
here

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:48,580
how are you hi everyone how's it going

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:53,920
I'm doing pretty well how are you Andy

00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:56,800
I'm also pretty well liked pretty great

00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,240
evening great first talk that was

00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:03,090
awesome yeah yeah I always loved that

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,160
there's the first talk which will

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:08,230
somehow even when it's evening it will

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,140
inspire you to do something with

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:15,730
yourself and do a little bit more before

00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:17,350
I will go to sleep so really great but

00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:21,220
you have also signed some great topic

00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:22,810
rebirth about the technical SEO this is

00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:26,440
a topic which I'm really actively

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:28,840
solving during your during the day as a

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,770
developer so I'm really looking forward

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,620
to

00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:39,400
this I I hope that I will I will get to

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:41,740
do some deep knowledge and deep dive so

00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:43,360
looking forward thank you very much and

00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,140
the space stage is yours

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:49,120
thank you very much Thanks so it won't

00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:51,070
be that much of the T type because most

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,270
people are not aware of what we are

00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:54,040
talking about when we talk about

00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:56,530
technical SEO so this is a bit of an

00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,360
intro but there is like a top list of

00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,550
things that I keep seeing people do

00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,220
wrong even though that sometimes makes

00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:05,830
me very very sad that people are still

00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:07,090
doing this wrong it's Google policy that

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,400
I can't share my slides so you

00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:11,020
definitely want to pay attention and do

00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,420
feel free to ask questions throughout

00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:18,430
our happy day try to answer them all at

00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:20,290
the end cool so now as I'm reset we will

00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,960
be talking about technical SEO but

00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,420
before we dive into technical SEO let's

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,310
actually figure out what SEO means not

00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:31,180
everyone is familiar with the term it's

00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:33,730
search engine optimization sounds great

00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:35,260
optimizing for search engines simple but

00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:37,600
then if you ask people what that means

00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:40,270
you eat deck you tend to get two answers

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,820
either oh it's very easy to just like

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:45,220
buy some links that's a bad answer by

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,470
the way or our this is all just like

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,720
 also actually a pretty bad

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:51,940
answer but if you ask people who know a

00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,070
little bit more about SEO and you let

00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:57,780
them talk for a while you sometimes feel

00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:01,210
like you are looking at a very scary

00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:04,390
complicated phenomenon like the weather

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:06,340
right the weather is quite interesting

00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:08,170
and fascinating and broad lots of things

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,520
happening in the same time and different

00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,250
things can go wrong and then you have a

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,980
thunderstorm SEO is relatively similar

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:16,930
it's a little bit like developers if you

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,880
ask someone are you a developer and they

00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:21,010
say yes you don't really know what they

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,530
do they might be working in embedded

00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:26,350
systems and builds control software for

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:28,300
cars or rockets or maybe they work in

00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:30,640
game development maybe they do mobile

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,430
apps maybe they do web there's a huge

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:36,280
variety of stuff that can be done in

00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:39,040
software development and such is SEO as

00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:43,290
well there are more technical parts to

00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:45,930
it and less technical parts to it so

00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:47,910
if we think about SEO as a developer I'm

00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:49,770
a developer I'm a web developer that's

00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,240
what I have been doing for quite some

00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,400
time I have to have done other

00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:57,780
development work like actually embedded

00:29:53,400 --> 00:30:00,180
development as well but as a web

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:03,180
developer I thought SEO doesn't really

00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:05,520
touch my job it's not really what I need

00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:07,020
to be aware of or dealing with but then

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,510
again if you think about it as web

00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:11,940
developers what do we do we build

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,160
websites for people to consume people

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,860
being in the care keyword our users

00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,570
right but there is another group that we

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,340
are kind of catering toward we should be

00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:21,990
catering to to some degree which is

00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:25,110
search engine search engines you can

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:27,810
imagine as undocumented or poorly

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,340
documented api's that are interacting

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,310
with our content to understand our

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:34,740
content these search engines usually try

00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:37,260
to emulate the behavior of a user but

00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,940
they don't do that to 100% accuracy so

00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,680
and that's not even what they want to do

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,050
there they have specific reasons to act

00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:46,140
the way they act so if I understand this

00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:48,780
less well documented API which is a

00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:51,300
search engine like Google search or any

00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,940
of your other favorite search engines we

00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,370
need to understand what this does and

00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:59,490
roughly every search engine is made out

00:30:56,370 --> 00:31:00,960
of four parts more or less the first

00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,910
part is the crawler that's the thing

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,520
that requests things from your server

00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:07,500
it's literally making HTTP requests and

00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,240
a few more other things like trying to

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,650
not overwhelm your server and bring your

00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,030
website down in the process of

00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:15,300
requesting things from your website

00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:16,950
server as well as making sure that they

00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,480
are not accessing things you don't want

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:21,090
them to access all this kind of stuff

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,710
happens in the crawler prioritizing what

00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,090
to crawl because it turns out the web is

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,790
quite big it doesn't make sense to just

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,920
crawl everything all the time unless you

00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:30,780
want to build the world's largest cloud

00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,420
that just crawls websites which is

00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,130
ridiculous so that's the first part we

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,560
we fetch things from your server that's

00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:39,600
the crawler then we need to understand

00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:41,700
what is the thing that we've got right

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,130
what is this website about that's the

00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:46,440
question what might someone look for

00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:49,230
where this website would be a good place

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,720
to go if your website is about cats then

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,580
that's only the surface of the right if

00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,940
your website is about cat pictures or

00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,070
kitten pictures or is your website about

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:01,710
Dietary tricks and tips for unhealthy

00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:04,500
cats is it about the Denarius for cats

00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:07,230
is it about I don't know

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:08,790
vacation care for cat who knows there's

00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,750
many many different things around the

00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:11,670
topic of cats

00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:13,680
so someone looking for what's the best

00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:15,540
cat food might not be interested in your

00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:17,700
website if your website just offers cat

00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:20,430
pictures even though I would say that

00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,400
cat pictures are always fantastic so

00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:26,160
that's the indexer but then we have a

00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:30,540
list of things for a topic given and now

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:34,500
we have a query let's say like cheapest

00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:37,020
cafe now there's many websites with

00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,000
cheap cafes that I could go to and work

00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,690
from for instance or good place good

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,250
cafe to work from mmm now we need to

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,810
bring this list of your else that we

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,820
have in a certain order so that we can

00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,500
show you what we think is the best hit

00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,270
for you and what's the second-best

00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,030
website or the third best website for

00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:56,280
this query at the time at the moment

00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,790
that you're asking this and this is

00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,860
tricky it turns out to model what is a

00:32:59,790 --> 00:33:04,050
good website for a given query for a

00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:07,560
given intention that you want like the

00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:09,570
best place to best cafe to work from is

00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:12,360
dependent on many many different factors

00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:15,690
we look at hundreds of ranking factors

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,240
in this case a few of them are known and

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:19,740
public such as if your website has HTTPS

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,690
that is a ranking factor it's not the

00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,770
most important because a website about a

00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:28,980
cafe that you can work in that has HTTPS

00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:31,740
but is in let's say also I'm in Zurich

00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:33,270
it's an Oslo that that cafe doesn't help

00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,380
me right now where I'm in Zurich right

00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,290
it's not helpful

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,750
so maybe the website that has HTTPS the

00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:42,270
cafe website with HTTPS in also is it

00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:44,880
less helpful than the Zurich cafe

00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:47,360
website that does not have HTTPS so it

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:51,030
can't be the one factor obviously but

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,800
PageSpeed HTTPS mobile-friendliness

00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:54,870
security a bunch of other things are

00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,840
things that we look at but also

00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:59,610
obviously how good is the content so

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,560
again we grab back to content

00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:03,060
understanding and then also when people

00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,740
talk about ranking they often

00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,990
misunderstand how ranking works in

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,120
general so as I said if I'm searching

00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,869
for a best cafe to work in right now in

00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,210
Zurich

00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:13,769
I probably get results in Zurich but

00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:16,409
then if I'm in an if different city the

00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:18,450
rankings will look different it also

00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:20,429
differs on which language setting I'm

00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:22,559
looking at a website that offers English

00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:24,409
when I'm searching in English might be

00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:28,499
better than the website that is in

00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:30,659
German or whatever right so rankings are

00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:31,980
very subjective and very very tricky and

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,779
they can move because if you have a

00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,569
fantastic website and you're ranking

00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:38,669
first for what you care about you offer

00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:40,379
vacuum cleaners and you are ranking

00:34:38,669 --> 00:34:41,879
number one for vacuum cleaners if I'm

00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:42,839
searching for best vacuum cleaner you

00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:44,279
show up that's great

00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:46,559
but now someone else makes a better

00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:49,230
website so then you lose that ranking

00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,970
and it's not entirely up to you it is

00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,309
about the fact that the web keeps

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,589
changing so ranking is a bit of a hidden

00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,999
miss and last but not least we do have

00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:58,829
to have our own web servers that are

00:34:56,999 --> 00:35:01,230
actually like taking the ranking ranked

00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:03,269
results and serve them to the users and

00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:04,710
show you the web search results that you

00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:07,410
know when you go through the search

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,089
engine of your choice what I love

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,519
serving basically is entirely our

00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:14,130
problem that's not up for for you to

00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:15,989
deal with but I do think as developers

00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,819
we do have a lot of influence over the

00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:22,130
first two stages and that's crawling and

00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:24,930
indexing for crawling well we chose

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,089
probably hopefully chose the URL

00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,549
structure how our website is reachable

00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,950
and we chose the technical set up

00:35:29,549 --> 00:35:34,109
probably how do we host where do we host

00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:35,910
do we use a CDN do we not use the CDN

00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:37,980
these things can make a difference in

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:40,259
terms of how much we crawl if I'm using

00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:42,930
a Raspberry Pi under my computer and

00:35:40,259 --> 00:35:45,029
Googlebot tries to fetch a thousand

00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,519
pages in one second this Raspberry Pi

00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:49,920
might actually not hold up too well so

00:35:47,519 --> 00:35:52,289
Googlebot will be like okay I'll fetch

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,150
less pages next time which is a problem

00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:56,579
if I have 10 million products and I'm a

00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:59,279
huge online reseller if on the other

00:35:56,579 --> 00:36:01,589
hand I use a proper stable server setup

00:35:59,279 --> 00:36:03,390
and I can fetch a thousand things at the

00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:05,369
same time then Googlebot will be like

00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,380
well maybe I try mm things next time

00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:09,450
which means we are seeing your content

00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:12,269
faster usually or update your content

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:14,759
faster and that's one thing that we have

00:36:12,269 --> 00:36:16,710
under control more or less usually as

00:36:14,759 --> 00:36:19,769
developers we get to choose more or less

00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:21,660
our deployment set up hopefully if you

00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:23,210
can't you should talk to your ops people

00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,560
maybe

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,300
and in the indexer well if we are making

00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,140
technical decisions that lead to

00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:35,150
Googlebot not seeing our content and

00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:37,010
basically flying blind not knowing what

00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,930
our website contains because there may

00:36:37,010 --> 00:36:40,310
be our JavaScript has a bug and actually

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:43,339
all the content that we fetch from the

00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:45,680
graph QL API doesn't even make it into

00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:47,960
the browser for Googlebot then that

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,660
means that we can't see your content so

00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,490
we don't know what this is about and if

00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:54,230
we don't know what this is about what

00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:56,210
this what is your website about we don't

00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,250
know it's an empty page then that means

00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:00,740
we can't really put it in the index and

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:02,119
we can't really rank it for anything

00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:05,180
because we don't know what the website

00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,520
is about hmm not great another thing is

00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:09,950
if we are making decisions that make the

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,410
website very very slow that's something

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,390
that we do pick up in ranking its a

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:16,330
ranking factor website speed so if we

00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:18,950
make our website's very very very slow

00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:22,210
because we are using lots of JavaScript

00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:24,980
or we're using caching inefficiently and

00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:27,470
so on and so forth that might also in

00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:29,570
impact how the index or things of our

00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,260
website so that's something that we have

00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:31,849
control over

00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:35,839
well you shouldn't worry too much about

00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:37,670
is ranking that's just dragons it's all

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:39,800
dragons lots of dragons

00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:41,480
of course it's lots of factors really

00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,000
you don't really have that much

00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,920
influence over ranking focus on making

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,510
sure that your content is there that

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,220
your website is fast that your server

00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:53,089
holds out that you don't have any weird

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,820
problems and then you'll be fine trust

00:37:53,089 --> 00:37:57,440
me this is going to be fine even with

00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,330
the content that something's that

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,040
usually you might want to talk to your

00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:03,530
sales or marketing department about

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,170
maybe you have an SEO on your team who

00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:08,270
can help you with this SEO so usually

00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,410
pretty good first points of contact when

00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:11,240
it comes to making sure that your

00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:13,580
content is good investing and

00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,830
copywriters is also usually a great idea

00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:20,500
and sometimes when I talk to developers

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:23,780
that I remind myself of how I

00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:26,570
experienced my life as a developer with

00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:29,660
SEO on board you either as an agency or

00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:32,359
on the team sometimes as you also ask

00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:35,500
you to do things that are not great for

00:38:32,359 --> 00:38:37,190
the user that's not a good practice

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:42,880
generally speaking

00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:46,099
all of our goals should basically align

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,109
because if you think about it and as a

00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,390
developer build websites so that people

00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,339
are using it maybe in the next Google

00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,810
and Facebook Microsoft whatever all

00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:55,579
right that's what I'm striving for I

00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,130
want to have a fantastic product and I

00:38:55,579 --> 00:38:59,810
want people to use that now where do I

00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,319
get new people from well I can use

00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:05,329
marketing campaigns and ads but who

00:39:02,319 --> 00:39:07,130
loves ads as much I mean if I'm looking

00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:09,200
for something you very likely going

00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:10,880
through a search engine around half of

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,339
the traffic on the web usually comes

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,859
from search engines so if you are seeing

00:39:13,339 --> 00:39:17,420
only 10% of the people who come to your

00:39:15,859 --> 00:39:20,180
website the first time are coming from

00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:22,730
organic search engines it usually means

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,319
that you are leaving free traffic out

00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:26,060
there so like people who could

00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:27,470
potentially be on your website and

00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:29,599
should potentially be on your website

00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:31,700
are not because there's something in the

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:33,230
way either your content is misleading

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,230
and doesn't look like what you're trying

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:38,089
to do or say with it or there's a

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,220
technical problem those are the two main

00:39:38,089 --> 00:39:42,980
factors when the organic search traffic

00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:45,349
doesn't add up so you want to find you

00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:47,690
know you want new users to find your

00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:49,819
content your website your web app your

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:53,240
social network whatever it is you're

00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:56,030
building and Google search we as a

00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:58,040
search engine we want to show good and

00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:00,410
relevant content to users looking for

00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:02,270
that content so if they're I use is

00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:04,849
looking for your social network or your

00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:07,869
e-commerce shop or whatever it is or

00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:10,579
your blog articles on some topic and

00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:13,579
your articles are good and your products

00:40:10,579 --> 00:40:15,380
are great we want these products and

00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:17,930
bulk articles to be visible to the

00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,819
people looking for them so it's kind of

00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:22,550
Alliance right you want new people to

00:40:19,819 --> 00:40:23,810
come to your staff we want good stuff to

00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:27,230
show to people so if you're building

00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:29,810
good stuff we should want to show your

00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:32,390
website to them and NCOs are kinda in

00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:36,920
good SEO anyways are in the middle of

00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:40,099
that they are common excuse me they are

00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,109
making sure that what we do as a search

00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:45,530
engine and what you do as a web

00:40:42,109 --> 00:40:47,900
developer works together aligns so that

00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:50,300
new people who want your content can

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,580
actually find your content and consume

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,710
you

00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:55,650
to search engines and get to your

00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,840
website through search engines so you

00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,790
see like it kind of lines like search

00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:02,520
engines want to do this you want to do

00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:05,610
this and then SEO should help you get

00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,850
these two things to be the same great

00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:12,060
they are also not still great SEO and

00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:14,370
they usually apply shady tactics or

00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,600
things that are not exactly in the users

00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:19,980
interest to try to gain the system that

00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:22,290
oftentimes sounds very easy and like a

00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,610
great bang for the buck it's like oh

00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,240
yeah we pay them a little bit and then

00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:29,910
they do links or whatever usually in the

00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,830
longer term that backfires because if

00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:35,490
you're gaming the system too obviously

00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:37,740
we will might might possibly penalize

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:39,090
you by not showing you on search results

00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,700
or not showing you very high on search

00:41:39,090 --> 00:41:43,560
results it might also be that this

00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:45,630
eventually like hurts you in the longer

00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:48,570
run differently by just like lower

00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:51,030
rankings and stuff just try to think of

00:41:48,570 --> 00:41:53,340
what your users need what users want how

00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:55,530
they how they not you how they think

00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:58,530
about it and how they search for things

00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:01,230
and SEO our experience in that field and

00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:03,180
help you if they are good at what they

00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,710
are doing let's let me give you an

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:06,720
example before we get into technical SEO

00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,580
I want to give you an example to to

00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:12,240
highlight why I have been mentioning

00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:14,880
content multiple times at this point I'm

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,500
a breakfast person I love my breakfast

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,870
and I usually have toast for breakfast

00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,660
however my toaster broke down so I need

00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:24,210
a new toaster if I were to come to this

00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,150
website would this be a good website for

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:28,830
me to find a new toaster I don't know

00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,480
looking at the image maybe this might

00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:32,010
actually be a toaster I'm not a hundred

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:34,440
percent sure but it looks roughly like a

00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:36,510
toaster but then I might read the second

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,110
most prominent thing which says smart

00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:44,130
simple beautiful sounds very fancy but

00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:46,800
means nothing nada zilch nothing gotten

00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,540
new should right because smart simple

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,230
beautiful this could be about a phone

00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,030
this could be about sunglasses this

00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:55,920
could be about pretty much anything

00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:59,060
smart simple beautiful it could be about

00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:02,250
a car it could be about bold who cares

00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:04,380
this is I don't know this this means

00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,089
nothing to me looking for a toaster

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,589
it will disrupt your breakfast bad I

00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:09,029
don't want my breakfast disrupted I

00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:10,500
don't know how much cocaine the

00:43:09,029 --> 00:43:13,829
marketing department took for this one

00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:15,660
but I'm not interested I want a peaceful

00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:18,660
nice breakfast thermochemical

00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,599
food-processing what does that mean

00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:24,119
there's a cook my bread is this a is

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,740
this a rice cooker I don't know best

00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,869
invention since sliced bread that's a

00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:30,750
wing towards toaster but I am still not

00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:33,000
sure if we look further on this website

00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,220
it says hot bread I thought might be a

00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,549
toaster but I don't even know let's see

00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:41,549
what else do we have links home okay I'm

00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:44,579
guessing I am on home our philosophy

00:43:41,549 --> 00:43:47,369
I had Latin in school I read lots of

00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:49,680
philosophers great stuff definitely if

00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:51,900
you were bored read some of them but I

00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,769
want a toaster so not a philosophy not

00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,849
interested hot bread x10 what is the I

00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:59,430
don't even know what the hot bread

00:43:56,849 --> 00:44:02,579
exists yet what's in it how bad x10 is

00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:06,299
that good is that bad is that infectious

00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:08,849
I don't know join the movement ah I am

00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:11,400
NOT interested in changing my religion

00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:14,970
thank you very much goodbye so you see

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,890
the design is clean and fancy and this

00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:18,569
is actually based on some real-world

00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:19,920
websites I've seen that we're wondering

00:44:18,569 --> 00:44:23,369
why they weren't showing up in search

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,529
results um clean

00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:28,640
the website load super fast uses the

00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:31,529
latest version of react angular view

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:33,900
whatever don't care uses the latest

00:44:31,529 --> 00:44:37,460
coolest thing whatever loads in under a

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:42,240
second has HTTP is mobile friendly but

00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,890
the content is not great I don't I as a

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,799
human don't understand that this is

00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:50,000
potentially a website about toasters I

00:44:46,799 --> 00:44:52,950
don't I still don't know that for sure

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,930
so let's just not touch the design or

00:44:52,950 --> 00:45:00,539
the technology just change the content

00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:03,299
and the fastest toaster there we go now

00:45:00,539 --> 00:45:04,980
we're talking this is a toaster I'll be

00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:07,170
the happiest man on earth I'll have a

00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:09,269
toaster this toaster also never burns my

00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:11,880
toast that's amazing

00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:13,859
it gets me my toast faster mmm I love

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,470
that that's fishin and German I like

00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:17,800
efficiency try toasting Mike Joseph a

00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:19,750
score

00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,400
also a software engineering and in that

00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,660
as an engineer so I'm like I need to

00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,700
make sure that I choose the right

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,960
toaster so I need criteria to choose the

00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,030
right host but I don't know what this

00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,650
criteria would be like but conveniently

00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:30,880
they have a link that says how to choose

00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:32,320
a toaster so there's an article

00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,910
explaining how to choose the toast

00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,830
that's that's nice that's helping

00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:37,780
maybe I disagree with their methodology

00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:39,610
but that's fine because I can then use

00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:40,330
what they give me as input and adjust it

00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:43,510
to my needs

00:45:40,330 --> 00:45:45,130
if this hot bread or sorry in this case

00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,320
it's called toasty make toaster face

00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:48,610
isn't the right project a product that's

00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,590
not a problem because they have other

00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:53,650
toasters our toasters takes me to other

00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:55,300
products great so I can learn once I

00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:57,250
haven't established my criteria I can

00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,830
compare the different products along my

00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:02,200
criteria that's great and then the call

00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,630
to action is buy a toaster that's what I

00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,610
am trying to do jackpot I can buy a

00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:10,000
toaster this is fantastic I love this

00:46:06,610 --> 00:46:12,630
website best thing ever and it's the

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,770
same technology it's the same design

00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:16,210
everything is the same including the

00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,430
images including the color scheme the

00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:22,300
design everything is the same except

00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:24,490
that the content is a ton better and I

00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:26,400
would wish if there was one thing that

00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:29,170
people would do after my presentations

00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:30,880
it should be look at their content

00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:33,130
through the eyes of someone trying to

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,620
get what they are trying to offer right

00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:38,080
if you're offering toasters make your

00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,830
website say so if you're offering boat

00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:43,540
rides on a lake in the Caribbean

00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:47,680
fantastic make your freaking website say

00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:49,990
so not like in our history as the oldest

00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:51,970
company on this little island unlike the

00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:53,860
Yaris fantastic but what are you is

00:46:51,970 --> 00:46:55,480
trying to sell me and there's so many

00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,190
products and services that are not

00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,410
telling me what exactly they are saying

00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:01,000
and it's fine to have multiple landing

00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:03,490
pages for different people looking for

00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,650
different things that all is covered for

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,180
their products so you have one product

00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:08,950
but you have like ten landing pages

00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,990
where you tell people from their

00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,930
perspective what is this product doing

00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:15,880
that's fine just make that clear to the

00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:19,020
user because if you're not doing that

00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,970
any technical SEO any technical

00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,100
optimizations any design optimizations

00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:27,820
anything like that any link building

00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:31,030
whatever is going to be unsuccessful at

00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:33,240
best if your content is chocolate ice

00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,760
cream a mode

00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:39,190
so yeah but anyway we're developers

00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:41,140
let's talk about technology I promise

00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,730
you technical SEO so let's talk about

00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:44,790
technical SEO but please don't forget

00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:48,190
the rest is also important

00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:49,720
first things first and I mean I can't

00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,100
believe I have to say this but I have to

00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,660
say this so bear with me

00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:56,380
but next two things that we're going to

00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:58,690
discuss our fundamentals but people do

00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:00,670
get them wrong quite often first things

00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,220
first you should have URLs for each

00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,590
piece of content that you care for if

00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:08,230
it's a page that describes your product

00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:10,240
if there's another page that lets people

00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,310
sign up for your product or shows the

00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,250
different pricing of information each of

00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:17,830
these need a URL that explains that and

00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:20,320
is reachable because Googlebot as well

00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:22,090
as other search engines they operate by

00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,770
you or else they get a URL from

00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,140
somewhere and then they look at that URL

00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:29,850
content that isn't reachable through a

00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:33,550
URL it's probably not visible to us a

00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:35,590
good URL is a host like example.com

00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:38,920
slash some path maybe some file name

00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:40,750
fine it can also have fragments like the

00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:43,720
hash tag subsection but do you know what

00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:45,520
fragments are for I'll give you a tip if

00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,990
you have a very very long Wikipedia

00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:48,520
article for instance it's a very long

00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:50,530
piece of content and you want to address

00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:52,450
specifically this part here and there's

00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:55,300
like a heading history this is the

00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:57,880
Wikipedia page on Jam for example and

00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,860
you want the history of Jam fantastic

00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,420
very exciting probably I actually am

00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:07,920
read that then you can like link to Enda

00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:10,990
wikipedia.org slash wikis that jam hash

00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,060
history which means it takes you to a

00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,250
piece of content that is on the page it

00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:18,430
doesn't change the page content if I

00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:21,750
leave out the sahaj tag history I still

00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:24,940
get the entire content so search engines

00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:26,830
kind of ignore the fragment because it's

00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:28,750
just a piece of content so we might show

00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:30,460
that in search results but we are not

00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:33,820
going to crawl that we're not going to

00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,950
get the content if that content changes

00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:39,460
using the hash right we're going to

00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:42,130
ignore that part now when we invented

00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:44,020
single page applications in I don't know

00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:48,230
like 2000

00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:50,090
11 10 something like that we needed a

00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:54,080
way to run JavaScript when something on

00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:57,380
the page was clicked but not open the

00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:59,990
URL changed but not triggering reload

00:49:57,380 --> 00:50:03,290
because we wanted to avoid reloads so we

00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:04,370
used hashes we just use them incorrectly

00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,440
we use the hack

00:50:04,370 --> 00:50:08,480
so whenever the hash changes we get a

00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,090
JavaScript event and then we like lo run

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,950
and Ajax calls and basically we fetched

00:50:11,090 --> 00:50:15,650
on Sony API and then we show the updated

00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:18,470
content fantastic great lovely however

00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:19,700
the downside of that is that we we are

00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:21,440
using fragments for something they

00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:23,000
weren't meant for we are loading

00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,780
different content when the fragment

00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,090
changes which we shouldn't we felt that

00:50:26,780 --> 00:50:31,760
about this so we came up with the hash

00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:33,860
exclamation mark thing which kind of

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,760
says like it's kind of a hash fragment

00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:38,000
but it's not really a hash fragment

00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:42,320
sorry

00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:44,330
maybe so that's that's something that is

00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:46,160
a little tricky to deal with and you

00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:47,690
should not do this so how can you build

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,640
single page applications then if you

00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:51,620
can't just use fragments well there is

00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,810
the history API that has pretty great

00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,910
browser support and if you are on the

00:50:53,810 --> 00:50:57,620
browser that doesn't support it you

00:50:55,910 --> 00:50:59,150
should just do a full reload because

00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,920
then these browsers are definitely not

00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,200
great for JavaScript applications to

00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,910
begin with you get clean URLs and you

00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,100
get a control over the browser history

00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,500
without dealing with full page refreshes

00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,210
so I highly recommend using history API

00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:14,810
if you want to build a single page

00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:16,700
application when we checked and you're

00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:17,990
like yeah this is kinda obvious why as

00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,300
much and talking about this wedding

00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:22,760
where you ran a big crawl last year for

00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:25,220
the web Almanac we found that 12 percent

00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:27,980
of the landing pages of single page apps

00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:30,620
that we called actually to use fragment

00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:32,600
URLs though angular and view have

00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:34,460
changed the default mode in the browser

00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:38,360
so if you are starting a new angular

00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:41,810
project or a new react project you get

00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:44,270
history mode API so history API mode

00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:46,070
routing by default for beauty is when

00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:51,440
the view router you still have to change

00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:54,100
it I think from from hash to to I think

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,060
what they call html5 mode or something

00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:59,370
so twelve percent is

00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:02,640
12% too much that's not making me very

00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:04,410
happy and this is the next thing that I

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:05,760
can't believe we have to talk about but

00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:08,850
we should definitely talk about this

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:11,520
links matter liens have been the killer

00:52:08,850 --> 00:52:13,950
feature when the web came into existence

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,510
at the beginning the whole point of

00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:17,490
being able to click on something and go

00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:21,240
into some some other document on the web

00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:23,700
fantastic stuff this is how you do links

00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:25,320
you do an a tag and a transfer to URL

00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:27,480
this can be a relative URL that's fine

00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:29,970
Googlebot is smart enough to prefix it

00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:35,090
with your host that's not a problem you

00:52:29,970 --> 00:52:37,920
can also totally absolutely have a

00:52:35,090 --> 00:52:39,600
totally absolutely have have an on click

00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:42,000
Handler on that that's that's not a

00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:43,590
problem that's absolutely fine but don't

00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,180
throw away the rest of the link you

00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,950
still need to have an a tag you still

00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:50,010
need to have an HS attribute with URL

00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:52,350
that's the basics this way we can go

00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:54,750
through the HTML find these URLs in this

00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:57,210
case slash stuff and then crawl that in

00:52:54,750 --> 00:53:00,120
the next iteration so if you want us to

00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:01,470
see your pages on your application on

00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,390
your single page app on your website

00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:07,830
doesn't matter you have to have a link

00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:10,470
to them this is technically a link but

00:53:07,830 --> 00:53:12,240
not helpful for search engines

00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:14,220
we don't click on things Googlebot

00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,680
doesn't click on things so this link

00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:20,580
goes nowhere so it is ignored by search

00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:25,460
engine crawlers again this link goes

00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:28,440
through the current page not working

00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:31,260
this one doesn't go anywhere it calls

00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,000
JavaScript function you can't really put

00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,490
that in your address bar in a new tab

00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,560
and then go over there so we can't crawl

00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:39,630
this so again this is not a working I

00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:45,540
mean all most points for creativity but

00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:46,980
no that's on a link the rule of thumb is

00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:48,960
if it does something on the current page

00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:50,640
which Googlebot doesn't really care

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,290
about if it does something on the

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,000
current page that's a button if it takes

00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:57,090
you to another piece of content that

00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,620
should probably be a link that's the

00:53:57,090 --> 00:54:00,240
worst you can do that's not an

00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:02,640
interactive element you are having an

00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:04,320
onclick handler here but screen readers

00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,660
probably don't work yeah but I can throw

00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:08,010
Aria things on it yes you can or you can

00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,780
just use a freaking link there's the

00:54:08,010 --> 00:54:10,920
reason there is the link element just

00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,750
use the earing element

00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,970
you stands or dips for interactive

00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:16,799
elements such as links in this case and

00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:20,549
also this again does not have a URL to

00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:23,910
go to so no please don't do that please

00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:25,920
ignore all this stuff don't do it if you

00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:28,230
have been doing it feel a little bad

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,599
about it and maybe consider changing it

00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:32,819
to links with href attribute so that

00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:35,819
Google crawler as well as other crawlers

00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:40,290
can actually crawl it and screen readers

00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:42,089
do work with them as well sweet so that

00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:45,510
we have now that we have that out of the

00:54:42,089 --> 00:54:47,790
way that's fantastic if you are building

00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:50,160
client side applications clients have

00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:53,130
rendered single page applications or web

00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:55,589
applications in general you might find

00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:57,569
yourself noticing that sometimes I see

00:54:55,589 --> 00:54:59,400
us come to you and say like ah you can't

00:54:57,569 --> 00:55:01,920
see the content if I view soar as it

00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:04,559
looks like this is that isn't that a

00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,930
problem for SEO if they don't know the

00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,540
answer by now you can tell them it is

00:55:06,930 --> 00:55:12,990
not a problem because what happens in

00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:14,369
Googlebot at least I can't really speak

00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:16,619
for other search engines but at least

00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:18,059
for Googlebot I can tell you we do have

00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:21,240
an extra step which is rendering

00:55:18,059 --> 00:55:24,119
rendering is pretty fast works with a

00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,859
headless Chrome and what we do is

00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,540
basically reload your website in a

00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:29,280
headless Chrome and then we run all the

00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,569
JavaScript and then the JavaScript

00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:32,069
generates all the content and then we

00:55:30,569 --> 00:55:33,690
see there all the content hopefully

00:55:32,069 --> 00:55:35,069
unless you're doing something wrong we

00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:38,520
should be seeing all your content so

00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:40,470
this isn't per se a problem render time

00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:43,589
sometimes SEO scales very nervous about

00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:46,680
that and it can take weeks no no that

00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:48,750
has been like I don't even know how to

00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:52,650
more basically because we look at the

00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:54,900
data we actually have the data it takes

00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:57,390
five seconds at median and 90th

00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:59,099
percentile is within minutes so it

00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:00,950
doesn't take that long to wait for us to

00:55:59,099 --> 00:56:03,390
have rendering resources available

00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:06,569
sometimes people get nervous about oh my

00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:08,430
god Googlebot uses chrome 41 no that's

00:56:06,569 --> 00:56:13,109
also not true anymore since May last

00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:15,960
year May 2019 we are using an evergreen

00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:18,420
Googlebot so Googlebot uses a Chrome

00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,849
browser that is more or less up today

00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,760
with the current stable version which at

00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:24,470
the time of this meetup here is Chrome

00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,690
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:29,210
whenever a new version comes out within

00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:30,980
a few weeks usually we update it might

00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:33,830
take a little longer but give or take

00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:37,160
one or two versions we are within Maine

00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:39,260
stable the testing tools are also using

00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:42,520
the current version of Googlebot so you

00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:44,900
will get consistent results everywhere

00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,460
which also means Googlebot suppose web

00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,020
components sometimes people ask me about

00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:50,960
web components we do support web

00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:53,210
components it's fine but web components

00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,430
are not always the same so not all web

00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,690
components are equal in this case here

00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:58,400
we have a web component that put

00:56:56,690 --> 00:57:01,430
something in its shadow Dom saying hello

00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,560
shadow DOM and then the person using

00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:07,060
this web component says hello light Dom

00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:11,750
in site the component what do we see

00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:14,119
well what happens is that if you think

00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:17,060
about it the shadow Dom overrides the

00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:18,800
light Dom so in this shadow Dom there's

00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:21,050
only hello shadow Dom there's no place

00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,970
for the light Dom to go there's no place

00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,560
for the text that the person who uses

00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:27,920
the component has put inside the

00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:29,630
component where that could be living so

00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,369
we wouldn't actually not really see this

00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:34,970
we would only see what's in the shadow

00:57:31,369 --> 00:57:36,980
Dom in this case mmm that isn't exactly

00:57:34,970 --> 00:57:39,410
great because if a search engine that

00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,390
does not support JavaScript comes along

00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,619
it might see had a light on but then a

00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:44,869
search engine that does support

00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:47,119
JavaScript might see how shadow Dom that

00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:50,270
can create problems the best way to

00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:51,980
design web components in that case is to

00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:54,170
give it a way to take the light DOM and

00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,690
protect it into the shadow Dom or move

00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,339
it into the shadow Dom one way of doing

00:57:56,690 --> 00:58:00,130
that is the slot element here we see

00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:02,960
that shadow DOM and then it says slot

00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:04,520
slot basically takes whatever fits the

00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,380
selector here there is no selective so

00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:08,900
everything from the light Dom was taken

00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:11,240
and projected into the shadow Dom so

00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:12,890
even if we render shadow Dom we still

00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:15,589
get the content from the light on and

00:58:12,890 --> 00:58:17,390
the person who wrote the web component

00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:21,140
gets control over where that light DOM

00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:22,820
goes so when we have this component that

00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,190
says I'm shadow Dom and then has a slot

00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:28,580
and then the component is used with I'm

00:58:25,190 --> 00:58:32,060
light Dom as light Dom text inside then

00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:33,589
we are seeing shadow Dom light Dom so

00:58:32,060 --> 00:58:35,540
that's well actually which we are seeing

00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:37,090
I am in shadow Dom I have a typo on the

00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:39,820
slide so

00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:42,370
like Don as well but you see like we see

00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:44,050
both of these things in our component in

00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:45,670
the rendered HTML and that's what we

00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:49,180
would use for indexing so that's not a

00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:51,940
problem also a low-hanging fruit that

00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:55,030
most people are not using yet is using

00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:58,090
native lazy loading lazy loading makes

00:58:55,030 --> 00:59:00,130
things faster Google supports it and in

00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:02,170
this case actually every search engine

00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:04,990
supports it because it's just an HTML

00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:07,000
image or just an iframe iframe is

00:59:04,990 --> 00:59:09,120
non-standard behavior but images are

00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,980
being standardized as a web standard now

00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,900
and the loading lazy means that it only

00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:15,670
loads the image once it becomes visible

00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,790
in the viewport so it sort of serves

00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:21,040
saves for sorry saves the users

00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:23,170
bandwidth and it saves the loading time

00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:26,020
and that makes things faster generally

00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:29,020
it unlocks the method quicker it doesn't

00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,460
download things unnecessarily and it

00:59:29,020 --> 00:59:33,100
works pretty much in every browser

00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:35,500
because it's backwards compatible and it

00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:38,470
is great for search engines as well

00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:39,850
because they are supporting it or if

00:59:38,470 --> 00:59:42,760
they don't support it they still get the

00:59:39,850 --> 00:59:44,320
image that's not a problem you can also

00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:46,150
build it for other elements like if you

00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:48,310
want to load specific content only

00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:49,870
lazily that's absolutely possible just

00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:52,630
don't do it just on scroll we don't

00:59:49,870 --> 00:59:54,280
really Scroll in Google but at least you

00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:55,420
probably want to use an intersection

00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:57,250
observer that gives you a more

00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:59,230
performant more standardized way of

00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:03,120
loading content as it is about to become

00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:06,100
visible much much better solution than

01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:07,750
any like weird thing there's a bunch of

01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:09,790
libraries that do this really well a

01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:11,560
bunch of them using intersections of

01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:12,790
service when available and following

01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:14,410
back to our techniques it's not

01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:16,120
available but there's a bunch of

01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:19,030
libraries that do this well the do test

01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:22,030
and also for Googlebot and other search

01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:25,840
engines another thing that we see quite

01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:27,460
a lot is what we call soft errors so now

01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:30,940
you search for something and in the

01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:32,970
search results you see see this an error

01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:35,500
occurred in the search results and

01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:38,200
that's not great this is my website why

01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:40,450
is this showing up for my website what

01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,640
likely happened is if I go to a website

01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:44,650
or to a page on a website that doesn't

01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:47,860
exist like Lowood know on this cat

01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:49,030
website I as a user I do see an error

01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:50,740
message everything is fine as a

01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:53,220
developer I'm like yeah

01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:55,960
it's done arrow message is shown

01:00:53,220 --> 01:00:58,270
fantastic but if this is a client site

01:00:55,960 --> 01:01:00,430
rendered web application there is a good

01:00:58,270 --> 01:01:02,740
chance that the server actually says

01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:04,990
otherwise the service is 200 okay which

01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:07,000
means it's cool

01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:11,619
does page exist there's content go for

01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:13,390
it normally normally Googlebot is quite

01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:16,330
good at fetching or catching these

01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:17,860
arrows and seeing like hold on this this

01:01:16,330 --> 01:01:19,600
page doesn't have that much content and

01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:22,390
the content looks like an error message

01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:24,130
so we might consider actually not

01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:25,480
putting this in the index and that would

01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:28,900
mean they wouldn't show up in the search

01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:31,210
results but sometimes things go through

01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:32,590
and if you make a computer guess you

01:01:31,210 --> 01:01:35,080
know what happens when you make

01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:37,119
computers guess right as a developer

01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,400
when I say like I you know what I meant

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,450
the computer doesn't care it does what

01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:44,200
it thinks is right

01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:46,000
so don't make Googlebot guess give us a

01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,070
404 but how do you do this in a

01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,140
client-side rendered single page

01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:52,450
application if this is my code I have a

01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:54,610
component in a router maybe the router

01:01:52,450 --> 01:01:57,130
has an arrow state and then shows a page

01:01:54,610 --> 01:02:01,170
let's say OOP see there's nothing here

01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:04,060
or if in this case I make an API call to

01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:05,830
API doc in the lab such cats and then

01:02:04,060 --> 01:02:09,940
the ID from the URL in this case would

01:02:05,830 --> 01:02:11,980
know all would know and then I get the

01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:15,250
JSON and then I check if the field

01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:17,830
exists is set to true it is not and then

01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:21,040
I show an error message but the server

01:02:17,830 --> 01:02:23,290
has served this piece of content already

01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:25,570
with a 200 okay because it doesn't know

01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:27,220
which pages exists only the JavaScript

01:02:25,570 --> 01:02:29,609
figured this one out by making that API

01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:33,730
call so we're kind of screwed aren't we

01:02:29,609 --> 01:02:36,340
actually no we're not we should set up

01:02:33,730 --> 01:02:38,940
our server we should have one specific

01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:41,680
URL like in this case no kitty if

01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,600
anything goes to no kitty it gets a 404

01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,310
that's what is the only URL that is

01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:47,920
configured on the server to be different

01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:51,820
from 200 okay this is definitely always

01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:54,010
giving us a 404 in which case we can

01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:54,550
just redirect even using JavaScript

01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:56,290
that's fine

01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:58,359
so what would happen is Googlebot sees

01:02:56,290 --> 01:03:01,180
this URL somewhere for some reason maybe

01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:03,760
the cat existed once and then goes there

01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:04,490
crawls it gets a 200 ok it gets a bunch

01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,530
of stuff back

01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:09,140
vendor said the jams could run figures

01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:12,260
out this cat doesn't exist redirects us

01:03:09,140 --> 01:03:14,780
to this other URL so we crawl that URL

01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:17,540
instead and then see a 404 so we liked

01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:19,040
so this page here the no kitty actually

01:03:17,540 --> 01:03:20,810
just redirects here so we don't really

01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,940
need this page so we can just like throw

01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:24,980
it out and then the page where we land

01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,990
from the redirect that gives us this

01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:28,700
form force that's not something that we

01:03:26,990 --> 01:03:31,850
would put in the index villa and then

01:03:28,700 --> 01:03:33,590
you're done that's it push this will not

01:03:31,850 --> 01:03:35,570
end up in the index there's an

01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:37,760
alternative using robots meta tags but

01:03:35,570 --> 01:03:39,710
be careful with those they are pretty

01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:42,820
heavy foot guns you want to make sure

01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:45,080
that you're not doing something scary I

01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:48,200
don't have infinite time unfortunately

01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:50,480
but we have a fantastic guide on this

01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:54,350
they wrote and I keep maintaining its

01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:56,570
under Gucci Ellie's - Jas - SEO - basics

01:03:54,350 --> 01:03:58,280
if you want to see this in video form

01:03:56,570 --> 01:04:00,890
that's also perfectly possible we have a

01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,840
JavaScript SEO video series the first

01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:05,150
season has 8 episodes and is already out

01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:07,280
the second season will be filmed later

01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:09,680
probably next year unfortunately due to

01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:13,490
circumstances of all of this while we

01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,260
are doing this virtually now so yeah

01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:17,060
definitely check out the the guide

01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:18,440
definitely check out the videos for more

01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:21,800
information and also on different

01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:24,380
frameworks what you should be doing yeah

01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:27,080
and now last but not least before I

01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:29,990
answer the questions that you have test

01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:31,910
your pages you probably are running

01:04:29,990 --> 01:04:33,619
hopefully running some sort of unit

01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:35,510
tests you probably do some manual

01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:37,280
testing you might use something like

01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:40,790
Cypress or selenium to test your

01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:42,560
puppeteer to test your pages as well all

01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:44,840
of this is great you probably use

01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:46,430
lighthouse I guess everyone here has at

01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,740
least like once looked into lighthouse

01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:51,440
probably or you might use like

01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:54,170
webpagetest or PageSpeed insights one of

01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:56,000
these many fantastic tools there are a

01:04:54,170 --> 01:04:59,359
few will fantastic debugging and testing

01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,910
tools for Google search as well here for

01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:03,380
instance you see in JavaScript error

01:05:01,910 --> 01:05:05,750
message that happens when Googlebot

01:05:03,380 --> 01:05:07,670
visits website in this case the

01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:09,410
serviceworker registration doesn't work

01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,600
because Googlebot disables service

01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:13,340
workers it doesn't completely ignore

01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:14,930
them it basically has support for

01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:16,760
service workers but then when you try to

01:05:14,930 --> 01:05:18,350
register one it with jackets that

01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,600
promise

01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:21,980
the reason is that people coming to the

01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,510
website the first time through Google

01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:26,960
search will not have the serviceworker

01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:29,150
install solution neither should we

01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:31,850
if you want to find out things like that

01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:33,590
you can use tools such as n grok or

01:05:31,850 --> 01:05:35,900
local tunnel to get your local

01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:38,960
development environment available online

01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:41,480
for a temporary time and then plug that

01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:43,700
URL into our testing tools such as the

01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,170
mobile-friendly test mobile-friendly

01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:46,040
test does one very obvious thing it

01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:47,900
tells you if your website is

01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,480
mobile-friendly great but it does much

01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,460
more it shows you which resources have

01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:54,290
been fetched which resources have been

01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:56,660
downloaded which ones have failed and

01:05:54,290 --> 01:05:58,190
why have they ever did you set up robots

01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:01,190
Cheeks you so that we can't get your

01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:02,810
content you would find that out here you

01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:04,910
can see a screenshot over there above

01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:06,470
the folds what we see on the page that

01:06:04,910 --> 01:06:09,410
is actually not as interesting as the

01:06:06,470 --> 01:06:12,680
rendered HTML you see the HTML that we

01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:14,330
will use to index so you know exactly if

01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,250
it shows up in the rendered HTML you

01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:17,720
should be fine if it doesn't show up in

01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:20,810
the rendered HTML that's something that

01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:22,910
you want to investigate that's one

01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,430
texting tool the other fantastic testing

01:06:22,910 --> 01:06:27,470
tool is the search console this one is

01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:30,230
different from the previous one because

01:06:27,470 --> 01:06:32,060
it a looks at your entire website so all

01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:33,830
the pages on your website and also you

01:06:32,060 --> 01:06:35,570
would have to verify that you own the

01:06:33,830 --> 01:06:37,160
domain that you're testing so this can't

01:06:35,570 --> 01:06:39,080
really be done with temporary domains

01:06:37,160 --> 01:06:41,960
but you can debug it monitor things that

01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:43,220
are in production life online on the

01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,170
Internet

01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:48,800
it gives you things like usability

01:06:45,170 --> 01:06:50,690
issues security issues any errors that

01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:53,660
occurred if you see your structured data

01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:55,790
how your website performs how fast it is

01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:57,650
according to the core web vitals so it's

01:06:55,790 --> 01:06:59,030
like a bunch of really cool metrics and

01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:00,650
reports and it also emails you

01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:01,820
proactively if we see a problem that

01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:05,270
wasn't there before

01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:06,440
and if all of these tools are free now

01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,970
there's a third one that I haven't

01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,950
talked about much because I haven't

01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:11,690
talked about structured data much but if

01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:13,280
you're using structured data definitely

01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:15,080
check out the rich results test as well

01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,850
that gives you pretty much the same

01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,300
information as the moment friendly test

01:07:16,850 --> 01:07:21,830
plus - the mobile usability that's what

01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,670
it doesn't do but it gives you

01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:27,380
information over structured data as well

01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:29,330
sweet so these are three fantastic free

01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:30,650
tools that everyone should be using

01:07:29,330 --> 01:07:31,500
every now and then I'm not saying you

01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:33,060
should use them

01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:34,560
day but every now and then to just check

01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:37,040
how your website is doing Google search

01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:39,630
is definitely helping you and with that

01:07:37,040 --> 01:07:40,920
I'd like to say thank you so much for

01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:42,720
listening thank you so much for being

01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:44,610
here I know that SEO is not a topic that

01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,960
everyone is like inherently interested

01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:51,890
in but I would happily take the

01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:51,890
questions now thanks a lot

01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:59,580
thank you very much Martin we have a few

01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:03,210
questions here for sure who are very

01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:06,240
specific one is more general so I will I

01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:10,010
will start with a more general one and

01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:13,950
that is that does the presence of JSON

01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:17,700
linked data or LD provide improve

01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:19,529
ranking it does not but it does make

01:08:17,700 --> 01:08:21,589
your website eligible for what we call

01:08:19,529 --> 01:08:24,180
rich results so these are results

01:08:21,589 --> 01:08:26,490
highlighted a little more like with an

01:08:24,180 --> 01:08:28,620
image or if it's a recipe then we show

01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:30,299
the the preparation time and stuff like

01:08:28,620 --> 01:08:33,210
that it might also bring your website

01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:36,390
into things that a Google assistant so

01:08:33,210 --> 01:08:38,430
it does help you be more engaging in the

01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:43,380
search results but it does not mean any

01:08:38,430 --> 01:08:46,319
ranking advantage thank you

01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:48,960
the next question is more specific and

01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,540
it is connected to the URL structure

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:53,640
which should be used or which is better

01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:55,650
I don't know whether you can see it but

01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,620
I can really that I would like and I can

01:08:55,650 --> 01:09:01,620
see I can see the cursor so whether it's

01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:05,220
a flash product slash some product ID

01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:10,049
slash toaster or some variation of this

01:09:05,220 --> 01:09:13,100
with dashes or with some permutation of

01:09:10,049 --> 01:09:15,600
those words between the slashes does it

01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:19,140
doesn't have any relevance in this

01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:21,060
context at all it doesn't really have

01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:23,279
that much relevance because everyone

01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:24,720
does it slightly differently and as a

01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:28,529
ranking factor it would be pretty

01:09:24,720 --> 01:09:31,049
useless I personally think whatever

01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:35,100
makes most sense for your specific aid

01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:36,990
case if you are selling like lots of

01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:41,660
different kinds of products like

01:09:36,990 --> 01:09:44,940
toasters and I don't know microwaves and

01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:45,240
ovens whatever then I would probably say

01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:47,940
it

01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:49,800
make sense to have / / / category and

01:09:47,940 --> 01:09:51,810
then you can have a category page that

01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,460
tells the user what kind of products you

01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:57,900
are even offering right because if I'm

01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:59,760
if I if I go to like / for that / one

01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:01,500
two five five and then it's like an

01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,060
oyster and then I change the ID and then

01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,510
I end up with a micrograph and I like

01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,000
that

01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:08,100
so don't worry too much about these

01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,380
things they matter not as much as people

01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,180
think it's more important what how do

01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:13,650
you structure your website for me use

01:10:12,180 --> 01:10:15,330
this point of view how does the journey

01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:18,180
look like how do you link from one page

01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:21,990
to the other that's more important than

01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:23,940
the specific the specific URL structure

01:10:21,990 --> 01:10:25,800
I think it makes sense especially if

01:10:23,940 --> 01:10:28,410
there if you have multiple categories to

01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,410
use like products category and then

01:10:28,410 --> 01:10:34,410
product ID or product name and but

01:10:31,410 --> 01:10:38,670
that's up to you in the end yeah

01:10:34,410 --> 01:10:41,730
absolutely makes sense thank you and the

01:10:38,670 --> 01:10:45,210
last one the last one here is that

01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:47,340
Google doesn't show a side links of my

01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:50,490
page in results is there something I can

01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:53,820
do maybe for a little bit of context

01:10:50,490 --> 01:10:55,590
where these side links subside links is

01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:57,510
if you remember what I show you when I

01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:59,670
said like oh this is an arrow so you

01:10:57,510 --> 01:11:01,890
have like a website and then you have

01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:06,900
the most common links below it like I

01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:08,160
don't know if you go to some web shop

01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,690
and you probably have the different

01:11:08,160 --> 01:11:12,930
product categories as what's inside

01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:15,960
links sightings are as far as I'm aware

01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:19,080
a organic feature so we try to figure it

01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:21,990
out from your website from your website

01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,880
like structure which means that if we

01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,740
have a hard time understanding how your

01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:27,780
website is structured by for instance

01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:29,490
not having a good navigation that links

01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:33,450
from one place to another and that gives

01:11:29,490 --> 01:11:34,890
us an ID of idea of how how the website

01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:37,170
structure looks like then we can't

01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:39,030
really generate settings if your

01:11:37,170 --> 01:11:40,260
structure makes sense to us we are

01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:42,960
generally pretty good at figuring

01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:44,640
outside things eventually but as I said

01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:48,900
it's an organic feature we might choose

01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:51,780
not to create site links mm-hmm great I

01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:55,200
have a few questions on my own a feature

01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:58,470
you allow first is regarding the a MP a

01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,960
MP is a technology it was created by

01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:02,970
Google

01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:05,310
so how does the the adoption of this

01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:09,630
technology by developers on their

01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:15,630
websites affects the the ranking or the

01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:17,400
SEO so amp itself does not is not a

01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:20,100
ranking factor it's not a ranking factor

01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:21,780
and you can see that for specific

01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:23,520
queries that you run I actually

01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:26,880
oftentimes get if I'm looking for

01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:28,890
specific articles I get the the actual

01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,960
article before the end version because

01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:32,970
it's faster that can happen and it's

01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:36,570
just one way of getting a fast website

01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:37,890
if you do things right in amp and it

01:12:36,570 --> 01:12:40,860
gives you like this little batch it

01:12:37,890 --> 01:12:44,280
gives this little the ball things like a

01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:46,590
lightning old yeah that's why people so

01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:48,060
so this is this is the only thing we we

01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:51,390
were experimenting back then we were

01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:53,880
like okay so how can we how can we give

01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:55,440
people who are caring about the speed of

01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,170
things a little bit of more visibility

01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:00,030
in the sense that was an experiment that

01:12:58,170 --> 01:13:02,850
the Badgers are still there that's what

01:13:00,030 --> 01:13:04,500
it is for a bunch of technical reasons

01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:08,070
the top stories if you are a new

01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:10,200
stablish er are currently an amp only

01:13:08,070 --> 01:13:11,970
feature as far as I'm aware but we are

01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:13,290
dropping this requirement because we

01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,930
have found better ways to measure

01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:18,900
performance for new sites so once the

01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:21,630
page experience update rolls out in 2021

01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:28,880
top stories won't be and only content

01:13:21,630 --> 01:13:31,710
anymore mm-hmm thank you and towards the

01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:36,420
like what was the penalty for not having

01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:38,880
a public HTML like the the HTML it is

01:13:36,420 --> 01:13:41,880
pretty common that most of the HTML have

01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:44,910
errors because these are big the HTML is

01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:48,590
auto-generated by a framework or

01:13:44,910 --> 01:13:51,540
whatever is there some penalty or

01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:53,250
absolutely no penalty there's no penalty

01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:54,450
and it's not a ranking factor if your

01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:57,960
HTML is valid or not

01:13:54,450 --> 01:13:59,610
however that being said if your HTML is

01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:01,350
mostly correct or even completely

01:13:59,610 --> 01:14:03,360
correct there is a higher chance that we

01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:05,970
understand the semantics of your content

01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:08,460
if all we get is a bunch of dips then

01:14:05,970 --> 01:14:10,140
we're like I don't know what piece of

01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:11,940
this content is more important than the

01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:12,350
other or what what's the structure on

01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:14,540
this

01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:16,790
we will index that and we will probably

01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:18,710
also rank that but if you are

01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:21,170
structuring your content for you use

01:14:18,710 --> 01:14:24,170
this using headlines or bolding or

01:14:21,170 --> 01:14:26,840
whatever this helps us as Googlebot or

01:14:24,170 --> 01:14:28,790
as Google isn't it helps Googlebot

01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,770
understand the semantics of your page

01:14:28,790 --> 01:14:32,630
and the semantics are kind of important

01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:35,930
to understand what your page is about so

01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:38,840
there is no penalty per se it's just the

01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:41,690
more you make us guess the more likely

01:14:38,840 --> 01:14:43,700
we are to get wrong or the more likely

01:14:41,690 --> 01:14:45,740
we are to miss out on something that you

01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:48,440
think is really cool and important about

01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:52,090
the content so the more semantic

01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:52,090
information you give us the better it is

01:14:52,210 --> 01:14:58,630
and maybe last question for me is that

01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:03,790
it is regarding the the performance and

01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:06,980
the optimizing your web page

01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:09,620
specifically for the Googlebot like for

01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:12,140
example skipping part of the content

01:15:09,620 --> 01:15:14,630
which is really hard to render on the

01:15:12,140 --> 01:15:17,570
server for example and it may not be the

01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:21,470
relevant it's maybe something fancy for

01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:24,620
marketing purposes but it wouldn't make

01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:26,600
much sense to index it or crawl it and I

01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:31,030
will serve this content to a Googlebot

01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,030
but I will not do a user for example

01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:37,430
what what's the overall like you your

01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:39,950
mindset about this is this something

01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:44,150
which is it's probably not encouraged

01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:45,860
much but it may be like a logical

01:15:44,150 --> 01:15:49,790
conclusion when you you have a

01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:52,670
performance problem it depends is the

01:15:49,790 --> 01:15:55,400
answer I've heard these questions in

01:15:52,670 --> 01:15:58,550
various variations many times so first

01:15:55,400 --> 01:16:00,350
things first generally speaking as long

01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:02,960
as you're just leaving out content that

01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:05,330
you think is less relevant and do not

01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,800
mislead the users and like say to Google

01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:07,850
about this we're sort of all kittens and

01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,670
then in reality is about

01:16:07,850 --> 01:16:13,190
I don't know selling online medication

01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:14,360
or something like that if you do that if

01:16:13,190 --> 01:16:16,520
you mislead the user that's called

01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,730
cloaking we catch that that gets a

01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:23,110
penalty usually I do not recommend doing

01:16:19,730 --> 01:16:25,640
that that's against our guidelines and

01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:26,250
if you leave our comment that is less

01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,560
relevant

01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:30,480
content that is less relevant and don't

01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,750
serve it to Googlebot or only serve it

01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:36,510
to Googlebot then I don't think we're

01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:38,670
gonna pay as much attention to it and

01:16:36,510 --> 01:16:40,380
it's mostly going to be fine

01:16:38,670 --> 01:16:42,000
it won't exactly help you with

01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:45,120
performance problems as much either

01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:47,850
because we are looking at field data as

01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:49,800
well for the page speed signals or your

01:16:47,850 --> 01:16:50,910
rankings if you're like oh page speed is

01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:53,130
a ranking factor so we're just gonna

01:16:50,910 --> 01:16:55,230
like only serve a little bit of the main

01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:57,090
content to Googlebot so we're fast and

01:16:55,230 --> 01:16:59,400
then for users it's slow we're gonna see

01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:01,440
that and feel data and then field data

01:16:59,400 --> 01:17:03,300
means that we are seeing that real

01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:07,070
people are experiencing the website from

01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:10,380
you and that's not going to help you so

01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:11,730
and again field data is only one part of

01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:13,740
the page speed signals so I would

01:17:11,730 --> 01:17:15,030
discourage this practice because it

01:17:13,740 --> 01:17:18,840
might not have the benefits that you

01:17:15,030 --> 01:17:20,670
think it has you can do it I just feel

01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:22,650
like you would invest a lot of time in

01:17:20,670 --> 01:17:27,000
making that solution work with not that

01:17:22,650 --> 01:17:32,940
much of a benefit so it's it's a better

01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:34,920
practice to just say yeah yeah all over

01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:39,740
all know each other just to click for

01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:42,360
for the ball ah great thank you a lot

01:17:39,740 --> 01:17:45,930
the last question from the audience is

01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:48,150
whether you can share your slides as I

01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:49,800
said in the beginning unfortunately it's

01:17:48,150 --> 01:17:52,590
against Google policy I can share the

01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:55,740
slides yeah I think this was recorded

01:17:52,590 --> 01:17:58,860
yeah it was recorded so directly for the

01:17:55,740 --> 01:18:01,050
the person who was asking this in the

01:17:58,860 --> 01:18:04,440
chat there will be recording it will be

01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:08,370
posted on the social media of the

01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:10,470
reactive meetups and as well as on the

01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:14,820
