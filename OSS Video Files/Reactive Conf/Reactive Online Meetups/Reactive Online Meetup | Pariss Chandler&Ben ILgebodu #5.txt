00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,940
experience with the current situation

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,870
and to what is happening in the US

00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:02,870
because connecting with the community

00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:05,180
across the ocean and sharing experiences

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:08,180
that's what we do that's what we do that

00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,689
and that's what we want to provide and

00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,570

00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:19,180
would like to welcome the Paris Chandler

00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:25,880

00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:32,650
forward to what you can tell us or I'm

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:36,409
happy to be here nice to meet everyone

00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,270
my name is paris athena i'm creator of

00:01:36,409 --> 00:01:41,810
lactic twitter and founder of lactic

00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:46,640
pipeline I live in Boston Massachusetts

00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:48,229
and yeah I'm just gonna talk about sort

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,649
of my experience the perspective and

00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:53,750
what's going on here it's really

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:55,579
complicated and it runs really deep and

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,320
it's way longer than the discussion

00:01:55,579 --> 00:02:02,210
we're about to have or what I'm about to

00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,040
explain so I know that then the news is

00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:08,780
portrayed differently in different parts

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:12,110
of the world and so I don't know if in

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:15,290
your area maybe the media is portraying

00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:17,280
things like you know with black lives

00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,830
matter that we're here protesting

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:26,069
and rioting and destroying buildings and

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:30,209
just acting crazy so what's really going

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,440
on is that black people in our allies

00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:36,000
allies come from all different

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,890
backgrounds we are protesting for you

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,390
know the end of police brutality for

00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:44,910
justice for equality for equity um black

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,110
people in America and I know in

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,830
different parts of the world as well

00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:54,870
we are not treated equally we you know a

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:59,070
lot of times we don't get justice and an

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,260
example of that is like you know George

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,680
Floyd has just passed because a police

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:07,050
officer kneeled into his neck for 8

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,510
minutes in 46 seconds and he ended up

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,819
passing away from that George Floyd is

00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,980
not the first black man to have been

00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:18,000
killed by a police officer this goes

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,890
back all the way I'm to slavery it's

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,489
just it's something that continuously

00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:28,079
happens and if you compare the treatment

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:33,180
of black people to white people in

00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:36,350
America it's completely different and um

00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,799
and it's really unfair and it's due to

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:47,570
like white privilege it's due to racism

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:50,130
it's due to prejudice discrimination and

00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,989
we're sick of it pretty much we're we're

00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:54,570
we're sick of being treated this way

00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,579
we're sick of you know police officers

00:03:54,570 --> 00:04:00,660
getting away with harming us and

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:04,019
targeting us and killing us and so this

00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,730
is why we protest now the way the media

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,380
portrays protesting is that we're

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,019
rioting and destroying buildings and

00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:14,940
burning things down this is how the

00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:17,789
media works police officers they they

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,840
will enter protests as a protester they

00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:23,700
come undercover as protesters and and so

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,840
do white nationalists white nationalists

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:29,190
are like you know the KKK the racists

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,020
they'll they'll come disguised as

00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:35,970
protesters and what

00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:38,280
do as they'll cause chaos by throwing

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,810
things at buildings starting fires and

00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,750
things like that and then you have the

00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:45,000
black youth and other people who are at

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,800
the protest there there are the protests

00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,300
in rage they're angry they're angry at

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,580
how their community is being treated in

00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,650
this country that says you know they

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,539
they have equal rights for all when they

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,449
don't so you have people there that are

00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:59,879
angry and now you know you see looting

00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:02,789
going on and people throwing things and

00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:06,120
breaking things and then they join in

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:09,330
with that and is that right no but at

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,539
the same time you know this is how you

00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:14,009
get people riled up like they're angry

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:15,599
they want to take out their frustrations

00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,280
because no matter what we do things

00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:19,139
don't change for us in this country no

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,909
matter how many times we protest how

00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,610
many times we riot how many times we

00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:28,560
speak our minds nothing seems to change

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:32,310
and so you know so they join in on these

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,539
looting in riots and then police come in

00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:36,900
and they start shooting rubber bullets

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:38,310
and you know amazing people and things

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,930
like that and that's what the media is

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,650
gonna show you they're gonna show you

00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:45,229
what happens after someone else starts

00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:50,310
all of this chaos they're gonna show you

00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:52,169
black people you know acting acting wild

00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,430
acting crazy being angry that's what the

00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:54,449
media is gonna portray to you but

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,979
they're not gonna show you how it

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,340
started and the reason for that is that

00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,099
so that they can continue to portray

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,020
this stereotype that you know black

00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:06,509
people are angry and dangerous and

00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,279
violent and this is why they get

00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:10,469
arrested this is why they go to jail

00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:14,099
this is why they're killed by police

00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:16,500
like they try to justify our anger by

00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:22,440
portraying something that isn't true to

00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:24,240
you yeah this is this a lot a really

00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,979
long discussion and it's it's really

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,259
angering I don't know I think I think

00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:34,259
Ben can jump in with more to say and I'd

00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,719
love to get into deeper discussion it's

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,009
just there's so many ways we can talk

00:06:36,719 --> 00:06:40,949
about there's so many different things

00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:44,960
we can discuss so I'm gonna end it for

00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:49,550
me and then Ben can jump in with more

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:52,190
yes thank you Ferris for that like

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,280
excellent explanation about that the

00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,340
riots and protests really that have been

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,940
happening good thank you for the

00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:03,919
organizers for inviting me I'm used to

00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,780
actually sharing about and speaking at

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,930
conferences about react and typescript

00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:10,910
so this is a little different experience

00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:13,610
for me a little more serious obviously

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,880
but just introduced to myself my name is

00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,949
Ben I live with my family in California

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,930
in the States

00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:22,940
I'm a principal front-end engineer at

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:25,099
stitch fix as you may have guessed from

00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:29,710
the t-shirt were an online clothing

00:07:25,099 --> 00:07:33,979
service that's in the US and the UK so

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:35,270
the last two three weeks or so since

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:38,210
George Floyd's

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:41,449
murder as first mentioned they've been

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,780
crazy and I've had my own experiences

00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:45,919
Paris's that our own experiences

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,909
everyone has had their own experiences

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,430
so you know we're coming here trying to

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:54,500
explain what's going on but it's our own

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,229
experiences we don't speak for all black

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,849
people because they all have their own

00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,760
experiences so we just want to kind of

00:07:58,849 --> 00:08:06,139
give you information about what's going

00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:08,720
on and really in the last three or four

00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:11,270
months there have been three murders so

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,419
our George Florence mortar and main is

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,970
kind of what sparked all these but

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:19,699
Brianna Taylor was killed in March and

00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:20,570
Ahmad Arbor Barbaria was killed in

00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:23,820
February

00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:27,330
both similarly

00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,910
racist I would call it activities so and

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:34,169
there been many many many many many many

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:38,580
times before that we died because of

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:42,169
police brutality so my earliest memory

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:47,640
in fact was a man named Rodney King in

00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:51,150
LA who was beat hundreds of times by

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,790
police in 1991 so we're talking about 30

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:56,820
years ago I was seven years old at the

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,250
time and that's my first memory of like

00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,690
wow because of the color of my skin I

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:06,360
could be treated differently and in fact

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:09,750
people look at me differently and I may

00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,030
not be safe because of it so these

00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,270
protests that have happened is like the

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,340
country saying finally like this is a

00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,050
problem and this needs to stop and

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:21,960
something needs to change

00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:23,910
so like Peres said I don't know exactly

00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:27,150
what you all are hearing from the media

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,520
what they are telling you and yes there

00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:31,440
have been riots but for the most part

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,590
they've been protest and they've been

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,920
peaceful protests so just the other day

00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:39,240
on the Golden Gate Bridge half of the

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,300
bridge was covered with people just

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,920
walking and blocking traffic and

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,390
protesting against what's going on so

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:50,970
it's been peaceful it's been I would say

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:53,790
annoying to people Mabley but it has to

00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:55,860
have an effect on people for people to

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:00,910
actually understand and appreciate

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:04,360
what's going on so

00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,370
it's and it's not just black people now

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,520
protesting as it has been in the past

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,250
it's been allies as well people who also

00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:14,860
agree that this needs to stop so it's

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,720
just a sign showing that something needs

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:21,610
to change it can't be the same way again

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:25,840
and this no longer can go back to normal

00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:28,330
so it's like my hope that progress

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,840
against police brutality and all these

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:35,200
prejudice that have happened that this

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:38,350
will look back to 2020 and see it as an

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,000
inflection point of just like we see the

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,180
civil rights movement in the United

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,630
States so when Martin Luther King

00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:51,240
unfortunately was murdered in the 1960s

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:54,540
it was a sign of no longer having

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,630
separation between races that was

00:10:54,540 --> 00:11:01,150
legislated we can look back and see that

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:06,240
this time will will be a time Laurie we

00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:09,400
move from that we can my worry is that

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,770
you know two months from now when Koga

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,470
dies down and we're no longer confined

00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:17,790
to our houses that people will forget

00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:21,670
that they'll move on and be distracted

00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:24,580
but I do have hope because like a lot of

00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,980
my co-workers a lot of my friends for

00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:29,020
the first time have reached out to me

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,240
and actually asked me how I was doing

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,910
with all things are going on so I think

00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:37,600
there's a realization that there's

00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:40,800
really a problem and I really really I

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,330
really need

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:47,339
this to change because I am the target

00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:50,730
person like even if I'm not doing

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:53,790
anything wrong I can have the cops

00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,370
called on me and then anything can

00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:59,160
happen like when I walk around my

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:02,010
neighborhood with my kids or even by

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,950
myself I have to make sure that I don't

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:07,440
look threatening at all like if it's

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,810
cold outside I take off my hood on my

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,480
city I can't have my hoodie on because I

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:15,000
may look threatening I can't have my hat

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,480
turned backwards you know I tried to

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:21,839
look as much as I belong so that someone

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:24,600
doesn't get the idea that oh he doesn't

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,760
belong here let me call the cops then

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,709
who knows what they've told the cops and

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,260
who knows what kind of cops are gonna

00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:34,230
show up and then you know my life can be

00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:38,310
taken away from me just from doing

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:40,890
nothing basically so that's the kind of

00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,589
world that when I see all of these

00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:47,250
events happen like it reminds me that

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:50,220
I'm not completely safe and it's all

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,899
because of deep-seated biases and

00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,980
prejudices that have happened since

00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:57,930
slavery time in the 1700s and it's just

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,800
trickled down from there and we could

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:04,890
talk more about it but it needs to

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,050
change so like what I ask people even

00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,850
not in the United States it's that I

00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:12,990
challenged them to look at themselves

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:15,839
and see what biases and prejudices you

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,570
have within you because we all have them

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,060
right the question is whether or not you

00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:24,270
hold somebody down because of those

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:27,540
prejudices right so we can be aware of

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,190
them once we know then we can try to not

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:33,000
let it affect how we treat other people

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:36,000
and then as a result we can all have

00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,860
little steps to improvement and then

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,160
when we put all those little stuff

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:47,160
together hopefully big change happens so

00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:51,930
I was asked like what am what am i doing

00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:54,390
to try to help with this did this cause

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:58,830
and what I'm trying to do

00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:02,280
is I'm trying to mentor young black

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:06,720
youth in the area to try to help make

00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:10,440
things better because growing up and a

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,860
lot of black youth right now they don't

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,930
they don't have role models that are

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,240
role models besides people who are

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,610
entertainers like they believe the only

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:23,880
way that I could be successful as if I'm

00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:26,550
an athlete if I'm a singer if I'm the

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,160
dancer if I'm an actor that that's all

00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:32,910
they see and I want them to be able to

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:36,120
see other exact other examples so I try

00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,990
to be that myself but then also point

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,780
them to other people

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:42,030
so mentoring is kind of the way that

00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,130
I've tried to help and I want to get

00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:46,410
more black people and tech as well

00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,810
because if there's more people if we

00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:51,960
have more representation hopefully some

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:55,470
of those biases and prejudices will go

00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:58,050
away so yeah that's what I wanted to

00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:01,080
share yeah thanks for listening again I

00:14:58,050 --> 00:15:04,050
appreciate your attention thanks again

00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:07,710
to the team for letting me share Andy

00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:10,490
Mishka Sarah Mickey for allowing me to

00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:16,350
be here and now we can turn it over to

00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:18,660
some Q&A for those who have questions we

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:21,720
will proceed to the Q&A but first of all

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:25,170
let me thank you for sharing your views

00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,600
opinions experiences like it's quite

00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:34,070
difficult for me in Europe to to hear

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:37,610
that because like I cannot imagine but

00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:40,290
but I could hear a little bit of

00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,390
positivity there in those peaceful

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,280
protests and the communities other

00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:49,530
communities joining in and and I hope

00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:55,530
and fingers crossed that it will change

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:58,410
and and that everyone will have an equal

00:15:55,530 --> 00:16:01,370
right and nobody will have to just be

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,980
afraid to walk on the street and just

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:07,050
just do not look threatening for

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,100
whatever reason so thank you thank you

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:10,649
very much

00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:16,500
joining in like it's been awesome thank

00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:19,410
you and I don't see any questions in Q&A

00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,139
but I have one question I'm curious

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:24,870
because I know bandit you are in

00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:28,709
California Paris you are in Boston and

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:32,850
is the situation and different on East

00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:35,940
Coast and West Coast like is there is

00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:40,529
there a difference or is it the same

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:44,509
everywhere you be the response to it or

00:16:40,529 --> 00:16:47,790
the situation also the situation like

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:50,160
because even in my country as small as

00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:53,490
Slovakia the difference between like the

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,490
capital and the other regions is huge

00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:59,759
so so how is it in the US and also the

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:03,029
situation and the responses I have seen

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,530
the riots in Minnesota but as you said

00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:10,829
like that's not the whole picture

00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:13,709
obviously I'm at least for over here I'm

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,600
Boston I want to say that only maybe

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:20,819
that it's smaller because there's not as

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:25,049
many people um but I mean like in Boston

00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,880
like we've had few riots not as big as

00:17:25,049 --> 00:17:29,640
like what's happening in Minneapolis and

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,740
other areas but you know we've had also

00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,169
peaceful protests like a lot of them and

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,940
the tons of people show up and they're

00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:39,900
marching and protesting and it's

00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:42,030
peaceful and everything but as for like

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,270
what's happening with police I want to

00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:48,720
say that happens everywhere um you know

00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:51,000
in even in my own little city in Boston

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,490
because I live in Cambridge specifically

00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,070
you know we have racism within our own

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,960
Police Department and we're trying to

00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:59,610
fight that and that's on a smaller scale

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,740
that's not even the whole city of Boston

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,400
you know and so I feel like that's just

00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,520
what it is in all areas of the US I

00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:13,260
don't know agree then yeah totally I

00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:15,900
mean I think what this has shown is that

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,180
there's racism everywhere right so this

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:20,710
could happen anywhere and

00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,720
[Music]

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,659
we've had protests like I live in the

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,629
Bay Area so the bay area is pretty large

00:18:25,659 --> 00:18:30,429
7 8 million people and there are lots of

00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:32,110
different cities in the Bay Area and

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,409
each one of those cities have had their

00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:37,629
own little protests they walk from one

00:18:35,409 --> 00:18:39,460
place to city home like that's kind of

00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:41,889
been the thing that everybody's been

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,960
doing and it's happening everywhere so

00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:45,850
that's encouraging to me because it's

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,769
not just the big cities it's not just

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:51,009
where things have already happened it's

00:18:47,769 --> 00:18:52,809
like people are really showing that they

00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:57,309
care and they don't want this to happen

00:18:52,809 --> 00:18:59,710
again but yeah I mean I showed my I

00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:02,529
shared my experience with how I feel

00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:06,549
walking around like that happens

00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:08,649
anywhere and really what also happens

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:13,330
everywhere in the United States is this

00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:15,309
concept of I mean I guess I'm gonna get

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,059
into details but this concept of what

00:19:15,309 --> 00:19:21,190
it's called white flight so what happens

00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:23,440
it happens all over the country is that

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:27,690
there'll be a neighborhood predominantly

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,119
white you'll have some black people who

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:33,009
somehow whatever are able to make it

00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,889
into these white neighborhoods that are

00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:38,889
considered affluent or you know above

00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:41,379
and then what's those black people

00:19:38,889 --> 00:19:43,869
enough black people join all the white

00:19:41,379 --> 00:19:45,970
people leave and then it becomes a black

00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:48,399
neighborhood and the cycle continues and

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:51,100
continues and that happened in my

00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:53,649
hometown in Houston I'm certain it

00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:57,159
happened in Boston it's happening in the

00:19:53,649 --> 00:20:00,039
area as well so it's like and that's all

00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,509
driven off of biases because you know we

00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:03,340
can't live around black people black

00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:06,610
people are scary etc is that our

00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,659
experiment so that's exactly what happen

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,720
that's happening everywhere

00:20:07,659 --> 00:20:13,059
gentrification like it's just happening

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,610
everywhere you know what my small city

00:20:13,059 --> 00:20:17,610
of Cambridge it used to be so many black

00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,950
and brown people was so diverse

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:24,549
um and then more white people started

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:26,379
moving in and you know the prices were

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:27,700
raised and black people and brown people

00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:30,429
couldn't afford it so they had to move

00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,889
out and now the culture that we used to

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:34,510
have like food stores of like Spanish

00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:38,080
food southern food like all

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:39,460
diversity is is gone you know and I

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,820
don't see a lot of people who look like

00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:45,880
me now it's been taken over and all of

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:49,390
my people have left and you know that's

00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,000
just happening everywhere and then you

00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:54,940
know then you have like this community

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,250
of mainly white people who now they're

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,410
they're dominant their word is more

00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,270
important over the smaller voices of the

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,190
black and brown communities here you

00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:05,950
know they're taking over in the school

00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:09,370
district they're taking over and jobs

00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:12,429
and I don't know it's it's this whole

00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:18,940
ripple effect and it's everywhere it's

00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:20,080
happening everywhere as well yeah I have

00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,380
seen this in New York

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:28,840
pretty much when I was there like

00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:31,000
gentrification yeah thank you thank you

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,850
for your answer and we have one more

00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,900
question here what could we do in

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:40,030
Slovakia to a state in the u.s.

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,320
charities fancy recommend education

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,600
activities how can we reach out to

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:48,520
community do you do it to our community

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:52,299
in the u.s. yeah so I think so first of

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:54,940
all you wanna don't listen to the news I

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,790
think what you do is revolt yourself

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,290
around communities of the people going

00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,000
through it so you need to revolve

00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:04,150
yourself around the black community

00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,090
around the brown community you know you

00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:08,830
have social networks you have Twitter

00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:11,200
which is a great place to get involved

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:12,549
with people who look differently than

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,049
you people who have different

00:22:12,549 --> 00:22:18,340
experiences than you get involved with

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:20,020
those networks you know you can continue

00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:22,480
to like donate and bring awareness

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,900
through your own platform so you can

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,600
speak on it yourself you can contribute

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,400
to the conversation you can donate money

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,070
to different organizations that are

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,540
trying to empower black people you can

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,419
do things like that but you you

00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:38,890
definitely want to have people who look

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:41,380
differently than you get them within

00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:44,080
your network like you know engage with

00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,070
them build relationships with take

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,540
advantage of those types of

00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:47,920
opportunities that's really important

00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:50,670
because then you're going to

00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,680
get it from you know you're gonna get

00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:55,120
valuable information that's honest

00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,640
you're not gonna be listening to the

00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,240
media who wants to portray something

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:04,770
that probably isn't true you know some

00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:07,420
yeah or at least not the complete truth

00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,170
yeah another part I would add that's

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:10,950
perfect

00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:15,280
the other point I would add is just

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:18,130
calling out racism when you see it so

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:20,380
that's like a great way so there are a

00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:23,950
lot of what they call microaggressions

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:27,880
or micro racism's that people have like

00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:30,160
oh your name is interesting or all kinds

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,800
of sort of certain things and when you

00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:34,990
hear it instead of laughing with them or

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,450
being silent actually calling it out and

00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:41,050
as we kind of bring more and more of

00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:45,040
those things to the light then hopefully

00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:48,220
it can't exist as much and we all become

00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:50,560
better because of it yeah bring

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,580
awareness educate your peers got

00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:58,060
remember with our communities you know

00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:01,600
great great answers I hope that mati is

00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:03,850
also satisfied with the answer thank you
