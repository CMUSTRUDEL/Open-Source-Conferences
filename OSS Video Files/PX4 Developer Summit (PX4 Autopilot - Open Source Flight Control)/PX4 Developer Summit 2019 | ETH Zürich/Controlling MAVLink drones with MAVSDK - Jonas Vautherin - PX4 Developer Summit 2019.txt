Title: Controlling MAVLink drones with MAVSDK - Jonas Vautherin - PX4 Developer Summit 2019
Publication date: 2019-07-03
Playlist: PX4 Developer Summit 2019 | ETH ZÃ¼rich
Description: 
	Jonas Vautherin
Software Engineer, Auterion
MAVSDK Maintainer

This session will be dedicated to learn about the roadmap of MAVSDK and how to use it. It will start by providing an overview of MAVSDK (previously called 'DronecodeSDK'), its design, supported features and roadmap for the future changes to come. We will then move to live demos, that participants should be able to reproduce on their computer. Preferred languages and platforms for the workshop are C++, Python and Swift on Linux and macOS, but Windows users are welcome. Ideally, people wanting to reproduce the demos should be able to run SITL on their computer before the session (be it jmavsim or gazebo). At the end, you should be able to write your own code taking off and flying a simple mission on a simulator. It is suitable for any potential contributor or adopter willing to know whether MAVSDK is a good alternative for their use-case.
