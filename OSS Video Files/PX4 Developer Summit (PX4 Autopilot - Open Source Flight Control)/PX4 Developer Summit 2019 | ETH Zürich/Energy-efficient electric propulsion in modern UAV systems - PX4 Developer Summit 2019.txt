Helping enterprises around the world create aerial transport of the 21st century: electric, autonomous, dependable.

Alexander Sysoev
VP Hardware Engineering, Zubax

Zubax Robotics has developed an integrated motor control circuit that enables third-party hardware engineers to design sophisticated electric drives using its cutting-edge field-oriented control technology. With this solution, a regular hardware engineer without prior experience with motor control applications can design a custom electric drive in a few days. The motor control technology utilizes new patent-pending approaches to digital signal processing that facilitate reduced heat rejection, thereby increasing the energy efficiency of the drive and enabling higher endurance. Extensive empirical testing indicates that innovative electric drives built on the Zubax motor control technology outperform similar solutions based on TI InstaSPIN (which is widely used by numerous well-known vendors such as DJI and T-Motor).
