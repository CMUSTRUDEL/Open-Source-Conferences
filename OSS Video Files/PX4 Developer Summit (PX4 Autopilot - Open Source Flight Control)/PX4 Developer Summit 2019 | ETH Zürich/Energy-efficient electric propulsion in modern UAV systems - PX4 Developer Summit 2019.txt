Helping enterprises around the world create aerial transport of the 21st century: electric, autonomous, dependable.

Alexander Sysoev
VP Hardware Engineering, Zubax

Zubax Robotics has developed an integrated motor control circuit that enables third-party hardware engineers to design sophisticated electric drives using its cutting-edge field-oriented control technology. With this solution, a regular hardware engineer without prior experience with motor control applications can design a custom electric drive in a few days. The motor control technology utilizes new patent-pending approaches to digital signal processing that facilitate reduced heat rejection, thereby increasing the energy efficiency of the drive and enabling higher endurance. Extensive empirical testing indicates that innovative electric drives built on the Zubax motor control technology outperform similar solutions based on TI InstaSPIN (which is widely used by numerous well-known vendors such as DJI and T-Motor).

	00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:15,130
so we perceive that the metric

00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:18,730
used in modern drones

00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:22,050
among adopters of peak so is kind of

00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:25,420
stagnating and we perhaps good offer

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,090
solution to this I'm going to start with

00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,680
the basics and around the middle of the

00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,410
presentation I'm going to explain how is

00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,790
it related to peaks form

00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:39,280
so on this picture you can see no he is

00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,829
launching an ancient drone to find land

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,670
during the Great Flood

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:44,470
obviously the effort wasn't very

00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,180
successful because this particular piece

00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,790
of engine technology which some of you

00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:52,600
may recognize cannot boast sufficient

00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:57,970
endurance so that was quite unfortunate

00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,220
and why is that because the energy

00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:03,420
resource is available on board or kind

00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,350
of extremely scarce because of the

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:11,110
shortcomings of modern battery

00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:13,119
technology and briefly we can show the

00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,369
energy conversion pipeline like this

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,509
major losses occur in the motor

00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:21,789
controller and in the motor itself and

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,530
add Zhu box we were able to develop a

00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:27,340
new motor control technology which

00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:31,960
allowed us to reduce energy losses in

00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:34,149
the controller and in the motor by 9 to

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,679
15 percent depending on the baseline

00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:38,350
depending on what you compare it against

00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:40,149
which is quite substantial because that

00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:43,600
brings us very close to the theoretical

00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:46,569
limit and this this improvement is

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,859
possible things to new digital signal

00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:53,709
processing techniques that we have

00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:56,619
developed in-house this this table

00:01:53,709 --> 00:01:58,719
outlines a basic test that we have

00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:01,899
conducted basically we took our

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,469
technology integrated drive based on our

00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:06,579
solution which is tilted on the Left we

00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:12,130
call it saddle de graça

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:14,050
and on the competitor was a product with

00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:15,910
a propulsion system a particular

00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,980
configuration that was used by one of

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,959
our customers so it's a very very

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:22,810
practical test and you may see that both

00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,090
solutions leverage the same propeller

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,630
which is important because it ensures

00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:30,520
that the comparison is

00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:33,370
the propeller does not affect the end

00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,620
result of the test and this is the test

00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:41,350
rig our integrated drives a dual across

00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:43,480
so the red one installed onto a test a

00:02:41,350 --> 00:02:46,200
test bench manufactured by our C

00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,440
benchmark and this is the competitor

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,850
again

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,460
looks pretty standard and the results of

00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:57,130
that particular test are staggering you

00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:59,820
can see that there is a very substantial

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:04,300
difference in energy efficiency and

00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:06,400
practically that means that any drone

00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:09,090
that is based on obsolete propulsion

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,400
technology can benefit of increased with

00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:16,660
endurance by simply swapping its

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,210
propulsion Hardware from legacy to a

00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,800
solution when the read by touch so

00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,590
that's something that should be kept in

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,770
mind also vibration is an important

00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:29,200
important factor and the vibration is

00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:32,140
caused not only by mechanical disbalance

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:37,240
but also in certain cases by vibrations

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:40,090
induced by the drive itself and that is

00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:44,740
particularly important for the forepeak

00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:46,510
so doctors last year we run a survey

00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,280
with drone code which have already

00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,110
mentioned in my previous presentation it

00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,610
was very insightful and by the way we

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,090
can share results of this survey if you

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,750
care about it and it revealed that vast

00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:00,760
majority of Peaks for doctors actually

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:04,050
leverage obsolete motor control

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,520
technology which means that many many

00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,380
companies represented by people present

00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:12,760
here could possibly benefit seriously

00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:15,010
from our from our technologies but it

00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:18,930
will be unfair to compare our solution

00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:23,260
against against obsolete technology so

00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,960
here's another comparison some of you

00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,490
may know that the gie 2000 is a pretty

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,130
advanced product based on

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,420
state-of-the-art motor control

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:33,310
technology developed by Texas

00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,710
Instruments it is known as insta spin

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:41,560
and actually the same technology is used

00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:42,370
by some other vendors and we can show

00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,320
quite

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,090
significant improvements in energy

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,199
conversion efficiency you can see the

00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:55,360
power levels at the bottom the the rotor

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,240
speed was identical for both tests and

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,290
we can show that our solution dissipates

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:06,930
less power

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:10,419
which again enables higher entrance so

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,910
such obsolete technology is this well

00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:15,430
known that it was used for construction

00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,990
site inspections such as for example

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,710
this photograph was taken in ancient

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,510
Egypt where this ancient drone

00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,350
leveraging six-step commutation

00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:29,340
technology was used for site inspection

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:34,060
I know that 2gr has really improved this

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:35,860
this particular domain since then but

00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,990
this is not what modern drones look like

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,960
modern drones look like this this is one

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,610
of our customers some of you may have

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,690
heard about this company the leverage

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:49,450
Peaks for as well one of their one of

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:53,789
the most important features of this

00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:57,310
product is its flight they've reached

00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:00,010
the endurance metrics of two hours

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,789
without payload and I believe it's one

00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,860
hour eating nails with payload which is

00:06:02,789 --> 00:06:07,030
which is significant and it's it's

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,280
important to keep in mind that this

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:14,560
outstanding product is based on our

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:17,889
propulsion technology so other vendors

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,530
are unlikely to be able to develop an

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:23,940
equivalently capable solution in house

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,320
because motor control is very hard and

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,060
development of custom motor control

00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:34,180
solution requires substantial investment

00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:36,479
so what we are offering basically is an

00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:40,800
integrated circuit integrated solution a

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:45,310
model which can be built in into your

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,950
custom propulsion hardware allowing any

00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:49,210
electrical engineer without prior

00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:51,460
experience with motor control

00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:54,789
applications to relatively easily build

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:56,069
a sophisticated motor control unit the

00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:59,410
idea is that

00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:01,210
90% of complexity of motor control of

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,210
motor control application is hidden

00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:07,150
inside the software and digital signal

00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:12,970
processing circuits whereas the power

00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:14,069
electronics itself is quite simple again

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,340
same idea

00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:21,250
demonstrated here on this on the shelf

00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:25,090
purchase a forward we basically allow or

00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,770
vendors of modern vehicles to leverage a

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:31,449
lens technology but at the same time

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:34,750
reduce time to market this is what it

00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:38,590
looks like the peaks or beige that you

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:43,500
all received few days ago it's for scale

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:43,500
here and this is the model at the bottom

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,759
we're going to touch all the most a

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,440
little bit later you can approach the

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,909
stable during the lunch break which

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,039
supposed and right after this

00:07:54,909 --> 00:08:01,509
presentation and we are going to show

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:04,090
you the the hardware so some people

00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:06,520
might mistakenly believe that is you

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,720
need this this module is heavy but the

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,880
reason for that is very simple it is we

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,509
integrated it contains the was the

00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,070
microcontroller motor control software

00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:23,710
digital signal processing algorithms

00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:25,990
signal conditioning circuits transistor

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:29,979
driver DC DC converter and very

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:34,750
integrated so its size is justified and

00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:38,260
as you will see soon in a weight of

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:43,570
section this presentation it's quite

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:46,120
quite flexible so on on the on the part

00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,930
of reliability I should also emphasize

00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,290
some of our non technical features every

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:56,140
unit that we manufacture is equipped

00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:59,320
with manufacturing test log which is

00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:03,310
available online majority of components

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:05,949
are qualified by ecq 100 200 we

00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:09,300
obviously provides W Intendant you

00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:12,090
weekend and legacy RC PWM as well

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,830
and there are some little recording

00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,830
features that are to be available later

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:28,110
this video briefly demonstrates how our

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:31,140
solution can support basically arbitrary

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:37,730
BLDC motors by means of automatic

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:37,730
identification I wish I could scold

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,070
so the video is a bit spell what we are

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:55,070
showing here is the three forward

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,450
process of installation of our graphical

00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:01,120
user interface which allows you to

00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:05,360
connect to the motor controller to the

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:09,860
to its firmware identify the connected

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:14,000
motor that's basically a fully automated

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:15,920
system identification from this step our

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,720
motor control system learns the

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,420
properties of the motor and adjusts

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,810
itself for optimal performance here we

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:25,250
are connecting to the motor configuring

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:29,230
some basic parameters such as the number

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,730
of poles and the rated current and

00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:35,600
everything else is deduced automatically

00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:41,240
we just launch motor identification we

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:48,410
wait a few minutes we still wait we wait

00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:50,110
a bit more and when it's done it's ready

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:52,579
to go

00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:57,709
very minimal manual tuning is required

00:10:52,579 --> 00:10:59,089
if required at all and we provide full

00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:00,770
stack of solution starting with

00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:02,959
integrated models up to complete

00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:05,899
integrated drives with motors and

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,310
propellers in one product which

00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:12,620
obviously can be tuned and

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:14,750
pre-configured and as I said we support

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:16,820
legacy interfaces as well so our

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:25,800
propulsion systems are usable in legacy

00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:27,959
systems as a drop-in replacement so

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,350
now my colleague Alexander is going to

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,779
briefly outline our or the advantages of

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:37,139
our open hardware reference designs

00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:40,679
which are licensed under creative

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:44,129
commons share-alike version 4.0 meaning

00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:56,429
that basically they can be leveraged it

00:11:44,129 --> 00:11:58,110
arbitrarily in custom designs so Espiral

00:11:56,429 --> 00:12:01,009
said there are two main approaches to

00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:03,269
drive build see motors the classic one

00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:04,709
which is six step commutation and was

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:07,499
invented like three hundred years ago

00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:09,269
and is used everywhere now and modern

00:12:07,499 --> 00:12:11,579
one the modern approach is in pseudo

00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:15,149
control it is much more complex it

00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:18,110
requires much software effort but it

00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:20,819
brings advantages of high efficiency and

00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:23,879
lower parasitic effects like vibrations

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:27,059
audible noise and so on and let's focus

00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,259
on design in the later one type of easy

00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,369
because there is no point in doing

00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,689
something that was done hundred times I

00:12:31,369 --> 00:12:36,329
am I guess

00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:38,249
the only one person in the world who had

00:12:36,329 --> 00:12:40,829
an opportunity to design something huge

00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:42,959
metal contact metals pilot was talking

00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:45,209
about before and I can assure you it's

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,829
pretty simple there's much simpler than

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,470
designing the whole you see from from

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:52,139
scratch here you can see the lowest

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:56,759
powerful the lowest power rate it is see

00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:58,470
based in mitochondria and the purpose of

00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,809
the thing is to demonstrate that it can

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:04,619
be pretty compact

00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:07,259
this thing has dimensions of basically

00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:09,619
of a module it's a bit a little bit

00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:12,660
bigger than the module and it can be

00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:16,019
embedded in telic fpv racers or

00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:18,299
something like that also have a bigger

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,209
one design this is called sub dually

00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:24,299
this is in fact an integrated ray drive

00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:29,549
and should include motor on top of that

00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:32,519
but obviously here it isn't and it it is

00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:36,029
a very simple design as well it consists

00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,860
basically of a couple PCBs one is the

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:39,699
connector PCB for mitochondria and just

00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:42,519
a power stage with most

00:13:39,699 --> 00:13:46,149
and capacitors nothing more pretty

00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:50,350
simple and also got a bigger one design

00:13:46,149 --> 00:13:52,600
it looks similar but if Sidhu Lee is

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,299
rated for about 500 watts of continuous

00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,660
power this one it's a bit bigger and is

00:13:55,299 --> 00:14:01,299
rated for up to 2 kilowatts so you can

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,899
get about 20 kilos of thrust with this

00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:06,519
link and proper motor propeller and

00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,769
again the design is super simple

00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:14,859
basically a module and a bunch of fat

00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:17,319
nothing else so I must say that all the

00:14:14,859 --> 00:14:20,529
designs usually take about from two to

00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:25,119
three weeks to design and require

00:14:20,529 --> 00:14:28,359
absolutely zero software effort and it

00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:34,139
usually requires maybe max two Hardware

00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:36,910
revisions to get you running you can

00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:38,829
come and see and touch all these designs

00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,749
here on the table they are not because

00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:43,079
you can't see them from from the

00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:43,079
distance

00:14:46,660 --> 00:15:12,790
[Applause]

00:14:53,670 --> 00:15:14,940
any questions in front Bechet matrix any

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:17,680
performance metrics because for

00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,870
multicopters is very important to have

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,090
fast reaction times of the motor and

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:26,320
high torque yes indeed and these lead

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:27,610
usually to less efficiency so the reason

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,930
we didn't include them because they are

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,640
comparable to the current state of the

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:32,530
art and they are sufficient for modern

00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,970
applications so there is not much to

00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:36,100
show but if you're interested we can

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,440
actually share the detailed data from

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,110
that experiment really if you could just

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:46,290
email at us at info at the box at home

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,290
we can just share raw data sets

00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,990
any more questions

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,240
so thank you guys

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,899
[Applause]

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,370
