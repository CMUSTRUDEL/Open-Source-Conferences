everyone imean Galloway with NXP

00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:35,510
semiconductor and Gerald yes so we're

00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,719
only a semiconductor company we make

00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:41,210
chips we don't make drones a lot of you

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,190
are software people may not be familiar

00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,290
with nxb

00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:48,460
the roots are motorola at one point

00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:52,670
became Freescale Semiconductor Philips

00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:54,710
mind Netherlands became nxp and now not

00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,600
that long ago few years back we merged

00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,210
became the new and XP so it's a

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,060
combination of all those technologies in

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,129
one place or a very broad line supplier

00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:08,960
with microcontrollers microprocessor

00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:10,640
sensors RF power connectivity we do a

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,439
six for people we've got foundries

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,360
around the world and that's our core

00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:15,560
business so it's quite a large company

00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,970
we're the largest supplier to the

00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:22,030
automotive industry and focus on things

00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:24,229
like a Dass and self-driving cars

00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:27,590
functional safety we supply a lot of

00:01:24,229 --> 00:01:29,869
medical customers we've an industrial so

00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:31,970
that's really when people come to nxp

00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:34,790
worden they're not looking for the

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,229
absolutely cheapest part they're looking

00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,260
for parts that they know they can build

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,450
into products and have a long life a lot

00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:45,409
of our parts components we guarantee 10

00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,540
or 15 years and we just announced that

00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,580
we're acquiring the wireless assets of

00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,470
Marvell for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi going

00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,060
forward

00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:55,580
but who are we or like why are we

00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:59,630
involved with drone with px4 and drone

00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,520
code and and really the drone team is

00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:03,700
what's driving it it's not we're

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,990
actually in the process of sort of

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,369
taking all this back to our corporate

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:10,879
and saying hey this is something we need

00:02:07,369 --> 00:02:12,500
to focus on it's a difficult sell

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,430
because obviously the drone industry is

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,680
tiny compared to hundreds of thousands

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:21,860
of vehicle pieces that are made every

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,380
every month so we're a small team inside

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,810
of NXP we're not NXP thousands and

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,760
thousand people were five people

00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,950
and some students and think and we we

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,709
pull upon resources as best we can

00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:37,730
so we're really committed in and

00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:42,349
involved as personally to the open

00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:43,849
source community and we feel from a

00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:44,930
strategy point of view but you know

00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:46,610
we're not going to compete on the

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,989
cheapest low-end stuff but our strategy

00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,280
point of view is let's let's look at

00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:52,099
what we can bring in terms of high

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,000
reliably high reliability hardware with

00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:57,290
long life for drones and Rovers and I

00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,640
said it before we're not a drone

00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,500
manufacturer so all the things we're

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,330
going to show here today are actually

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,540
just reference designs where we want to

00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:08,299
help enable it going forward into the

00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,340
into the industry in the community and

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:13,459
the other part that's different about

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,319
having a drone team here is that we can

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,590
provide sort of unprecedented

00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:21,230
unprecedented access into NXP as a

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,690
corporate body and all the things we do

00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,910
typically small companies are dealt

00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:27,890
through distributors and distributors

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:30,080
reach salespeople etc and not they don't

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:33,109
get to talk to the engineers that are

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,530
busy servicing continental or Volkswagen

00:03:33,109 --> 00:03:37,970
or Toyota but having said that there's

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,700
challenges that remain I mean we have

00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:43,670
these amazing parts on the horizon that

00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,500
we just can't get yet until until it's

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,100
getting over that that hurdle with and

00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:51,230
the lead customers but we do our best

00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,819
all right so the two objectives I trying

00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,650
to think what are the objectives here

00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,560
one is to show you some things we're

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,389
working with some some of stuff and then

00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,639
let you know that we're here and we're

00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:02,600
friendly and you can talk with us and

00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:04,850
all that

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,549
Jerald go in into more detail on some of

00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:08,690
the projects we've been involved in

00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:11,750
thank you

00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:13,670
your first short introduction to myself

00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:17,510
I'm Garrett picker I'm located in

00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:19,940
Hamburg Germany I'm Austrian living in

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:23,860
Hamburg being in Switzerland trying to

00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:27,139
talk English okay that's how it is but

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:30,490
to show or give you an example on our

00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:33,320
commitment we are not only deep in ICS

00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,780
we also deep in the drones so we're not

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,250
just talking about what we know from

00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,550
others those hardware you see here was

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:43,030
Bill

00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:44,840
by myself so we are building the stuff

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:45,860
ourselves we are testing this stuff

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:48,770
ourself

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:53,750
we're flying this stuff ourselves so we

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:57,710
have some experience some about the DLR

00:04:53,750 --> 00:05:00,290
project we have two representatives from

00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,900
DLR here as well so if you have

00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:08,330
questions on that you can ask it on so

00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:14,240
hi Nicholas and donors that's Angela

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:18,470
internal projects and partners are in

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,230
there and doing the project to get

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:26,720
Abdullah who is in there and what's the

00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:30,170
project about so we have fly necks that

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:35,330
is a company who provides geographical

00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:40,610
data and services for drone he had a

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:42,440
registration for geographical data in

00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:45,650
principle but in principle it's a whole

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:50,450
workflow infrastructure they have copter

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:53,150
craft to is doing a multi-link system

00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:57,020
for remote control and telemetry with

00:05:53,150 --> 00:06:01,160
DFS determine yes base authority or

00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:04,030
Therrien is in there winter off is a

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:07,190
network within the Hamburg area

00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:09,520
connecting drone operators with

00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:13,010
manufacturers they are supporting and

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,910
that set L is the center of Applied

00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:19,970
error nautical research located in

00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,670
Hamburg as well and we are working

00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,450
together with DLR on this project and

00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:29,780
the project is about safe integration of

00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:32,120
UAVs into an airspace so it's showing

00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,390
that an ears air traffic management

00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:38,450
sustain system is really capable to

00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:41,420
manage all those UAVs operated in in an

00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:44,420
urban air space we are connecting all

00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:47,300
the different services together that the

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,820
EU plans to implement with the u.s.

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,400
based concept in future and we are

00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:53,790
demonstrating in this project that it's

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,940
really working

00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,540
with the systems we have defined and

00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:06,240
developed during the project and the

00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:09,120
hardware we have setup for them there

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:12,750
was already the first demonstration done

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,940
in Hamburg it was a bridge inspection so

00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,110
we have a famous bridge over river up in

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:21,810
Hamburg it's the coal plant bridge and

00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:24,360
there were several drones used so free

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,780
drones from DLR two of them were

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:32,220
equipped with pixhawk FM use in fronting

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:35,690
px4 and also a flight path conflict

00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:39,390
scenario was part of the demonstration

00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:44,360
to showcase that this use space concept

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:46,950
and airspace Authority and resulting

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:49,380
information towards an deconfliction

00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:54,180
system does work so we were successful

00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:59,130
there there will be soon a video coming

00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:08,030
out published by DLR on this demo but I

00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:08,030
think it's not yet the air yes please

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:23,720
the DG are DGI drone was doing one task

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,740
we had three different flights in there

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:29,250
but I don't know exactly

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,550
niklas do you know maybe what the DJI

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:35,000
the the mantra is task force in the

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,000
project

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:31,120
yep so one was for navigation Sora was

00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:35,160
checked and also the conflict scenario

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,160
that that was in principle the answer

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,839
what was our contribution in the project

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,630
so we have provided hardware and

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,490
software for thrown a registration and a

00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:54,370
identification because the project is

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:57,730
aligning a bit with the steps in the U

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,990
space concept so u one is about strongly

00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,060
registration and you aren't

00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:03,040
identification and that we have

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,220
showcased in this project that we are

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:11,769
using an NFC tag and the purpose of the

00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:15,940
NFC tag was holding and pilot license or

00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:20,890
in insurance license initially allowing

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:26,560
the operator to register the drone at

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:28,690
the UTM drone registration service that

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,000
we have demonstrated successfully with

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:34,839
that together with LAN acts so we were

00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,390
using their registration system for that

00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:41,560
and then we used an secure element

00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:44,680
unique ID and the secure element secure

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:50,740
storage for holding the certificate that

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:55,959
was published by the system and also the

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,940
message was or the message is able to be

00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,339
signed we have defined an own message

00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:06,190
for that I will come to that on one of

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:08,889
the knot on one on this next slide the

00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:12,910
first thing we realized okay we need

00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:16,209
something to track of a hickey yeah and

00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,420
there needs to be a message that can be

00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:19,990
used by an airspace navigation service

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:25,400
provider

00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:28,400
Insp like German DLR for tracking drones

00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,430
and identifying trends within an UTM

00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:34,250
system the existing messages were not

00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:38,110
good enough so we have defined together

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:41,560
with DLR with a Tyrian and others and

00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:46,520
one serves all message you can call it

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:51,440
that supports identification of the V

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:54,500
key and possibility to do a deep

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,980
conflict deconfliction in advance so it

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:01,310
has the ID of the the behavior it has

00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:06,620
also the directory in so the next

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:10,010
Waypoint sent out 50 message and that is

00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:12,620
used then for tracking and deconfliction

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:16,610
and identification towards the UTM

00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:19,400
system what we have seen there is

00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:22,550
definitely our Renan dense is needed so

00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:25,070
you cannot rely only on one data link we

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:28,600
have used the multi link solution from

00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:33,590
cata graft as well as our d2x

00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:39,050
and we have seen a problem for example

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:40,970
with LTE in if you go out not in urban

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,350
if you're not in an urban space but

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:50,510
outside cities LTE LTE is using eight

00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:52,730
six eight megahertz yeah and the multi

00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,670
link solution was also using eight six

00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:59,060
eight megahertz for their RC remote

00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:02,090
control so we had seen then conflicts

00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,670
and interferences between the two

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:07,940
systems so that are things you're seeing

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:11,240
during such a trial so definitely you

00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:14,420
need Fred and antsy because there would

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:18,350
be occasions that you cannot foresee in

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:20,830
advance what we have also seen that air

00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,990
traffic control needs to have the data

00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:26,810
with very low latency because if you're

00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,780
flying at a certain speed and you have

00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:31,610
and separation criteria and I think we

00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:34,400
have set there twenty meters and the

00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:37,310
first warning at 70 meters or 50 meters

00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,360
roundabout there need to be very low

00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,519
latency so

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,279
need to have a transmission system that

00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:47,720
is able to provide the data very fast

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:51,079
towards the UTM system what we have also

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,820
seen that our 802 11 peak communication

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:56,089
I have it here and I will talk about

00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:00,500
this later was very reliable and we have

00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:05,149
just got an white paper on this

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:08,510
published on a trolley Explorer website

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:11,600
and the advantage you guys are having

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:15,110
here in being connected to the ETH

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,230
network ETH is having free access to I

00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,880
trouble a Explorer so you can download

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:22,339
it for free

00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,920
I've uploaded already the presentation

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,920
to chefs so if you open it there go to

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:32,209
slide number 8 you will find the link to

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,120
download the white paper on the 802 11 P

00:14:32,209 --> 00:14:38,329
communication it's a mesh network on 5.8

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,170
Giga and working very reliable thank you

00:14:38,329 --> 00:14:48,709
in I need to speed up cooperative

00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:52,730
awareness what I have said already it

00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:54,470
needs to include a mission and needs to

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:58,279
be incorporated in mission in a flight

00:14:54,470 --> 00:15:01,250
execution it doesn't work if you follow

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:03,440
your path then you another drone is

00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:08,089
crossing and you're smashing into that

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,870
so and therefore we have an change

00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:14,120
request currently running to incorporate

00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,449
the suitable position for collision

00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,029
avoidance and one hint to Laurence in

00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:22,160
the team please pick this up again

00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:31,010
because no one is working on that at the

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:32,290
moment yeah I know Laurence I didn't

00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,380
have your number

00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:39,070
design decision for the UTM killable

00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:41,390
position yeah redundancy needed

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,850
communication standard is needed that's

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:46,630
also important I'm personally involved

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:48,860
in to EUR ok working groups one is

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,580
identification the other one is

00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:57,160
geofencing so very defined the standards

00:15:51,580 --> 00:16:00,640
for the EU and I don't see anywhere

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:02,890
muffling being discussed so no one is

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:07,540
talking about muffling they talk about

00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:10,720
things like the airspace service

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,730
providers are using its protocol but no

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,590
bun incorporates nothing and I don't

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,770
like this so there needs to be more

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:20,680
effort from people pushing nothing

00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:24,160
towards a standard because it's very

00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,820
lightweight it serves the needs I would

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:35,410
say that we need to be getting the

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:39,820
standards cooperative awareness I

00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:42,700
mentioned already what happened

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,610
I'm going back that was the issue sorry

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,800
for that okay next one is the d2x

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,800
reference design because we have used

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,780
that there I have the hardware here so

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,930
that's that's our crown station we've

00:16:52,780 --> 00:17:00,370
used or one of the ground stations as

00:16:55,930 --> 00:17:03,040
stated before self-made housing you

00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:05,770
reusing other stuff so doesn't look that

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:08,709
nice but it's works the same board is

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:14,050
here on the throne in principle that's

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:18,070
and based on the vehicles Network safety

00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:22,690
Network 802 11 P from automotive

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:26,320
industry IPS g5 is the protocol usually

00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:28,270
run on this device we have made here and

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,880
custom implementation for the drones

00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:36,720
because we need to have something 2

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:40,210
minutes left and I'm behind schedule and

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,810
it's we think it perfectly fits for

00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:47,110
drone operation as well because the

00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:48,940
requirements for cars were high

00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:53,050
approaching speed so it's designed for

00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:55,630
up to 500 kilometer spare or very low

00:17:53,050 --> 00:18:00,100
latency it's below 1 millisecond we have

00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:04,880
seen a very reliable data link up to 27

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,040
M bits data rate and capabilities work

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,080
with reflections if you are operating in

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,260
urban air space you have a lot of

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:16,100
reflections where normal Wi-Fi usually

00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:18,440
gives up that's a problem there so we

00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:23,510
have successfully tested this in the

00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:28,120
project and with DLR and we like to move

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:28,120
with that forward towards drone industry

00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:34,820
secure element it's also something we

00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:38,690
have used in this project secure element

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,940
is a hardware root of trust while we can

00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,790
say this because also the supply chain

00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:45,140
for building the device is secured there

00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:47,750
are certain standards you need to

00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:51,500
fulfill to build an Hardware secure

00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:53,830
element we are certified doing this you

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:56,210
need to have secure storage secure

00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:59,930
production environment all those kind of

00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:03,470
things a secure element provides a

00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:06,920
secure storage provides crypto traffic

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:10,370
all processes elliptic curve based years

00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,860
all setup can be done encryption alt

00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:16,940
indication of in-house process so we use

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:19,940
it here for the authentication we use it

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:22,670
on our ESC I will come to that on the

00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:25,520
next slide for example for secure boot

00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:29,270
up because we have made an ELC reference

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,210
design where we like to run third party

00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:35,870
software on beside proprietary software

00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:39,370
from the original designer so all those

00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:43,130
things can be done with a secure element

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:49,670
sorry I need to go fast now otherwise

00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:51,530
you will hit me there you see that's for

00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,690
us the reference design we have picked

00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:57,140
fly do we know why fly do we know they

00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,260
are designing LCS and flight controls

00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:03,140
for drone racing since 2000 so they are

00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,330
very experienced in that it's a small

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:08,410
company and they are sitting in Hamburg

00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:13,940
so for me it was easy to approach them

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:17,060
what we have done and drone ESC based on

00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,800
automotive grade hardware so automotive

00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:22,160
safety certified

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:27,170
I see we are using their so they as 42

00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:29,710
okay we have a system bassist chip with

00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:32,540
Fred and and power supply on their

00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,840
Dupree Travis also automotive-grade

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:38,300
that's the main ICS on that and it flies

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:41,240
so that's a picture from the first test

00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:44,480
flight I've done that's the test where

00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:48,170
he to here it's looking at he but it

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,059
flies and I will do for the test

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:54,230
tomorrow because tomorrow I'm at the

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:57,070
developer of the ESC Felix Neeson who is

00:20:54,230 --> 00:21:01,970
by the way also the inventor of tee shot

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:05,600
so very known well-known in this domain

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:08,690
and he's just working on porting UA we

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,100
can to this device so might be of

00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,100
interest for you guys as well

00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:21,140
that's the block diagram so system basis

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:24,670
chip as 42 K automotive create MC okay

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:28,880
Travis 83,000 and the secure element as

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:31,100
stated there this cue element can be

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,610
used for secure boot up so that you make

00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:36,800
sure that your software which is in

00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,340
principle the main IP because the

00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,020
hardware design is not that complicated

00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:44,179
the software is the main IP can be

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,970
protected because in the software you

00:21:44,179 --> 00:21:50,570
can implement during pew put up its

00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:52,970
checks with the secure element if the

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:54,920
right certificate is there so that it is

00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:58,340
really running on the hardware where

00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:02,900
should their children that's easily

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:05,360
possible if that ultra-wideband not used

00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:08,630
in the project yet but will be used for

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:11,660
sure what is ultra wideband ultra

00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:16,460
wideband is the technology running on we

00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:19,580
use it on 6.5 Giga which uses the RF

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:23,120
signal time-of-flight to precisely do

00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:25,340
distance measurements that's a picture

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,250
from a test I have done recently with

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:30,770
one of our students working on his

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:32,180
master thesis on ultraviolent in curing

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:34,880
his master thesis

00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:39,980
he will design a custom board with drone

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:43,370
code connector standard and a system we

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,940
can use as a reference design for drone

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:49,220
precision takeoff and landing so

00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:53,720
performance data as you see here on the

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:57,710
screen we reached a reliable one nearly

00:22:53,720 --> 00:23:02,180
over 100 meter we can have plus minus 5

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:05,990
centimeter accuracy and we will do their

00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:09,470
onboard as state that together with out

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:12,020
here on px for doing then also the

00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:15,620
software integration and having already

00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:20,050
designed for demonstrating that it is

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,050
capable to provide the performance

00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:27,950
that's the block diagram as you see we

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:33,950
have several the back connectors we have

00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:36,110
Huard we have a square C SPI we don't

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,940
have because we use it for the

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:40,430
communication to the Ranger system but

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:45,130
we also have 10 can and we will put here

00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:49,400
we can on this as well on a later stage

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:55,720
but maybe also internet internet if if

00:23:49,400 --> 00:24:01,340
needed a spinoff of this and that was

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:02,870
Ian pushing me doing we thought okay we

00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:07,070
are doing a small board for the

00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:09,800
ultraviolent it serves our need there we

00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:11,660
make already all the connectivities that

00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,910
could be used for something else as well

00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:15,440
why not making a small adapter board and

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,590
that's what we are working in parallel

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:22,550
on it's a small adapter port for UAV can

00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:25,190
so it will provide your task for C SPI

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:30,110
it will have a secure element as well

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:33,410
and for you if we can or for can we used

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:35,470
a chess dgh connector standard for

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:42,259
everything else it will be solder pads

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:47,029
to be more flexible for you guys the

00:24:42,259 --> 00:24:50,690
should it have one can port or does it

00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:55,059
need to have two that's something two

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,059
votes for two okay we'll make sure

00:24:55,240 --> 00:25:00,889
that's it all right I'm gonna sorry for

00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,419
yogurt I mean okay I'm gonna go very

00:25:00,889 --> 00:25:06,470
fast we're okay

00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:09,320
first okay all right when we started

00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:10,879
into looking into drones as a company we

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,379
said oh this is sort of what we end up

00:25:10,879 --> 00:25:14,059
needing you this is the kind of block

00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:15,710
diagram we ended up with and we realized

00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:18,350
how complicated it was and that's one of

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,789
the reasons we really joined drone code

00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,340
and want to be involved with the px4

00:25:19,789 --> 00:25:23,779
project because it it it's the only way

00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:26,659
we could address this kind of complexity

00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:27,529
with such a small team and take

00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,330
advantage of the software that's

00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,070
available so we really wanted to get our

00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,500
foot in the water and start with a

00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,870
flight management unit we thought we had

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:38,029
to have some some real experience under

00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:39,340
their belt and so we built the first our

00:25:38,029 --> 00:25:41,690
first flight management unit and

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:45,409
eventually built this hover game's drone

00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:47,149
development kit and it is a complete kit

00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:50,120
that we provide which includes the

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:52,370
telemetry with GPS it's ready to build

00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:54,200
it's not a drone it's a drone

00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:57,649
development kit it ships with zero

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,870
software and it bug or so you program it

00:25:57,649 --> 00:26:02,059
yourself it's based on a kinetise

00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,129
microcontroller one of our mic arm m4

00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:07,070
microcontrollers I wouldn't say it's

00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:09,799
it's not state-of-the-art but it's an FM

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,440
u v4 compatible type of flight

00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:16,759
controller it does ship oh is that going

00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,440
automatically okay the and it has all

00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:20,360
the standard interfaces you'd like to

00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,879
see the important thing is it's a

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:25,129
one-stop shop for a development tool be

00:26:22,879 --> 00:26:29,330
great for universities or people wanting

00:26:25,129 --> 00:26:30,980
to learn about drone development it does

00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:33,379
it's quite complete it has a remote

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,169
control in the telemetry and a debugger

00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:38,419
you know stickers and wrench keys hex

00:26:36,169 --> 00:26:42,049
wrench keys yeah there we go the normal

00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:43,820
drone code connectors and the two

00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:45,799
highlights I guess I'd say where we

00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,720
differentiate ourselves is it has a TJ a

00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:49,700
1100 which is a two hour automotive

00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,039
ethernet part so it's an unshielded

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,399
twisted-pair and then the secure element

00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,409
that Gerald mentioned earlier we

00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:59,749
you included a variety of sensors on

00:26:57,409 --> 00:27:02,029
board more than just ours

00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:06,649
and we had some great feedback already

00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:08,089
on the ethernet and then learning over

00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:09,259
time we're working with soap and source

00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:10,849
community that you know we're really

00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:13,190
interested in getting moving us up to

00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:15,649
can FD type of interface that's a block

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,509
diagram I'll just skip through these

00:27:15,649 --> 00:27:19,249
slides are all posted I did want to

00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:21,849
mention one of the advantages of to our

00:27:19,249 --> 00:27:25,489
Ethernet is you know it's it's got its

00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:28,669
magnetic wire any magnetics so a little

00:27:25,489 --> 00:27:31,820
bit less weight and it's quite simple to

00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:33,619
implement and it's still Ethernet over

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,210
the bus just in a different form factor

00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:38,419
so it's quite not you can go about 15

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:39,950
meters maximum we also had another

00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:42,440
project internal to the company called

00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:45,849
an IOT development board rapid IOT and I

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:49,099
thought hey why don't we take that and

00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:50,719
it'd have an interface board over to the

00:27:49,099 --> 00:27:53,629
drone in an ecosystem I think we have

00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:55,429
slides I think so okay the interesting

00:27:53,629 --> 00:27:57,609
thing here is it's a mic another my

00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:00,889
controller it's got some radios built-in

00:27:57,609 --> 00:28:03,049
sensors and 802 15.4 radio so yesterday

00:28:00,889 --> 00:28:05,149
provel was talking about maybe UAV can

00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:06,799
will run over an 802 15.4 radio in the

00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:09,979
future and you could start prototyping

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,269
on this tomorrow it's basically a board

00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:13,460
the big thing is it's got these little

00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:15,440
click modules so from an IOT perspective

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,729
you can pick up any month one of four

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,830
hundred different boards and plug in

00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:22,580
Laura or a gas sensor or an ultraviolet

00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:24,799
sensor and now you have mobile IOT and

00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,309
out of this we decided we've got this

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,710
drone so let's make a challenge and we

00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:32,269
started hover games challenge so it's it

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,389
meant to be an ongoing coding

00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:37,789
competition with prize prizes we're

00:28:35,389 --> 00:28:40,159
using it to bring more people into the

00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:42,679
px4 open source community bringing

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,570
University students and into into it as

00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,879
well but also engineers and programmers

00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:49,580
our customers tend to be you know

00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:52,219
whirlpool and General Motors and and

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,619
medical companies that are surprisingly

00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:56,869
interested in drones as far as I know

00:28:54,619 --> 00:28:59,929
every car company has a drone program

00:28:56,869 --> 00:29:01,030
and they don't talk about it it's a

00:28:59,929 --> 00:29:03,540
complete kit it has

00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:06,400
[Laughter]

00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:08,410
this has complete kid it has get book

00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:13,840
documentation we followed all the same

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:15,160
patterns that uh that px4 it is so and

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,530
our first challenge is called fight

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,300
fires with flyers so we'd invite anyone

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:21,340
that wants to join conjoin but also to

00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:24,190
mention it to friends and family and

00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:30,220
colleagues or university students it's

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:33,790
not so the ideas it's a very broad broad

00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:35,170
swath here like help fire help

00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,120
firefighters in any way you can see

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,370
possible with drones while using the

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,309
underlying technology we include the

00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:44,410
rapid IOT and the in people that applaud

00:29:42,309 --> 00:29:46,240
for people that apply a Pixy cam which

00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,800
is a very simple camera and a heat

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,640
sensor so it's kind of representative

00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:54,340
it's not really commercial level when

00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:56,770
you apply the people that apply in our

00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:59,890
chosen get a discounted all this for

00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:03,130
three hundred dollars now assuming

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:05,550
you're not going to join we did want to

00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:07,840
offer an offer here for px for

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:10,240
developers so this if you want to take a

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,770
picture you can use this discount code

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,490
if you feel like picking up one of these

00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:16,870
drones with the two discounts the radio

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:18,790
telemetry radios ordered separately

00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:22,960
depending on which region yura and if

00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:27,910
it's oh sorry if it's a for 13 or 915 am

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:31,030
I done in time are we okay alright I'll

00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:33,010
leave it there I I'll have one more

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,860
slide if that's okay but I like to

00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,500
mention something we launched it

00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,679
internally before we launched its public

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,470
and we had great success internally so

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,720
we have thought about yeah ten teams and

00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,179
we will give away 10 drones internally

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,059
at the end we have more than 100 people

00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:55,000
from annex B internally and 50 teams

00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:58,270
worldwide working on this drone so we

00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,929
hope that we as nxp can contribute in

00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:06,250
future lots in today px4 ecosystem with

00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:08,530
new code and new hardware support so we

00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:11,200
continue to build more reference designs

00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:14,230
more pieces for that'll the 50px for

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,790
ecosystem as a continuation hover games

00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,070
is not one challenge it goes

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:19,990
and on our next challenge will include

00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,520
this new reference module for a battery

00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:25,480
management system the slides are

00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,530
published but it is a battery manager a

00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:28,240
management smart battery management

00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:32,470
system using all automotive grade

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,730
components and could potentially get it

00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,100
to the next level where we have battery

00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,860
health monitoring not just battery state

00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,300
of charge and the prototype board looks

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,040
like this and we'll try to do something

00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:45,370
to make it available widely for

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:48,670
developers so we'll we'll stop there and

00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:51,100
please come and see us if happy to

00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:53,690
answer any questions and move on from

00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:58,359
there thanks thank you guys

00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:58,359
[Applause]
