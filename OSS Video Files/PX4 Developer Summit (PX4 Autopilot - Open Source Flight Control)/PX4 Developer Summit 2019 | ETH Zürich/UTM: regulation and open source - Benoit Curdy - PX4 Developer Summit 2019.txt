Innovation & Digitalization, Federal Office of Civil Aviation FOCA

The Swiss Federal Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) supports the development of an open and interoperable UTM concept. The architecture includes an open source project as one of its key component for strategic deconfliction. FOCA is interested to present its UTM architecture and to engage with the community to further explore how to integrate open source in its development.

all right so thank you already hold it

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,890
up how are you after those two days all

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:25,020
good all right that's the spirit I love

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:29,160
that all right so I'm extremely thankful

00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,630
to be here and extremely excited I only

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,669
been able to attend today but it's

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,920
energizing it's good it's great to see

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:38,460
the community it's good to see you

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,020
people you are the doers and well

00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,410
obviously in my position now

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,480
representing government so we're doing

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,370
stuff right we're doing some stuff I

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,380
were doing regulation mostly but it's

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,780
definitely not at the same level so I

00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,050
just wanted to start with a little

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,840
change of scene and to give you how we

00:00:55,050 --> 00:01:00,270
think as a government then I'll move

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,000
into UTM that that's my main job so I

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,850
joined Foca to be working on undrawn

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,380
integration safe secure efficient and

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,500
what it means so we'll spend a little

00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,110
bit of time on that and then I have a

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,420
big question then I have something that

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:19,130
I want us to think about together is how

00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:21,960
can we change the way we think about

00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:24,659
making things fly Aviation has been

00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,600
doing a lot of quite work for many many

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,580
years but still we need to change we

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,010
need to improve we need to be faster and

00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,590
I need your help I don't have the

00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:39,240
answers so I'm really here you know with

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,830
a big question mark so I know when we

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,360
think of a government and in particular

00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,479
when we think about civil aviation

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,790
authorities we we tend to think safety

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,729
safety safety or you can do that you

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,830
know it's not safe it's not secure we

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:55,530
spend a lot of time thinking about

00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,780
safety and security that is true we also

00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:01,140
spend a lot of time thinking about how

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,100
can we make you all participate to this

00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:08,189
news to this new era of aviation in you

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,590
know a fair way and it's not easy and

00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:13,379
and the reason I put this slide here is

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:16,440
because we don't always understand the

00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,239
the consequences of what we do you know

00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,330
sometimes you have good intentions and

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,920
they end up being well the end result is

00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,910
what you wanted when your government

00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:29,340
this can have very very bad consequences

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,360
so we spend a lot of time thinking if we

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,250
go that way

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,400
will everybody be able to participate

00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,190
who is excluded what's the impact so

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,470
when you talk to us keep that in mind

00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,650
we're not only obsessed about safety and

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:46,740
security we're also very careful to make

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:49,860
sure that we're not excluding anyone so

00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,960
there are other ways of looking at it so

00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:54,330
market power is to say well you know I'm

00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:56,610
going here and this is my ID and then

00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,190
you know it's a patentee to death and

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,959
nobody can come and obviously then you

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,110
have your monopoly this is a big no go

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,970
we don't want to hear that we're very

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:09,240
adverse to that externality is stuff

00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:12,000
like well actually I spend a lot of time

00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,650
developing something but then there's no

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,180
way I can protect it and everybody is

00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,110
going to steal it you you mentioned it

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,209
before we're also very sensitive to that

00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:23,520
stuff like information asymmetry this is

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:25,290
when suddenly you have part of the

00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,030
market that is very well informed like

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:29,100
let's say US government

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,570
I decided only talk to you and nobody

00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,330
else and so you know everything

00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:35,760
everybody else doesn't this is not good

00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:38,670
so we're also really trying to make sure

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,320
everybody has the same understanding of

00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,600
the situation so you have an you know

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,140
fair chances to accept to to access the

00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,110
market and capability failure is perhaps

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,060
the worst is when individual companies

00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,370
another group of people don't have the

00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,860
necessary knowledge to achieve a goal

00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,920
but when you put them all together they

00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,420
suddenly have that capacity and and so

00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,550
as the government what you want to do is

00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,370
bring everybody together so suddenly you

00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,860
get to that level where things that you

00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,630
want can happen and I don't know if you

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,300
get that feeling but when I look at this

00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,760
list it's pretty much open source right

00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,070
it's pretty much what you are doing you

00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:18,959
are making sure that everybody has a

00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:20,790
fair access you are making sure that

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,320
everybody has a fair understanding you

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,380
are making sure that everybody can act

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,560
upon things so that's why I'm really

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,780
thinking we there's something we have to

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,760
do together there's a new way of doing

00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,100
things because the way we do things at

00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,840
this stage is to work and

00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,000
and herbs for instance so this is

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:44,220
something I know is refered you refer to

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,710
at least and the Explorer community this

00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,330
is an industry standard and for us an

00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,210
industry standard is perfect we don't

00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,100
have to do anything it is among you you

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:56,460
know you do your staff you agree it's

00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:59,310
beautiful no problem and it's usually

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,090
pretty powerful you then have things

00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:07,680
like that who among you is using this

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:12,780
kind of document anyone how much you

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,940
love it zero to ten you can stop at you

00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,600
know you can even put between zero and

00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,550
one these are called acceptable means of

00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,310
compliance it's those are not standard

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,620
spaces you know Quality Assurance level

00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:28,430
and stuff like that extremely powerful

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,410
extremely useful extremely painful but

00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:35,400
you know these are why we're all so

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,890
happy to go in in the plane so it's

00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:39,600
pretty good but it's pretty tough and

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,180
then you have the regulatory standards

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,320
do you know these signs everybody is

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:48,420
familiar with those easy marking so

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,370
pretty much all the drones that you'll

00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,620
have in the European market will have to

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,300
get one of those it will tell you

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,190
exactly you know how many volts you can

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,830
have in your batteries it will tell you

00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,470
exactly what you do how you do start it

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,690
tells you exactly which precise tender

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,090
you must use in order to access the

00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:09,900
European market the good thing is that

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:12,150
it is self declared so you nobody's

00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:14,970
going to come knock at the door and say

00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:17,880
prove me that you have used this NSI CTA

00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:20,190
standard but if we catch you not doing

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,780
it then it's tough then you don't have

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,410
access to the European market anymore

00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:29,100
and you know that's what happens it's

00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:31,860
it's bad regulating standards as a last

00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,290
thing but it's really very detailed very

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,300
tough but in the same time easy right

00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,520
for you it's much better than you know

00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,460
the standard you go there it's two pages

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,030
it cuts 70 it costs 70 bucks for two

00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,310
pages doesn't matter once you have it

00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,840
it's fine you know I put the little

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,449
snail here because

00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:52,680
that's the issue this is a string I

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:56,490
don't know how many characters it has

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:59,970
maybe 10 maybe 12 right it takes two

00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,919
years to develop so realize that we need

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,169
two years industry in governments to

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,479
agree and a string of 12 characters

00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:12,060
imagine when we get into other

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,400
developments it's it's much worse so

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,650
this is one thing so this is to give you

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,229
a little bit about how we think about

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:22,290
the world and what we do and what kind

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,690
of tools we want to have now my job

00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,240
actually is pretty specific at the

00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:30,180
moment so we don't see innovation only

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,860
as UTM but you tell me is a big part of

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,250
it at the moment is integrating drones

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,860
in the air space and the reason I say

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:41,090
UTM does not exist I'll give you a

00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:45,479
definition later but it's here yet it's

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:47,580
because actually we're not talking about

00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,449
a service that we're going to switch on

00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:53,760
one day and switch off if we happy UTM

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:56,520
the way we look at it is exactly like

00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,789
the Internet right it's it's a series of

00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,620
protocols it's a cereal layer of

00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:03,660
hardware and software that you put

00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,190
together and at the end of the day it's

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,370
a distributed system you don't really

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:10,560
have any control over it and this is

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,110
this is good and this is the way we want

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,410
it so when we think about integrating

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:20,010
drones in the civil airspace we are not

00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:23,700
aiming at having that massive ATM right

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:25,979
so ATM is a traffic management like

00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:28,139
system where we have a few people in a

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:29,789
room who are going to tell you you fly

00:08:28,139 --> 00:08:31,349
here and you don't find here you stop

00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:33,240
you gotta this is not going to happen

00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:35,729
this is not a vision at all we're

00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,979
talking about distributed systems that

00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:42,659
you will have access to and you will be

00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:45,180
able to develop individually this is our

00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:48,540
current collapse concept of operation

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,140
and you will see here a lot of familiar

00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,600
names you know we talked yesterday about

00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:59,000
the gun control stations a lot about the

00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:01,260
different things at this stage we have

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,400
three things in Europe that are kind of

00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,240
ready standard

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:09,390
I stand ready to be pushed up to 20 21

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,490
is registration so soon all drone users

00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:14,100
will have to get registered unless you

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:17,760
fly your toy a toy is defined pretty

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:19,200
much as any drone below 250 grams once

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,550
you're above that you will get

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:27,450
registered remote identification is also

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:31,560
coming and in that sense expect to see

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:34,740
two line broadcast identification you

00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,230
just say hey Who am I to the world

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,720
whoever listens we're also thinking

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:42,920
about network identification where you

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,040
you provide a full picture through your

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,260
service providers and the last thing is

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,540
your fencing so those are the very basic

00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,460
simple building blocks that we kind of

00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,680
have already it's not a big it's not a

00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:59,130
big issue we are now looking into the

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,900
next chapter the next evolution and this

00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:05,310
is pretty much what we have in the

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:08,460
middle so us P stands for UAS service

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:11,490
provider any company providing service

00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,800
that gives you access to their space and

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,990
here you have a lot of stuff so actually

00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,060
not all of that is going to be mandatory

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:21,240
you know it's it's just a list of

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:23,430
services that you could have and again

00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,700
you find out you know the weather flight

00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:30,800
planning logbooks I mean you're probably

00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:33,990
familiar with a lot of that and on the

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:36,390
left side you have something called the

00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,100
themes this is all you can think of it

00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:40,620
and I'm simplifying a little bit but

00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:44,310
think of it as your connection to man

00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:47,370
daddy ation so here you get aeronautical

00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,650
data you get information about where the

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,900
airports are and and what happens if you

00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:55,860
want to fly the how do you ask people a

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:57,840
few rules and stuff like that and below

00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:59,160
you have the authority USP and this is

00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,380
more you know what happens when the

00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,210
military you want to access the system

00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:05,520
what happens when the police wants to do

00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,920
something and so we need a way for the

00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,950
authorities to be linked to that so they

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,840
can say you know oh we are here the the

00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:14,180
police we need to do an intubation

00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:17,240
somewhere and

00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,540
please leave us fly there and this is

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,440
will be done independently so as you can

00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,790
see it is it is a pretty dense ecosystem

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,100
and that's why we want it to be

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,050
distributed because this is the only way

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,300
you make it happen you can't decide that

00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:36,850
this has to happen tomorrow on any given

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:38,870
date but the big thing here is

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,760
strategically confliction and if we

00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:46,010
quickly go back here this inter USP

00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:48,200
bubble at the bottom that's strategy

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,350
deconfliction so strategic deconfliction

00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:53,899
is your flight planning where am i going

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,120
to be tomorrow between 2:00 and 3:00 and

00:11:53,899 --> 00:12:00,440
this is what I want to fly so you're

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:04,640
telling the world your intention so it's

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,089
a good thing but you need to understand

00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,290
that it's not centralized so how do you

00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,510
broadcast it and who do you what that is

00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,580
- if it's not centralized well as you

00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:17,060
well know there are many ways to create

00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:19,010
distributed systems the way we are

00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,680
looking at at the moment and that's why

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,610
we're getting into open source is to use

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:30,320
this entire USS platform and actually

00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:33,140
each u.s. service provider would have to

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,860
run an instance of the entire US

00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:39,260
intelligence platform that would allow

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,020
them to then communicate with the others

00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:44,450
sheriff I planning and have a

00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,570
situational awareness where is everybody

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:50,959
the beauty of it is that we want to make

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,150
sure that data privacy is is there so

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,790
how we achieve that you will only get

00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:58,250
access to other people's information if

00:12:55,790 --> 00:13:01,940
you are active in an area so we're using

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:05,510
a gridded system and you say okay I am

00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,850
here in that grid and I'm flying today

00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,650
who else is there and only people who

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,899
are also on that grid will share

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:14,600
information with you and so you don't

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:17,180
have everybody knowing about knowing

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,770
about everybody else and this is kind of

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,670
the key principles how do we protect

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:25,520
privacy while maximizing the information

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:28,120
sharing and if you want to abuse the

00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,160
system well it's pretty simple we

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,800
move you to the list of people who can

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,120
run an interview assess platform and so

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,500
you don't have access to all others and

00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,510
basically you out of the system so we

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:39,580
have a pretty good incentive to make

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:41,920
sure everybody is honest and it's not

00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:44,589
spamming and it's not spying right so

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,980
this is the kind of options that we're

00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:52,660
exploring and it's pretty new I mean

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:54,640
there's no maybe in other areas this has

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,070
been done but in my experience in

00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,770
aviation having something like that

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:04,540
decentralized pace and open-source is

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:07,180
really really new basically what it does

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:09,610
is a simple mechanism what I just said

00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,950
is discovery who else is there whilst I

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:14,650
talk to and synchronization making sure

00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:16,390
all data are synchronized and the beauty

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:18,400
of it is that you can use it for those

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:21,730
services right he wished we said all

00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:25,170
let's share flight hands but then you

00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:28,870
can say oh let's share remote ideas who

00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:30,550
from my participants are where and then

00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:32,470
suddenly you also do the same discovery

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,540
synchronization and you can keep going

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,630
like that and it's it's really

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,660
interesting so what we do again as

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,820
Authority is just that saying you can

00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,500
participate you cannot participate

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:48,010
because you don't meet certain

00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:50,260
requirements and then if you meet them

00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:53,080
the goal the idea would be that you can

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,540
participate so the idea would be to get

00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,640
as close as possible to making sure you

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,350
meet technical requirements because

00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,089
nowadays if you want to become an air

00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,120
navigation service providers you know

00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:08,170
it's it's pretty tough there are people

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:10,750
coming on-site inspecting your where you

00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:12,760
work how you work how you train at what

00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,430
time in the morning you you coming there

00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:18,130
and you know I think this is great for a

00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:20,620
traditional ideation but we need to to

00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:24,100
change that mindset if we want to move

00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,620
into the world of drones and that's why

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:29,140
I need you that's where I need to

00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:31,930
understand how are we moving how are we

00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:35,860
working together to get there so

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:38,020
industry standards again easy acceptable

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:39,550
means of compliance I think we'll find

00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,540
ways we're always find ways of making

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,640
working we understand that

00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,640
but is there way how do we integrate

00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:50,910
into regulation something like inter USS

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:53,360
I'm not sure we we know exactly how to

00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:55,980
do it and I don't think that any

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,890
decisions like that you know should be

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,630
taken without having you in the loop

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:02,490
you know developers making sure that we

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:05,040
really go with the people developing

00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:06,930
making sure that were very close from

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,440
action actually and that's why I'm here

00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:11,040
today

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,930
so that that's the ID and that could be

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:17,610
other ways that could be other areas

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:20,100
that are up for open-source and where we

00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:21,800
could point to and I think Lawrence this

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,900
morning had a pretty good you know

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,460
sentence about we want to make sure that

00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:29,430
whatever we do it's not at the

00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:31,500
competition level so please complete

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,080
that is our goal our goal is to provide

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:36,090
a framework where you compete but our

00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,790
goal is also to make sure that wherever

00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:41,010
there's no competition because it

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,080
doesn't make sense to compete then we

00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:45,660
provide a framework that is open that is

00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,280
flexible and so forth and here again

00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,350
that's why I need your help so if you if

00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,260
you have ideas if you see things if you

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,170
heard about how this has been done in

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,940
other industries you know please contact

00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,370
me come back to me I think we have

00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,010
general information in the in the in the

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:05,210
schedule and be very interested to hear

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,210
from you that's it

00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,829
[Applause]
