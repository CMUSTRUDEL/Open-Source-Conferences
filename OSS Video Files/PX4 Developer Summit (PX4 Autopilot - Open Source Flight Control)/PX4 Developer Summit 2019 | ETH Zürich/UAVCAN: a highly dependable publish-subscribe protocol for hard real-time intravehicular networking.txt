UAVCAN is a compact and robust protocol designed to provide publish/subscribe and remote procedure call (RPC) transports on top of real-time, reliable, and redundant networks for highly-deterministic applications. It is a modern protocol focused on cyber-physical systems making it relevant to the emerging class of vehicles that are largely software-defined and increasingly autonomous. Being first proposed in 2014, the protocol has been integrated into numerous systems and is supported by several vendors worldwide. Experience from years of real-world integration and deployment has culminated in the first long-term stable version – UAVCAN v1.0. New features in this version include compatibility with transport protocols such as CAN FD and UDP/Ethernet, DSDL message versioning, a simplified on-wire representation of UAVCAN frames, and a clear process for the registration and deconfliction of message identifiers between systems and vendors.
