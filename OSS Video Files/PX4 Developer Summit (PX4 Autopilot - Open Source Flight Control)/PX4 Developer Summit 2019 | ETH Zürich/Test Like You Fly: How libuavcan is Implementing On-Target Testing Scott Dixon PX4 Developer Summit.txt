Publication date: 2019-07-03
Playlist: PX4 Developer Summit 2019 | ETH Zürich
Description: 
	Scott Dixon
Software Engineer, Amazon
I'm a firmware engineer with Amazon PrimeAir in Seattle and a passionate maker of things.

In this talk, we will demonstrate how the libuavcan project, a C++ implementation of the UAVCAN protocol, is using Raspberry PIs and Buildkite.com to run unit tests on Cortex-M targets as part of its automated build pipeline. We’ll discuss why we’re investing in this capability, how the project’s methodology is well suited for geographically distributed teams developing firmware and will invite others in the PX4 community to comment and contribute ideas on how to evolve and improve what we’ve built.

This is a presentation of a blog post I have on my personal site here.
