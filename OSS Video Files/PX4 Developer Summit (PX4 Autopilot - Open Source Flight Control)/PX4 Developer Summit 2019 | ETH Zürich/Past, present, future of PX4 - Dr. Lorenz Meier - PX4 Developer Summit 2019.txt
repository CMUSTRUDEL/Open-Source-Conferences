perfect so this is really really special

00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:22,270
to me it's special because we thought

00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:24,699
we're organized meeting for you know

00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:27,789
three thirty forty guys who are

00:00:24,699 --> 00:00:30,369
interested and now we have over two

00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:33,520
hundred people which is amazing because

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:36,789
this is a very very deep tech summit

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,379
it's not something that is you know for

00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:42,030
business development or anything like

00:00:38,379 --> 00:00:45,100
that which will so happen but we have

00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:49,810
the best brains in the world today here

00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,320
on this and that is indeed super

00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,320
exciting

00:00:54,880 --> 00:01:12,549
[Music]

00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:15,200
what do you need to watch our so yeah

00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:19,549
usually this is without audio but thanks

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,470
to HDMI we have this all on perfect so

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:24,590
what you need to watch is like the

00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:46,159
interest that these animals have in

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:48,500
drones and good and yeah we're a lot of

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,750
people here so I hope you use the

00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,819
opportunity to mingle I hope you use the

00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:54,819
opportunity to speak to other developers

00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:01,670
ramon has also already introduced myself

00:01:58,909 --> 00:02:03,920
I think I I'm not going to spend a lot

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,799
of time on this but for me it's really

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,420
special that over ten years after

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,970
creating a number of open-source

00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,390
projects that together form a software

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,519
stack for a drone we're back here with a

00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:21,319
large international development

00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:22,040
community back at ETH where this all

00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,359
started

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:29,180
and given that ETH is hosting us I also

00:02:26,359 --> 00:02:32,299
wanted to do a bit of introduction like

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:34,700
one slide there's one very famous

00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:39,470
student of ETH Zurich in case you didn't

00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:43,010
know along with more than 20 Nobel other

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:47,480
Nobel laureates so it has a long history

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:55,010
and it has a lot of drone projects and

00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:57,019
drone research going on now if you

00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:59,359
haven't done that yet feel free to take

00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:05,180
a picture like this is the perfect title

00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:07,400
slide for your social media and and

00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:10,040
share it because I think we're doing a

00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:14,480
lot of great work but we're not talking

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,549
enough about it and I believe that this

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,500
is beneficial to everybody in this room

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:20,690
to make sure there's a bit more

00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,290
awareness in particular with adopters

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,930
and

00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:34,400
with your manager or your customers it's

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:35,810
a thing and then of course I'm going to

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:43,269
do the same thing and this slide is just

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:43,269
to illuminate the room a little more so

00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:52,599
perfect and since it's 2019 and it's the

00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,599
age of the influencer

00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:07,569
wonderful and and in terms of influencer

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,410
I think that is also like I was

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:14,800
struggling for a decade how to explain

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,720
what you are right sometimes corporate

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,910
folks things like yeah you know these

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,780
are the geniuses and they deserve

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:26,380
respect and all of that that's true but

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,540
that's not enough the people in the

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:30,790
development community are technical

00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,880
geniuses but they are on top of that

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,010
influencers because what happens is that

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,940
your work ends up in many different

00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:42,730
places and because it's so good content

00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,180
it actually influences whole

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:48,250
organizations and industries and I think

00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:51,390
that's the best way to think about open

00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,250
source it's grassroots it's democratized

00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:56,890
engineering the same way as social media

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:59,980
influencers have to some degree for

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:03,070
better or worse Democrat eyes social

00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:07,060
media and and the media in general and

00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:11,110
so I think that's really powerful so

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,850
let's use that I will also want to show

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,800
a little bit of history because we have

00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,780
awesome content through the next two

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,820
days and I don't want to sort of take

00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:21,070
that content away from people as they're

00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:26,470
introducing it so I'm not going to go

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:27,430
very deep but I just wanted to show it's

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,830
a long journey

00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,220
it's a journey that's early 2008 here

00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:38,710
and that went through many different

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:43,750
stages of a whole technology stack so

00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:46,479
nine years ago we did this you can see

00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,830
ETH logo the old Pixar clos go that's

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,940
when you start to see that stuff is

00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:56,979
really old and who recognizes this

00:05:51,940 --> 00:06:01,260
application yeah you see that's cue gun

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,260
control 9 years ago

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,380
unbelievable

00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:13,310
unbelievable and it's still here so this

00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:14,810
is a the simulation log replay here you

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,380
have this weird thing where it can

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:25,030
control multiple drones amazing complete

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:28,100
the usability from hell but that's what

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:33,050
the start was ten years ago you already

00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:38,330
could take off a vehicle yeah it's it's

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:40,850
quite it's quite gross but it's actually

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,650
interesting to see so I think the

00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,840
evolution over nine years is actually a

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:48,050
long way at the same time when I look

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,420
back it's not so fundamentally different

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,280
that nine years ago I would have

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,220
expected that we actually get a little

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:58,150
further in this whole industry seems

00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:59,870
such a long time now eight years ago

00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:08,890
what did we get

00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:13,210
well not our ETH video same old logo and

00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:16,700
that is indoor GPS denied navigation

00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:21,920
solved in hardware I mean you can

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:23,810
clearly see it but it's actually pretty

00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,760
cool because eight years ago we were

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:29,540
already able to fly completely

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:31,880
autonomously a mission indoors and yes

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:35,750
indoor navigation as a sensory system

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:40,850
hasn't been solved but it clearly did

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:45,110
work by throwing a lot of logistics at

00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:50,030
the problem so again to me in a way

00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:52,820
hilarious in another way well that was

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,910
almost a decade ago and we're still not

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,620
doing this like all the time everywhere

00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:00,500
there's not an indoor localization

00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:03,050
system that's in every building you

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,270
still needed to find your way into this

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:10,730
lecture room without navigation

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:13,640
assistance so if you came of age at the

00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,410
same time as me and studied around the

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,840
same time it's like actually a bit

00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,650
frustrating because it

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:25,400
kay it seems like a long time now seven

00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:27,560
years ago what do we do there a little

00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,940
more a little more outside and it's

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,529
actually getting closer to what we're

00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:35,950
doing so GPS denied navigation now with

00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:41,690
optical flow now of course others did as

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:43,760
well while following you will see that

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:46,460
people will talk about structure

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,830
following an inspection in the next 18

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,500
months a lot that's a thing now so

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,210
they're doing wall following and it's

00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,390
about right because you say on average

00:08:53,210 --> 00:09:02,410
it takes about a decade to go from

00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:04,400
research to industry so here we are and

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,930
interestingly enough the software

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:08,690
architecture of that thing is the same

00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:13,730
thing as today like no changes just

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:15,680
better software what we also well yeah a

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,860
little more visualization what we also

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,760
did is autonomous exploration now we're

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,040
not there yet

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
so we still have to catch up with it so

00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,029
what this drone is and it's not on a

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,839
tether it that's just sort of the safety

00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:32,180
mitigation with early technology what

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,910
it's doing it's finding out which areas

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:37,190
it doesn't know yet that's the green and

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:40,940
the blue line and then it's exploring

00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:43,250
these frontiers and I think it's going

00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,720
to make my PhD colleague Dominick really

00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:53,029
famous I'm sure he loves it and so it

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:56,870
finds its own way and navigates with

00:09:53,029 --> 00:10:00,020
optical flow and integration so autonomy

00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:04,100
to the last level like high level goal

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:08,720
is see the world go nothing else no

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:12,040
mission no planning it just goes there

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,890
is no such product today but they will

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:21,050
and based on my estimate in around three

00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:22,850
years so we've come a long way from

00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:25,760
research software that wasn't

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,690
productized worked once or twice or five

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,670
times to something that's deployed now

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:35,050
in hundreds of thousands if not

00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:41,510
of vehicles and that's hard that's

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:44,030
increment incredibly hard what I want to

00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:48,230
show and this is a great way to show it

00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:51,170
is how this is accelerating

00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:54,170
exponentially so we're having more and

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,060
more contributors which is important

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,150
it's actually incredible like we have

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:01,880
200 people here which means they're a

00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:06,380
lot more hundreds out there who are not

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:09,370
here today and as you can also see it

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:13,040
largely has been a firmware development

00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:19,220
but when you leave the summit don't talk

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:21,290
about px4 s firmware it's a stack it's a

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,780
collection of software that enables

00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:25,580
autonomy and we're starting to see that

00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,100
more and more because we had mostly

00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:30,380
firmware development but if you actually

00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,330
account for all the things that we're

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,460
developing and some of them have been

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,600
around longer but we were picking up

00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:40,130
contributors now it's a whole thing

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,750
where we're getting heavier and heavier

00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:49,520
on computer vision on interfacing with

00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:51,830
the world through the SDK and so it's

00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,170
getting more complex which drives this

00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:56,470
exponential growth also drives

00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:58,880
exponential cost which means as a

00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:03,590
company you need to share the workload

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:07,900
you can't do it yourself anymore you can

00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:11,660
see also that we have a majority of

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:13,280
independent contributors or from from

00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,280
smaller companies that are not members

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:20,300
and then you see some heavy hitters that

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:23,270
was 2018-2019 for sure will look a bit

00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:24,950
different and that's good so we have

00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:27,860
companies that have huge contributions

00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:30,380
significant buy-in but we also have a

00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:33,380
very healthy long tail of contributors

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:36,200
that's what you want you want breadth

00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:40,660
but then people who actually put effort

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,660
into it stand behind it and push it and

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:45,110
those are all the contributors in the

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:48,709
core project

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:50,930
it's now you know we've generated this

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:52,450
like a couple weeks ago so don't be

00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,760
offended if you're not on there

00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:59,480
but we get pretty good coverage with

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,230
this picture and that's awesome that's a

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:08,870
lot of people and it's growing it can it

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:11,420
continues to grow very fast so in

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,209
talking about px4 and talking about the

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,670
stack I think it's most useful to think

00:13:14,209 --> 00:13:19,880
of sort of what we used to refer to as

00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:24,040
firmware it's kind of the kernel but

00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,040
then we have a lot of things around it

00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:29,810
we have the hardware standards on

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,890
pixhawk we have the communication

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:36,230
protocol nav link we have the SDK which

00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:39,769
has the old logo here well we'll have a

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:42,940
new one and of course we have the

00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:46,100
industry association drone code we have

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,890
we have also third-party projects that

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:52,220
are really important really close bras

00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:53,240
talia's here which is awesome so that's

00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,860
all part of it

00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,560
the same way as if you talked about

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,449
Linux yes you're talking about a kernel

00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,790
but actually what you kind of mean is

00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:04,670
this whole big thing that's installed on

00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:06,890
your computer which is thousands of

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:14,060
software packets outside of just a

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:16,670
computer so this is sort of the core

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:19,459
stack and then a couple of hardware

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:20,990
targets that we run on I think this will

00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:28,220
look very different by the end of this

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:33,949
year and it's great when technology

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:37,279
works and loses connection so these are

00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:39,740
the products and I'm sure I didn't get

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,860
full coverage here that are using our

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:48,490
technology so it's a lot it's a lot of

00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:51,380
different things its cargo drones it's

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,970
small drones large drones it's it's

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:58,550
crazy it's everything and it's in

00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:02,720
different verticals

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:04,790
so I think what we're seeing is consumer

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:12,790
drones from unique from teal from other

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:15,770
companies from yeah like quite a number

00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:18,190
then commercial I think this is actually

00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:23,930
where the bulk of adoption right now is

00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:27,920
this is where we have unique but then

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:30,440
also a lot of other drones like the if'

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,990
750 AE which is a reference design for

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,520
high-end commercial drones so I think a

00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,640
lot of you will be interested in that

00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:40,610
domain but then we have more and more

00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,640
industrial and I just want to introduce

00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:47,980
these categories because I think they

00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,980
will help us as a community to organize

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:55,940
and showing what I just showed in a

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,160
number of contributors you also can show

00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:01,790
that in how the software is developing

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:06,260
so we have this accelerating exponential

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:09,560
growth where you have a number of

00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:13,460
software packets that each start humble

00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:16,480
you know small thin and then as you grow

00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:20,870
them they are still manageable

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:26,060
individually but we tend to add one per

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:28,040
month already almost and so as you stack

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,350
slices you end up with an exponential

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:32,840
curve that is a good thing because we

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:34,820
have a lot more functionality it's a bad

00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,760
thing for anybody trying to do that

00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:41,960
themselves because the same thing is

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,540
cost and I also want to just you know

00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:49,150
you all know this but it's more getting

00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:53,090
to a point to to articulate it simply

00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:55,760
like now we all here in this room want

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:57,350
to make that better right but pretty

00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,210
much all of the developers here are

00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,360
professional right they're paid by a

00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:04,820
company so how do we how do you explain

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,030
what you're doing how you leverage that

00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:10,420
do you like start with it copy it and

00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:11,900
then make it better and have your own

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:14,480
now that

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:18,740
how it works the way it works is you

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:22,610
have your product and then you can have

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:24,200
your differentiation on top of it the

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:27,140
trick is to know what your

00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,030
differentiation is like what is it what

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:31,160
you're doing different better and

00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:35,990
usually you win as a company if you're

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:39,160
focused on the customer and so it's

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:41,720
important that as you go back and

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:43,310
develop your business in particularly

00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,590
for your startup you're kind of usually

00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:48,680
not looking so so much into it you just

00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,680
need something like think about what

00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,710
your differentiation is and think about

00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:56,720
from a software architecture perspective

00:17:53,710 --> 00:18:00,560
how can you make sure you can develop

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:03,380
your differentiation and stay involved

00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,300
contribute to upstream what kind of

00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,780
interfaces do you need what kind of

00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,080
layers

00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:12,500
what API is what abstractions it's

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,560
really important that you clear about it

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,820
and that you're coming back and

00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:21,170
articulating this to other developers

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:24,500
because that is the grease that allows

00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,870
collaboration to happen to be very clear

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,570
about it and then now the question is

00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,960
okay why do you care you care because if

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,330
you do this right then you're going to

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,430
be able to upgrade this on the next

00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,410
level and when I'm talking about

00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:42,410
upgrading I'm not talking about you know

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:45,950
a new px4 firmware version that's old

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:48,710
news flight control is not a way to

00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:50,570
differentiate that's over

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,490
that's like building your own operating

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:55,700
system that was over in the IT industry

00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:59,300
a very long time ago now what you

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:02,300
differentiate on is user facing features

00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,030
like how do you exactly capture data how

00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:08,120
do you transmit data how deep do you

00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:12,410
integrate different sensors to achieve a

00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:14,660
consistent capture result and then what

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,910
you need to be adding is things like

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:20,150
obstacle avoidance computer vision the

00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:22,070
SDK and when you do it right you just

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,500
move in time up here and you're not

00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,559
updating px4 know you're adding more of

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:29,860
the stack

00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:33,059
and a lot of it will run on the computer

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:36,820
next to the core flight controller and

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:38,200
that computer which usually handles the

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,470
mission so I call it the mission

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,270
computer that is going to be more and

00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:47,190
more important and we've already built

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,190
out the infrastructure to handle that

00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:54,340
what I also want to make very clear is

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,770
we're at an inflection point the drone

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,630
industry has been growing and all of you

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:01,059
come into this and think like oh there

00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,940
are a lot of companies and you know it's

00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:08,620
sprawling mmm

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:12,880
excuse me Ramon water would be awesome

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:14,529
it's really sprawling and it's it's

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,679
great and you know all these different

00:20:14,529 --> 00:20:20,770
things and people try different things

00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,120
yes that's true but I won't surprise you

00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,460
when I tell you it's not going to stay

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,110
that way because there has been an

00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:32,169
industry that has been in the same shape

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:37,330
and that's cars so what we see here is a

00:20:32,169 --> 00:20:40,270
Ford Model T and that has a number of

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,309
important connotations and I'm trying to

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:45,340
train your pattern-matching a bit on

00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:47,409
drones you know create a bit of distance

00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:49,480
from yourself from this industry and

00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:52,210
look at the patterns and so what you see

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,059
is it kind of it has product market fit

00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:56,770
so it has wheels it has a suspension it

00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:58,779
has a fuel engine well that that's kind

00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:02,799
of going away but still it has a

00:20:58,779 --> 00:21:06,370
steering wheel it has four seats not two

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:09,159
and so you can call this the first

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:11,140
product market fit of a car and we've

00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,500
actually now changed that much about it

00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,260
in the last hundred years all the

00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,679
details got better and then it has

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:25,090
something else that is not visible it's

00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:27,549
manufactured on a production line now if

00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,240
you know drone companies if you're part

00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:33,010
of one do you have a production line or

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,049
do you have a table and then one person

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:36,159
working on a drone finishing there and

00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,460
there is another table with another

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,460
drone

00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,710
we're kind of in between not a lot of

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,080
people have a production line yet but

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:48,149
Ford had and it drove prices down to a

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,830
point where it was actually affordable

00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:55,559
enough to be relevant as an industry

00:21:51,830 --> 00:22:00,059
we're right at that point now let me

00:21:55,559 --> 00:22:02,059
show you something else the number of

00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:07,169
car manufacturers actually was around

00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:10,649
5,000 in the 1900s right pretty much

00:22:07,169 --> 00:22:14,149
like one or two people working on a car

00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:17,090
in a barn manufacturing five cars a year

00:22:14,149 --> 00:22:20,100
does that sound familiar

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:24,809
maybe manufacturing 200 cars that's

00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:27,149
still nothing and so there was this

00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:29,309
growth because people actually thought

00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:32,399
like oh it's actually working like

00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,679
people wanted and then there was a steep

00:22:32,399 --> 00:22:36,929
decline because as you go from this

00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:39,509
which is I don't know if you call this a

00:22:36,929 --> 00:22:41,309
two-seater or one-seater it's actually

00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:43,289
an Opel like if you're familiar with

00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,259
European car brands you're not

00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:50,309
associating that with the first car and

00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:54,720
innovation Ford model-t then we have

00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:56,279
this and you know those are you know one

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,460
has a roof but other than that it's not

00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,080
anymore fundamentally different but

00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,059
there's a steep drop-off and that's

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,399
really important to embrace because what

00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:07,919
happened well it the complexity reached

00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:10,619
a level where you can't just build

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,990
everything yourself and you had even

00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:18,559
things like bolts and nuts and screws

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:20,850
who were bespoke it's incredible but

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:24,809
standardization in the mechanical

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:30,299
industry didn't happen before 1900s 1917

00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:34,259
in Germany and 1918 in the u.s. that's

00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:36,419
incredible so all the steam engines were

00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:39,629
manufactured with you know ok I need

00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:42,110
this crew so I'm going to make it one

00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:44,730
inch 2/3 of whatever

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,529
nothing nothing standardized nothing off

00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:51,059
the shelf that's of course not

00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:52,140
sustainable and so that standardization

00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,200
is what

00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,670
loud companies to continue to innovate

00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:00,540
now the question is what is the

00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:04,260
equivalent of that today it's open

00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:09,330
source it's open source because writing

00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:12,990
standards is taking forever so it's

00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:14,940
really hard to actually standardize you

00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,380
know something that you don't quite know

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,330
how it should look like

00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,770
like when we standardize obstacle

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:22,830
avoidance today like what should we

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:26,340
standardize do you know I at least know

00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,930
I don't know but there is a way to drive

00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:30,210
that in parallel by essentially

00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:33,500
developing a reference implementation as

00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:36,470
open source while you drive this and so

00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:40,460
you end up with something that's shared

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:43,020
that's common that's a known quality

00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:45,330
without the full overhead over

00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:47,460
standardisation process and once you're

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,990
done and you've proven that it works you

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:50,820
can actually go ahead and say like

00:24:48,990 --> 00:25:01,260
actually that's now the standard API in

00:24:50,820 --> 00:25:05,700
its stable so I also wanted to quickly

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:07,530
go through a road map because we've

00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:12,150
actually achieved a few things we're

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:14,810
lagging on others and I want to also

00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:17,700
hold ourselves a bit accountable to that

00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:19,530
so the longer we have these discussions

00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,050
on the next def summits I want to make

00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:26,010
sure that we're tracking this that we're

00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:27,780
successful in execution so for example

00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:29,670
daniel has put a lot of work into the

00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:32,750
drivers overhaul so I think we're making

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:34,950
good progress on the hardware testing

00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:37,020
we're making good progress that's

00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,430
awesome

00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,590
there are the things where we're lagging

00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:43,020
like for example there will be a big

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,070
push for secure boot loader this year

00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,720
because a lot of our adopters require it

00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:55,140
DMA we've made some progress it's not

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:58,070
there yet so overall I would say we're

00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,070
doing quite ok

00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:04,690
the 1-9 release was delayed compared to

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:06,909
what we wanted to achieve but

00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,960
that's okay we have really high-quality

00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:15,340
release we will have something that's

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:18,220
more in time next time and now we can

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,840
also look at well what's going to happen

00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:26,950
next

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:30,159
110 just a recap September and so that

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:32,169
is what we wanted to focus on based on

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:35,979
the last road map now I'm pretty sure

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:38,649
that by Friday evening this whole thing

00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:41,679
is completely obsolete and that's a good

00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:43,720
thing that's a good thing because in the

00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,419
discussions over the next two days we

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:51,609
will learn what is relevant and what is

00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:52,929
not what needs to be added I also want

00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:56,739
to show a few highlights that we

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:59,739
achieved well Quality Assurance as a

00:26:56,739 --> 00:27:01,690
process and I'm the more I showed this

00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:04,509
the more realize people actually don't

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:07,809
know so the weird thing that happens

00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:09,789
that's rejecting your poll request right

00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:11,799
this this weird thing where you have

00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:14,499
this one red X that's actually a fairly

00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:16,119
sophisticated process so let me quickly

00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:19,749
walk you through it so this is all

00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:22,629
standard right we all hopefully know how

00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:25,450
to contribute upstream but then what we

00:27:22,629 --> 00:27:27,879
have code review clear that's normal we

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:30,999
have automated module tests that run

00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:32,739
unit testing we have automated flight

00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:36,429
simulation that go through manual

00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:39,159
control a mission on VTOL on multicopter

00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:43,409
different things it all needs to pass

00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:46,899
that and we have a physical flight tests

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:48,669
by our team in Mexico who go out and fly

00:27:46,899 --> 00:27:53,669
every day unless they're at the

00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:56,739
developer summit which is also good and

00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:58,840
so that's actually a fairly complete

00:27:56,739 --> 00:28:00,729
process already for an open-source

00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:03,639
project now we want to double down on

00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:06,700
every of these aspects we want to have

00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:09,999
more on Hardware testing want to have

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,979
more simulation testing we were going to

00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:15,279
let we're going to leverage MAV SDK

00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:17,019
heavily and we're going to synchronize

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,309
the tests that we are doing in

00:28:17,019 --> 00:28:19,989
simulation

00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:23,229
with the tests that are being done

00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:26,529
outdoors so we get to really high

00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:30,340
coverage numbers and a really high test

00:28:26,529 --> 00:28:33,669
traceability so I would love to invite

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:37,779
you all to contribute to that and also

00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:40,330
expect that having a unit test and

00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:43,029
having a simulation test as part of the

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:46,679
pro request is going to be a requirement

00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:49,659
going forward because we're putting

00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,570
drones above people's heads and we have

00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:58,809
responsibility to go to the highest

00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:00,639
levels of quality assurance then what

00:28:58,809 --> 00:29:04,539
we're also doing on the drone code level

00:29:00,639 --> 00:29:08,019
is type certification type certification

00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:11,139
that's that sounds pretty crazy but

00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:12,330
we're certifying it's always specific to

00:29:11,139 --> 00:29:15,159
an aircraft

00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:17,559
we're certifying an aircraft so they are

00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:19,989
essentially saying well we trust your

00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,309
failsafe modes we trust your operation

00:29:19,989 --> 00:29:26,499
we trust your engineering and anybody

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:28,899
using px4 on this particular airframe

00:29:26,499 --> 00:29:31,419
but then also on others as you run

00:29:28,899 --> 00:29:33,489
through a certification process are

00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:37,889
allowed to do things that are usually

00:29:33,489 --> 00:29:41,619
not allowed to do for example you're

00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:43,839
allowed to fly at night which is not

00:29:41,619 --> 00:29:46,119
allowed by default by FA you're allowed

00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,339
to fly over people and you don't need to

00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:51,129
get a special waiver you just can

00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:56,859
because this particular aircraft is

00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:59,759
fulfilling the requirements so that's

00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:02,889
ongoing going to keep you updated on it

00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:06,580
but that's an important milestone for

00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:07,869
the industry what we're also doing and

00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:12,339
this is something that is driven by

00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:16,960
Daniel and David is on Hardware testing

00:30:12,339 --> 00:30:20,859
so running all the boards running unit

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,379
tests on boards making sure CPU load and

00:30:20,859 --> 00:30:25,299
everything is OK and we're also going

00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:27,820
now towards Hardware in the loop testing

00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:30,729
so these boards go out and fly without

00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:32,080
leaving their rack and that helps us

00:30:30,729 --> 00:30:32,830
ensuring quality

00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:39,429
across all these different

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:42,279
configurations now this is maybe the

00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:45,940
most important slide because it's a big

00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:50,169
change it's a big change because we're

00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:54,760
as a software team not going to stay on

00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:59,740
the microcontroller px4 is moving very

00:30:54,760 --> 00:31:03,309
quickly to be not a middleware per se

00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:06,490
but a distributed stack that's running

00:31:03,309 --> 00:31:09,100
on the fly control side using a

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:13,210
publish/subscribe system called Europe

00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:15,789
that you've all used to also interface

00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:17,740
directly with Ross - and to add things

00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:20,230
like vision based navigation obstacle

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:23,700
avoidance I mean there's now a px4 /

00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:27,549
avoidance repository that says a lot and

00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,070
also connecting with the SDK and that's

00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:32,380
going to run on the wide variety of

00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,880
onboard computers from very small arm

00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:38,679
boards to very high Intel solutions and

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,440
I know that a lot of you have worked on

00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:43,870
that as part of academic research or as

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,360
part of a prototype but we're completely

00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,909
standardizing this there's going to be

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,620
one way to do it and it's going to be

00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:53,769
simple and it's going to be something

00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:56,039
that everybody does because we cannot

00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:58,480
get to the next level of autonomy

00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:02,980
without providing the infrastructure

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,409
across this hybrid system and what will

00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:08,769
remain here will be the safety critical

00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:10,210
parts because the regulator's want us to

00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:14,980
have something that's boxed up

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:16,899
controlled authenticated and what they

00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,450
can essentially say well ok we trust

00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:23,169
this particular component which leaves

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:25,120
us the freedom to go bananas on the

00:32:23,169 --> 00:32:30,100
mission computer and build great

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:34,330
autonomous software and what you can do

00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:43,240
with this is then really avoid obstacles

00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:45,490
and this is a pretty basic demo but

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:48,429
something that's going to be

00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:54,790
really required as a default avoiding

00:32:48,429 --> 00:32:56,710
things like polls and inspections and I

00:32:54,790 --> 00:33:00,130
want to bring this to pretty much every

00:32:56,710 --> 00:33:01,780
px4 enable drone by default it's also

00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:03,780
something that's highly relevant if

00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:07,420
you're doing things like a survey

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:11,980
because you might forget about that

00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:13,360
elevation that bush tree poll that's in

00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:16,540
there and this is something that's

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,970
working today we're working on getting

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:23,309
this in ready to fire platforms like the

00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:27,540
eye of 750 like a smaller developer quad

00:33:23,309 --> 00:33:27,540
but that's something you can use today

00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:36,580
and that's where all Terran is investing

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,380
heavily and really building software

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,960
from the ground up to enable this

00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:44,490
community not just fiddling a bit with

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,490
it or polishing it slightly

00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:59,770
good

00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:08,450
now the next step that's going to unlock

00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:11,869
a lot of integrations is the SDK and we

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:14,750
have a dedicated session from Jonas and

00:34:11,869 --> 00:34:17,510
Julian about it so I'm just introducing

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:21,230
the high-level concept look at the

00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:25,129
schedule attend the session but it's a

00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,349
really rich environment that has

00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:29,810
language bindings for all the major

00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:33,200
languages you care about a really high

00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:35,450
performance C++ core so you can deal

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,510
with lots of connections lots of drones

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:40,280
if you need to and that sits on top of

00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:44,330
MAV link that's why it's called MAV as

00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,389
DK and makes it easy to interface px4

00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:48,950
powered drones and of course we're

00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:51,080
striving towards standard so we're

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:53,720
really just targeting MAV link but at

00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:57,589
the same time given the context here

00:34:53,720 --> 00:35:05,300
we're making sure that px4 is sticking

00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:10,099
to the mapping standard and the other

00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,869
thing is airspace integration so we've

00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:15,560
talked about this a lot of times this is

00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:17,420
just a reminder there is already an

00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,089
integration of the air map service I

00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:22,250
hope we will have more integrations just

00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:26,570
remember that that's around and can be

00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:28,339
leveraged and then we're pushing towards

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:32,000
safety and certification on a number of

00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:34,640
fronts and it's kind of a bit diverse

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,330
right now because regulators don't know

00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,130
what they want to actually require so

00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,680
what we're doing is we're laying the

00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:45,619
foundations towards functional safety

00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:49,730
we're looking at automotive standards

00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:53,420
because those are more balanced in terms

00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:55,700
of complexity and safety than the very

00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:58,460
high-end manned aviation standards and

00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:01,960
we're doing our homework right now on

00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,960
many different fronts

00:36:03,309 --> 00:36:08,979
I think that's also really important for

00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:11,499
this community and this is something

00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:17,259
that all terian and others are very

00:36:11,499 --> 00:36:23,709
interested in now we've already seen

00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:24,189
that and then there is a new aspect to

00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:27,669
it

00:36:24,189 --> 00:36:28,900
that's hardware now if you're in

00:36:27,669 --> 00:36:31,959
software you kind of things like

00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:35,349
hardware what's the thing do I care it's

00:36:31,959 --> 00:36:38,949
actually really important and I created

00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:43,449
the pixhawk autopilot with a small team

00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:46,329
in 2013 at the same time as creating px4

00:36:43,449 --> 00:36:49,150
so we had this great consistency and we

00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:52,079
had very little hardware problems other

00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,519
than our lack of experience at the time

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,709
but now what's happening more and more

00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:59,859
is that we have this prowling hardware

00:36:56,709 --> 00:37:02,319
ecosystem where you have safety problems

00:36:59,859 --> 00:37:03,969
because the power supply works

00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:06,939
differently because the sensor is

00:37:03,969 --> 00:37:08,799
interfaced differently because one board

00:37:06,939 --> 00:37:12,359
is temperature calibrated another is not

00:37:08,799 --> 00:37:15,669
that's not how we're going to get to a

00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:20,140
enterprise-grade software platform and

00:37:15,669 --> 00:37:24,849
that's why we've decided it's time again

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:28,329
for full reference designs for an actual

00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:30,699
autopilot module that can be

00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:35,549
manufactured consistently by partners

00:37:30,699 --> 00:37:40,679
and so there's a pixhawk developer call

00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:43,959
on Tuesdays but we're also driving

00:37:40,679 --> 00:37:46,329
towards having hardware that is more

00:37:43,959 --> 00:37:48,219
consistent helping manufacturers get the

00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:52,329
core right and then enable them to

00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:54,159
differentiate on whatever additional

00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:59,079
functionality want they want to build on

00:37:54,159 --> 00:38:01,479
what additional services baseboards so

00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,130
we're not going to to build one version

00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:05,890
of this but we're going to give them a

00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,890
design that has been completely vetted

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:11,559
from the start which is pretty much what

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:13,719
pixhawk was right the same thing design

00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:17,200
networks now go out and build your own

00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:24,299
change the form factor innovate on top

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:27,609
but keep a consistent system so this is

00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:29,619
sort of the early prototype this doesn't

00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:31,450
exist yet there's in discussion with the

00:38:29,619 --> 00:38:33,190
hardware development community but it

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:38,230
will have a hundred pin expansion

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:41,680
connector it will have Ethernet as a new

00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:45,510
interface for 2019 compounding computers

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,510
mission computers really relevant and

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:52,290
we're going to help the whole industry

00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:52,290
by providing a reference design on that

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:58,960
good with that and just in time thank

00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,549
you all for coming and I'm really

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,470
looking forward to really in-depth

00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:04,660
discussions over the course of the next

00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:16,930
two days is there any questions from the

00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:19,420
audience yes let me repeat the question

00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:21,430
first what is the status of the FAA work

00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,890
and if you can give a little bit more

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:27,819
overview about it so working with

00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:31,599
regulators means that things of course

00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:34,359
take a long time to develop and that's

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:38,710
something that has been done by drone

00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:41,049
code over the past two years and the

00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:42,849
current indication is that we should be

00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:47,700
through the process in the next three

00:39:42,849 --> 00:39:51,790
months that is the indication by FAA now

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:54,130
they're doing this for the first time so

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:58,599
just let me repeat that they doing it

00:39:54,130 --> 00:40:00,670
for the first time but we will see but

00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:07,270
we have indications that it should be

00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:10,170
around the corner any other question all

00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:10,170
right thank you Lawrence

00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,179
