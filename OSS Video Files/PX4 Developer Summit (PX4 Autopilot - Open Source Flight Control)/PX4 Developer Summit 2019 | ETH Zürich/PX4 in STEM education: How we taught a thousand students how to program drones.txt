hello i'm andre CTO of copter express

00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:24,289
and today we will tell you about

00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,810
application application of px4 platform

00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:29,960
I will tell you about our company and

00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,450
the power of drones in education I'm

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:34,579
Alex ich like FM CEO of cultural express

00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,820
and I'll tell you about our community

00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,710
our competitions and our students

00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:41,719
projects

00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:43,160
hello I'm Alec I am the lead developer

00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:45,410
in culture express and I'm going to tell

00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,829
you more about the technical approach we

00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:50,840
have chosen for our software framework

00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:55,220
before we begin our presentation we

00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:57,530
would like to make a small spoiler we

00:00:55,220 --> 00:01:02,149
now will start a conference call with

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:05,810
Kazan Russia where on competition which

00:01:02,149 --> 00:01:10,310
is called Russian robotics Olympiad our

00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,960
drone kids are used by children to

00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,549
compete with each other

00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:33,909
so please see what's going on it's

00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:46,729
livestream something goes wrong Wi-Fi

00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:48,079
every one more time okay so few words

00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:51,380
about this competition

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,229
it's robotics competition for school

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:58,999
students and students from all over the

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:02,329
Russia now are in Kazan and they compete

00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:06,139
for a who can program autonomous flight

00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:09,860
with drone better and our platform use

00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:12,470
px4 and it's the EXO ps4 is leading

00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,560
platform in these competitions and I

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:16,310
hope we will show you how it works in

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,250
real life

00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:25,380
ok then we begin our presentation and

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:29,220
maybe we will call later yes ok ok so

00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:32,640
our company was founded in 2013 in

00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,610
Moscow Russia we are called copter

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,150
Express because our primary goal was to

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:45,750
start commercial delivery of goods with

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:48,840
drones so in 2014 the first pilot

00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,680
project was started the delivery of

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:56,460
pizza in Russian city of sect of car

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,580
this project was a great success as an

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:01,830
advertising campaign it was first

00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,340
regular commercial delivery with drones

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:08,520
and media all over the world told about

00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,850
us and about this delivery of pizzas

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:14,370
with drone in northern Russian city this

00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,390
project lasted about for about a month

00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:22,050
and it was successful as advertising

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:26,070
campaign but not so from economical and

00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:30,900
legal sites because the delivery my

00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:37,260
expensives and Russian laws wasn't ready

00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:39,750
for such a use oil of UAVs so then we

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,630
started to think how can we make

00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:45,150
delivery better and cheaper and we

00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:49,050
realized that piloted delivery and this

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:51,750
was piloted is not the way to go and we

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:55,350
started to work on autonomous flights

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,130
and autonomous delivery and in 2016 in

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,010
Samara

00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:03,510
we started our first autonomous delivery

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,970
project using the drone on pixhawk

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,510
autopilot with APM firmware and

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:13,650
Raspberry Pi single board computer we

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:16,770
program the it to fly from point to

00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:20,130
point and then recognize Arouca tech

00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:23,280
it's marker like QR code and gentle and

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,060
precisely on this market so we're

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:31,800
working on autonomous delivery nowadays

00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:36,030
too but also now we work on some other

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,880
projects with autonomous drones like our

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:39,560
autonomous monitoring solutions we

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,070
decided

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:47,180
to add the automatic charging station to

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:50,960
our drone system so drone can be

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:54,470
programmed to perform flights by some

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,790
time of schedule and without any

00:04:54,470 --> 00:05:02,510
attendance so this system can work fully

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:05,570
autonomously for quite a long time but

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,780
of course there is some there are some

00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:11,510
problems with autonomous drones

00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:14,150
reliability concerns and now we are on a

00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:17,780
pilot project stage of this development

00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:21,950
we just completed source a successful

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,770
pilot project when this station was used

00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:29,870
without our attendance for several weeks

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:33,710
in an oil production site in Russia so

00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:38,750
that's our short story of our company as

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:42,229
industrial drone builder but in 2015 in

00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:45,140
Russia's interest in robotics have risen

00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:50,000
and we set our eyes on educational

00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:52,669
market that time in Russia both state

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,669
and private educational institutions

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:59,180
were eager to introduce some course on

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:02,810
robotics as part of their curriculum so

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,660
we started to develop the educational

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:09,740
drone kit and started to think how can

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:12,169
we use drones in education there are

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:15,620
several approaches to drones in

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:18,560
education first and the most obvious is

00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:22,190
to use a ready to fly drone some kind of

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:27,110
small drone to teach students how to

00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:29,720
pilot drone how to program it but is in

00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:32,360
the same time the least interesting and

00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,000
powerful way of using drones because we

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,870
can teach how to engineer the drone and

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:43,010
students can't realize how drone really

00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:46,389
work so some time ago special

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:50,630
educational products like modular drones

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:53,240
were offered modular drone is a drone

00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:56,240
which meant specifically for

00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:00,259
and consists of several parts like one

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,389
part is ESC + motor + prop and then

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:08,449
students can't SM can assemble this

00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:10,550
drone and pilot it so they can get a bit

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:13,280
more information about how their own

00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:16,009
works but they still can't go to the

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,770
shop buy real parts and assemble real

00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:21,800
large drone and found some kind of very

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,349
cool startup withdrawn so is the most

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,530
powerful but the most complicated way of

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:30,830
using drones for education is to provide

00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:34,970
the drone as kid of common parts which

00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:37,639
can be assembled by students so they

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:41,000
will have to realize how drone really

00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:45,530
work and then they have to configure it

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:47,810
to pilot or program it so we decided to

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:49,849
go with the last approach as the most

00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:52,039
powerful and providing the most

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:57,650
opportunities for us to use drones in

00:07:52,039 --> 00:08:00,860
education but we wanted to teach not

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:03,349
only not only how to fly using remote

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,659
control we wanted to teach how to

00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:09,229
program the drone so they could fly

00:08:05,659 --> 00:08:12,830
autonomously and so we are entering the

00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:17,750
field of Robotics and robotics education

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:20,389
and robotics is not the easiest thing to

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:22,699
teach because it's very young field and

00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,469
it advances very quickly so it's very

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,740
interesting because of that but at the

00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:31,250
same time the educational materials are

00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:34,969
somewhat lakyn for example if you

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:38,450
compare documentation of rows with dogs

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:41,570
for some kind of modern popular stylish

00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:44,990
JavaScript framework JavaScript dogs are

00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:47,720
like almost digested information which

00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:51,020
you could consume really entertaining

00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:53,779
and roast documents are just like raw

00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:58,880
food and you really need to want it to

00:08:53,779 --> 00:09:01,279
it so we thought how can we provide

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,880
something that will be powerful and that

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,550
will be close to real adult robotics but

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,730
at the same time

00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:13,090
that will be user-friendly so we can we

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,560
could teach like 12 years old students

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,760
how to use it

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,770
so we had three alternatives we could

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,830
just not to use complicated tools and

00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:27,400
make some kind of simple platform so

00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:30,670
students couldn't understand it or we

00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,230
could create some kind of wrapper which

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:38,410
would hide the complexity of the

00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:41,040
complicated toast so children could use

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:43,810
it or the third way is to create

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,950
documentation so awesome so brilliant

00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:49,750
that even schoolchildren could

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:52,930
understand how all of this works we

00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,990
decided to go with some mix of the

00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:03,400
second and the short approaches so we

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:07,030
developed our educational drum kit our

00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:10,210
educational drum kit is a kit to

00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:15,340
assemble a programmable quadcopter like

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:17,890
this so we called it clever kit and not

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,620
only because you can make these drones

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:23,950
really clever but also because clever in

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:27,100
Russian is the word for clover yeah it's

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:31,840
pronounced clever and four leaf clover

00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:35,050
is not only the symbol of happiness and

00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:39,400
luck but also it resembles the

00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:44,200
quadcopter so we called it clever and we

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:47,110
ship it at kit or fully unassembled just

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,410
parts so teachers can educate children

00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:53,350
how to build quadcopter how to configure

00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:57,870
it how to fly using remote control and

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:57,870
then how to program autonomous flight

00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:04,660
talking about hardware we needed to

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,780
build the drone so it wouldn't be too

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,300
expensive but it should be very tough

00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:15,450
because students like crashing drones

00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:19,390
like crazy very much so we built a frame

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,930
which is partly carbon and very tough

00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:23,649
and

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:26,230
the protection parts are all of acrylic

00:11:23,649 --> 00:11:29,020
glass which can be very very cheaply cut

00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:34,300
on the laser cutter so we can provide

00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:38,410
them for almost no price no talking

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,899
about software we had two primary goals

00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:44,380
on the one hand we needed to provide

00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:47,200
some kind of simple API so students

00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,170
could quickly start to programs with

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:55,709
drones and on the other hand we needed

00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:58,570
to provide some kind of some kind of

00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:02,560
navigational systems for indoor flights

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:06,459
because when you use drone outdoor you

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,430
of course could use GPS but the of

00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:12,760
course the majority of our lectures and

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:14,800
lessons are indoor in schools so we

00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,529
needed to create some kind of indoor

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,410
navigational system and the sort but

00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:26,320
crucial part of our kit is our

00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:27,970
documentation and this previous slide

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,589
yeah

00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:32,350
the interesting question for this

00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,910
conference is why we chose px4 as our

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:39,100
app autopilot and pips for flights tech

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,160
to create educational drone you need

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,620
your auto pilot to be flexible because

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,240
you need to use it in different

00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:52,839
educational institutions to be feature

00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,550
full to have some features like low

00:12:52,839 --> 00:12:57,520
level control or indoor navigation

00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:59,170
support which we need for education but

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,800
in the same time it should be simple

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:05,709
because students should know learn how

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,410
it works it also should be stable and

00:13:05,709 --> 00:13:11,079
made sure so students doesn't face any

00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:13,959
problems regarding our platform itself

00:13:11,079 --> 00:13:16,480
and not their knowledge and they should

00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,959
the autopilot should have large

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,540
community because the community can help

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:25,240
us and students with any problems and

00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:28,810
develops this former browser as always

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,720
evaluated all the available firmwares

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,730
when we created our platform and in fact

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,820
px4 is the sort place

00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:40,029
form which we used we used cc3d with

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:42,850
arduino some years ago and then for a

00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:46,329
very brief moment we used a p.m. flight

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:53,110
stack but moved quickly to px4 and quite

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:55,420
regulated so the sort and very very

00:13:53,110 --> 00:14:00,670
important part of our educational

00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:03,519
product is our documentation we wrote a

00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:06,010
large volume of documentation which

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,459
covers all the topics that students need

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:13,089
to know to assemble the drone to

00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:16,060
configure it to upload firmware to set

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:19,149
it up to fly using remote control to

00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:22,570
communicate with raspberry pi to make

00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:24,399
scripts to fly autonomously and this

00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:28,510
documentation is available at our

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,220
website our main version of

00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,410
documentation is in Russian because

00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:34,990
almost all of our students are

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:38,019
russian-speaking and many of them even

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:41,529
don't know English well enough to read

00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:43,709
it because they're like 12 years old we

00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:48,519
translated this documentation to English

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:50,079
so you can check it out yes and now I

00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,660
want to tell you more about our

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:55,420
community that we create in four years

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:59,290
at first first of all I want to show you

00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:01,420
this map if each place mark is one of

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:03,490
centre of STEM education or school or

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,350
college in Russia where you can learn

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:09,250
something using our educational drone

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:12,220
kid from Kaliningrad to Sakhalin across

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:16,930
Russia it's very exciting and we made it

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:19,720
in four years and what looks passed for

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:22,899
the student right now we will tell about

00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,970
it with an with an R a from two sides

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,060
the first about science and education

00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:31,660
and the second one as the second part

00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:35,290
about competitions and different

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,540
contests and benefits that they can have

00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:40,839
with our educational drum kit but first

00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,290
of all we make some work and we're ready

00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:47,579
to call we we will call to Russian

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:50,940
robotics Olympiad it's right

00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:58,649
right now and Thank You Ramon he helped

00:15:50,940 --> 00:16:04,940
us and yes it's work

00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:09,600
finally oh hello everybody my name is

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:13,699
and today we are like in the in the

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:18,769
Polish polish University in Kazan Russia

00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:18,769
via provides flying Robotics Challenge

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:37,079
the main tasks of these they were drawn

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:41,029
animal I became a fan since we kind of

00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:47,190
sensing from 10 regions in Russia

00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:52,920
this is civilians from a great and the

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:57,420
most of them use our image for a lazy

00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:05,579
eye so I reached good luck

00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:08,530
so our thank you swetha yes bye

00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:13,720
[Applause]

00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:16,980
yes yes and now about passive students

00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,789
in Russia let's start from school

00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:25,360
yeah let's discuss what we can teach

00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:28,600
using drones in schools the most obvious

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:32,320
thing that students can learn is how to

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,929
assemble and fly the drone and usually

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:38,710
that's where the school education with

00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:43,289
their own ends but in fact we can use

00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:47,909
drones to teach a whole set of different

00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:51,330
common subjects like for example physics

00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:55,720
topics like aerodynamics or electricity

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:58,659
can be covered using drone kids and it's

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,600
interesting for students but physics is

00:17:58,659 --> 00:18:04,179
not the only subject which we can teach

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,150
with drones because we also have design

00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:09,789
and engineering classes and children are

00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:12,850
really excited to make some part for

00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:16,030
drone instead of making some boring

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:20,110
unnecessary parts and when they should

00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:22,900
make something to complete a task for

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:25,179
example when drone must grip an object

00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:29,559
and then drop it somewhere in the room

00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:31,900
and they must make as a tool to grip

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,770
it's much more interesting for them and

00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:39,190
they do this with great interest but the

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:41,710
most interesting application as we think

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,770
of drones in school education is

00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:47,470
computer science classes because common

00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:49,929
computer science lessons are usually not

00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,799
too interesting for students and if

00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:57,520
student is not really a computer fan

00:18:52,799 --> 00:19:00,640
they don't they're not very useful but

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,730
everything changes when you propose to

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:06,130
code a drone because almost all the

00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:09,220
students are really excited to program

00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:11,919
the drones and they I think write what I

00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,470
can write some code as this drone will

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,590
execute my commands it will navigate

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:22,360
through the room it will it will grip

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:24,970
and drop objects it will fire

00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:28,540
another drones it's really really very

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:30,460
exciting for students so it's the most

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,720
interesting for us application of

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:36,850
educational drones and now when the

00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:39,910
interest in for programming is very high

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:41,800
we believe that schools should use

00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,700
drones for computer science education

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,610
more and more and what benefits they can

00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,190
learn when they using drones first of

00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:53,200
all they can join in university with

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,920
full scholarship if they win in

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,440
different contests in Russia for example

00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:01,870
this video from different competitions

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,840
one of them to delivery something food

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:07,810
after animals way and students from 30

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,590
to 15 years take part in it and the

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:16,120
winner can join university without exams

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:18,550
and it's really interesting for students

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,160
because they can make their first step

00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:23,380
in flying robots and it's not so hard

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:27,100
and it's very simple and they have a lot

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:30,340
of benefits but then they can join

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:35,080
college for example and make drones like

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:37,420
a profession yeah colleges are more

00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,830
about working professions so we

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:44,260
participated in creation of new Russian

00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:48,060
state educational standard which we

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:51,730
called unmanned aerial systems operating

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,240
using our educational solutions colleges

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:58,930
teach how to operate the drone how to

00:20:55,240 --> 00:21:01,000
fix maintain troubleshoot it and it's

00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:04,300
both interesting for college students

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,080
and interests and then for the their

00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:11,410
employers yes and the competition take a

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,660
big part in student's life because if

00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,690
they win in this competition they can

00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:20,560
find the best job is Russia is in Russia

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:22,930
it's very powerful to work is movement

00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:25,080
its championship of working profession

00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:29,680
it's an international championship and

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:32,050
in Russia the the best students who win

00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,290
in this competition can find the best

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,190
job because it's this competition

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:38,889
interesting

00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,440
or companies and for student it it can

00:21:38,889 --> 00:21:44,379
connect them each other and it's more

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,610
about working profession more about

00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:50,860
drone operating for example on this

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,539
competition you should travel shooting

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:57,460
your drone you should

00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:59,830
flying in fpv and flying fully

00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:03,490
autonomous you can show your knowledge

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:06,730
of drawn from different sides and it's

00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:10,149
really interesting for students to try

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:13,809
to make it but this only if you want to

00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:16,840
be an operator of drone but science is

00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:21,279
more interesting and you can use drone

00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:25,120
in it in university yeah our work with

00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:28,480
universities is enlarged in early stage

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:31,120
now but we really believe that drones

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,700
should be used more in universities

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,139
because you can use them both for

00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:40,809
education and for scientific research so

00:22:38,139 --> 00:22:43,860
talking about education drones can be

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:46,809
used with great success to teach

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:49,690
estimation and control theory computer

00:22:46,809 --> 00:22:54,159
vision some machine learning aspects and

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:57,460
a lot of different topics and if we talk

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:01,480
about research then researchers usually

00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:04,299
spend a lot of their time and effort to

00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,450
assemble the drone to learn how to

00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:10,659
operate it before they can start a

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:13,870
really scientific work so we believe

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:15,820
that there is a need for some kind of

00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:18,759
platform which can be used for

00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,519
scientific research in universities and

00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:24,429
we are now promoting our kids in Russia

00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:28,929
and collecting the feedback from

00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:31,450
academic community so we could offer the

00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,250
best platform for research and what's

00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:38,049
about interesting competition for

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:40,690
students and tutors it's I think most of

00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:44,919
all no conference iris it's a big

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:47,289
robotics conference each year and this

00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,000
year we will organize a competition and

00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:49,820
this conference and I hope to see

00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,399
someone

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,559
you it will six November in Macau it's

00:23:52,399 --> 00:23:58,100
about collaborative drone delivery of

00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,200
course food afternoons and I hope we can

00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:04,489
show the power of px4 at this

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:07,549
competition and use it but you know the

00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:09,950
main point why we why there is so many

00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:12,559
students in Russia loves to use drones

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,869
for programming it's our community

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,169
you can join community and each step in

00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:22,039
school in college in University and it's

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:25,039
interesting all the time

00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:27,229
and when you came to our community there

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,499
is a lot of people who want to help you

00:24:27,229 --> 00:24:33,679
because you know when we start we answer

00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:37,609
it and each question for ourselves but

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:41,210
right now people want to to help each

00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:44,509
other because it's people like to share

00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:46,700
their knowledge and we just need to give

00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:48,919
them a platform for discussion and for

00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:52,639
example in one of our chats there is

00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:56,059
Ramon yes yes and I believe that we can

00:24:52,639 --> 00:25:00,109
communicate a lot and show the best

00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:03,859
projects from Russia and to cooperate

00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:09,499
with drom code yes and our team is core

00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:12,649
of this community we start with seven

00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:17,119
employee in four years ago and now we

00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:22,389
grow to 70 we create an educational

00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:26,090
materials we develop our framework we

00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:29,570
organize competition helps to students

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:32,320
and tutors and it's very inspiring when

00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:35,509
you meet someone who used your

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,479
educational drunky it in every city in

00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:42,710
Russia and for us it's very important

00:25:38,479 --> 00:25:45,229
that teachers not only learn to assemble

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:47,749
drawn enter to fly because it's very

00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:51,769
important that they use drone as a tool

00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:55,519
to learn physics computer science and

00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:59,889
others and that's why we make we educate

00:25:55,519 --> 00:26:02,820
teachers it's very important part of our

00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:05,700
concept

00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:09,540
for example last year we educate more

00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:13,530
than 100 teachers from 26 cities from

00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:16,290
Russia and but it's not only in Russia

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,990
because this year at the beginning of

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:21,240
May there was a very interesting

00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:26,190
experiment we go to China and learn

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:28,440
Chinese teachers from college with our

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:31,050
conception of using drones indication it

00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:35,100
was very cool and we're interesting for

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:36,960
us because it's was our first step to

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,400
international to join international

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,430
community of educational drones and

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:50,040
drones interesting not only in education

00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:56,040
it's all all its useful for our business

00:26:50,040 --> 00:27:00,990
- yeah as Alex I told you our small

00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:03,570
start-up grew from 7 to 70 employees in

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:09,440
several years and that's because of

00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:14,700
success of our educational product our

00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:19,020
sales grew so now we sell more than 1000

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:23,280
of these kids per year and but we are

00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:26,640
not the only manufacturer of educational

00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:30,270
kids in Russia in fact there is a lot of

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,870
more of them and the question is what

00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:37,590
could help us to step aside and to

00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:41,940
dominate the market when we created our

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:44,400
kid we discussed a lot internally about

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:48,620
should we open source all of our

00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:51,480
software because of course many many

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:55,250
businessmen are afraid that if they

00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:59,340
share their code somewhere someone will

00:27:55,250 --> 00:28:04,200
come in and stole their hard work yeah

00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,910
and will offer the product which is more

00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:08,690
or less the same but for less price

00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:12,770
because they doesn't have to develop it

00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:15,600
but we decided that we couldn't create

00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:16,480
great educational product without

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,000
creating

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:22,330
unity around it and we couldn't create a

00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,420
community without going fully open

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:29,170
source so we decided to licensed under

00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:31,410
MIT all of our software and to open all

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:36,610
of our educational materials that

00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:40,290
allowed us to very quickly expand our

00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:43,570
vision on the educational platform and

00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:48,460
to collect a lot of very smart and

00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:52,060
brilliant people around us so from one

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:55,510
side yes there is some manufacturers who

00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:59,590
copy our product but they can't achieve

00:28:55,510 --> 00:29:02,350
any success in the market because they

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:05,200
don't have any community to help

00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:08,230
teachers to educate teachers to help

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:12,190
students and also they don't have our

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:16,780
expertise in field of copters and drones

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:19,990
so the hardware is inferior as well and

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:23,260
to confirm which I said I want to show

00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:25,810
you the market share of our company and

00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:28,840
another and manufacturers of educational

00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:32,710
drone kids in the rational market so we

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:34,990
now are more than half of Russian

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:38,770
educational market and all of our

00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:41,320
competitors use closed source model so

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:45,460
they publish only some kind of API and

00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:49,300
we went fully open source and it enabled

00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:53,020
us to dominate this market in Russia so

00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:55,090
we would recommend you to open source as

00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:58,060
much as you can if you are working in

00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:02,290
similar field because the advantages of

00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:04,900
such approach are far far or more

00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:08,980
important than the risks that you can

00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:12,460
have so I'm going to tell you a little

00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:14,350
bit about our software framework the

00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:16,300
goals of our software framework were

00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:18,340
actually to lower the barrier of entry

00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:20,290
to the world of flying robotics

00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:25,900
especially to the world of open-source

00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:28,000
flight controllers like px4 when we're

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,220
talking about the software that runs on

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,780
the companion computer

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:35,110
there are two main approaches how you

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,909
can do it the first parade approach is

00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,190
to create some library brace based

00:30:36,909 --> 00:30:41,620
solution like drone like John Keats or

00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:43,750
primal linker sounds like this it has

00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:46,330
some advantages because it's very easy

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,070
to the users they just import some

00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:50,909
Python model in their Court it's very

00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:54,460
easy but another approach is to do

00:30:50,909 --> 00:30:57,010
interpreters communication approach like

00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:59,919
Ross and maverick it has and it has a

00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,809
lot of a lot of advantages at first

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,870
there are great introspection and

00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:09,130
debugging tools like RPG Andros Andros

00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:13,740
topic and etc also you can do some very

00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:16,510
nice visualization like RV's also

00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:19,510
there's a lot of logging solutions like

00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:21,429
was back so we think that the most

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:25,809
appropriate appropriate variants for us

00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:28,210
is to use Ross and Mavros the second

00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:30,280
topic for us is the positioning system

00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:32,500
because it's very it's very difficult to

00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,299
a program drawn to do something sensible

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:37,390
without the presenters positioning

00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:42,340
system so of course outdoor you can use

00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:45,520
GPS and px4 works really nice with GPS

00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:47,500
but we don't want to make our students

00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:50,530
go outside every time they want to test

00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:52,809
their code so in the lab of course you

00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,860
can use something like motion capture

00:31:52,809 --> 00:32:00,730
system at it can give you very very good

00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:02,380
precise precise precision but for the

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:06,490
occasional purposes it's too expensive

00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:09,130
it costs a lot so the most appropriate

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:11,799
solution for us is to use the onboard

00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:14,559
camera based navigation we have a

00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:16,900
Raspberry Pi and the camera so we

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,740
developed two solutions to navigate

00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:20,230
indoors

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,100
the first is recognizing fiducial

00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:26,380
markers so we can compute the position

00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:29,440
of our drone relative to the marker or

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:31,539
to group of markers we call them markers

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,380
map and then we can use this information

00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:38,289
to navigate the second solution is

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:41,340
optical flow we just use the standard

00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:43,950
open series phase correlation method

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,550
and then we can compute the shift

00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:50,760
between two frames that camera sees then

00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:52,530
we can transform this shift to the angle

00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,930
and then we pass this information to the

00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:56,970
flight controller so this works really

00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:59,160
really well on Raspberry Pi so our drone

00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:02,690
can just hover of course it may be a

00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:06,090
little drifting but it is hovering then

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:09,060
the next topic is finding of board

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:11,880
because of course you can use automation

00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:14,640
to fly it anonymously but for indoor

00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,340
indoor flies it's very limited the only

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:20,570
thing it kept it can do it just flies

00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:24,510
through points so it's limited it's not

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,580
fits some fun tasks so flying enough

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:30,800
word is not so easy for our students for

00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:35,160
example if you try to write some sketch

00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:37,590
for Rome avarice to just take off then

00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,120
it would be look like this so our

00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:40,980
students should understand a lot of

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,220
difficult concepts of Rosse like

00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:47,010
publisher subscribers a call backs it's

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,990
too difficult for analyze programmers so

00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,270
we actually decided to create a simple

00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:54,900
wrapper around it and we called it

00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:58,800
simple of word so simple of word is just

00:33:54,900 --> 00:34:02,730
a Ross note it wraps some Mavros stuff

00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,310
and this is the project template for our

00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:09,030
students so simple of board is just an

00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:12,090
eight services and they allow the user

00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:14,310
to make different tasks and control the

00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:17,730
drones at different levels on the level

00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:19,980
of position rates velocity so for

00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:22,260
example the program that takes off it

00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,440
looks just like this is just one line of

00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,780
code so our students write like a one

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,510
line of code and the drone will take off

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:34,290
and have our using optical flow so as

00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:35,399
you see navigate function has the target

00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:38,909
point coordinates

00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:41,130
it has frame ID the frame ID is actually

00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:44,370
coordinate frame for the target points

00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:46,440
for the target points it's just a

00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:48,720
regular Ross frame like you know in my

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,970
roses base link which is attached to the

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:53,580
drone or map which is attached to the

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,140
origin of a local coordinate system but

00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,860
we also added another

00:34:55,140 --> 00:35:01,170
that we called body body is just like a

00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:03,480
base link frame but it's not tilt by

00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:05,790
roll and pitch so it's very easy to

00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,730
control the drone in terms of fly

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:14,520
forwards right left and something like

00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:17,850
this also thanks to Ross toolchain this

00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,040
can be performed just in one bash line

00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:22,800
so we just call the same navigate

00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,390
service and pass the same parameter

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,980
street and the drone will take off so

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:29,070
you can even program your drone using

00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,450
bash scripts then for example if you

00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,910
want you don't use your drone to fly

00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:37,140
left then you just say it set Y

00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:39,960
coordinates 2 to 2 for example and Y

00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:42,270
axis is points to the left so the drone

00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:44,340
will fly left then when you when you

00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:47,460
want you drone to fly on its initial

00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:50,430
position then you set Y to minus 2 and

00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,130
the drone beam will return then when you

00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:56,250
want to for example land we created a

00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:58,710
very simple thing you just call land

00:35:56,250 --> 00:36:00,570
service and don't don't care about you

00:35:58,710 --> 00:36:03,170
think you just switched the drone to

00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:06,750
auto land mode and the drone will lend

00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:09,890
so this is some example of a program you

00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:14,490
can do this you see you see that drone

00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:16,830
flies square and you see how easy is the

00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,200
program you just called navigate four

00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:21,990
times you just sleep until the drone

00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,820
reaches the target position so it's

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:28,740
really really easy and fun for our

00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:31,530
students also when you enable a rookery

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,230
cognition system on our platform

00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:37,200
each Arouca marker will create its own

00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:40,800
coordinate frame so if the drone sees

00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,620
the marker you can actually navigate to

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,800
the target point related to the marker

00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:50,310
which it sees so like in this example we

00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,200
set frame 82 Arouca underline 107 and

00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:56,790
the drone sees the marker and their gaze

00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:00,270
and hover above it moreover with the

00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:02,220
same line of code you can even make your

00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:05,700
drone to fly it towards the moving

00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,450
marker like in this video so this is

00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:12,060
just one line of code

00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:14,730
so this is using optical flow system but

00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,920
optical flow system has some feature the

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:19,130
general made might drift away because

00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,070
optical flow only compute the velocity

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:26,760
but there is a system that is called

00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:31,140
reason position estimation then you can

00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,750
use a map of markers then you input this

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,080
map to our configuration file file and

00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:38,700
then our system will calculate the

00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:42,990
position of the drone relative to this

00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:45,210
to this map and you can fly relative to

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:47,910
the map of the markers which this would

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:50,820
create an Erica map markers Erica map

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:53,340
frame so like in this example drone

00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,040
flies to the left edge of the marker map

00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:02,310
then it flies to the middle of the

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:05,700
marker map and then each lens okay now

00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:10,410
the next simple example that we can use

00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:12,930
to teach something our students is this

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,180
program makes the drone flies a circle

00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,850
this program is very interesting for

00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:19,109
education purposes because with this our

00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:22,230
students can understand the application

00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:24,720
of sine function cosine functions and

00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:27,119
geometry functions in so they can

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,750
program to drone to do something

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,490
interesting

00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:36,150
using this math math function also when

00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:38,130
you want to get the state of your of

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,890
your drone you don't need to subscribe

00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:44,430
to the topics you just call get

00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:46,830
telemetry service this service gets free

00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:50,280
MIDI as an input and give you everything

00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:52,740
about your own needs as an answer so the

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,240
frame ID is the coordinate frame for x y

00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:59,460
and z coordinates also it has attitude

00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,619
rates of the drone so for example if the

00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:03,990
drone sees a marker then you can set

00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,030
frame ID to aruch and underline the ID

00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:08,040
of this marker and you know the

00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:10,080
coordinates of the drone relative to the

00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,600
marker if it sees the marker so it's

00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:15,060
very useful so this is the example how

00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,560
it sees how it looks in Python you just

00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:19,530
call the function and get all the

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,590
telemetry because subscribers is maybe

00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:25,690
true to this

00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:27,880
to journalize then it's a lower level

00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:30,340
control on our platform

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,720
you also can set the desired velocity

00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:36,280
set the desired attitude and set rates

00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,680
this is useful for some aggressive

00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:41,710
maneuvers for example this is the code

00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,530
that executes that performs a flip with

00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:47,500
the drones as you see is very easy you

00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:50,440
just bump up for a little time

00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,810
then you set a rotating rate for your

00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:54,670
drone then you wait until the conditions

00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:56,910
are met and then you just return your

00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:00,940
drone to the position control mode and

00:39:56,910 --> 00:40:04,990
this is how looks the execution of this

00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:07,630
program so the drone takes off and then

00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:12,340
it's performed a flip then it's returned

00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:15,100
to its initial position and lands now we

00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:17,410
don't want to distribute our platform

00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,150
for our students as just packages or

00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,770
ross packages because install and ross

00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,740
packages and building ross packages is

00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:26,710
not so easy so we decided to create an

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,360
image for a Raspberry Pi so our students

00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:31,570
can just get this image and write it to

00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:34,300
SD card but we don't build this

00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:36,120
Raspberry Pi image manually instead we

00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,010
have a continuous integration system

00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:42,850
that use cameo emulator to emulate

00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:45,610
Raspberry Pi then we install everything

00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:48,790
you need mount raspbian image configure

00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:51,880
network so every out drone is a Wi-Fi

00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:53,800
access point installer Ross kinetic and

00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,700
some additional software for example we

00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,410
have this web interface when you get the

00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,570
links to all the web tools that are

00:40:59,410 --> 00:41:03,910
available or our platform for example

00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:05,890
you can use the documentation you can

00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:09,100
use some interesting visible

00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:12,370
visualization also many of our users use

00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:14,980
windows so we have wefts web terminal so

00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:17,560
you even using windows you can program

00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,750
your drone just using web browser and it

00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:21,910
will be a real program where it's not

00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:24,510
like it's it's real common line so you

00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:27,520
you know you learn a really cool stuff

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:31,090
this is nice a package that is called

00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,830
web video servers so you can view all

00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:34,210
the image topics that you have for

00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:37,839
example you can view the

00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:41,530
from your camera and we actually built

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:44,770
this image to each commit on our project

00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:47,589
and we ran tests so if something fails

00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:50,589
we know about it and how you see they're

00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:53,230
all the sort of all the stuff I tell you

00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:56,760
about is just hosted on github it's

00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:59,369
capture express slash clever so you can

00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,560
follow it you can check it out you can

00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:05,650
run it you can if you enter place

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,140
steroids if you like so this was a brief

00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:10,200
summary bout of our software platform

00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:13,359
and now Alex say will tell you about

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:19,810
actual projects that was created using

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:21,970
this platform thank you yes and I want

00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:24,670
to tell you about three most interesting

00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:27,700
projects that can show our platform from

00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:30,670
three point of view the first one is

00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:33,400
drawn show it's very popular in Russia

00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:37,560
school camps because you can make it

00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,570
very fast with our simple framework and

00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:43,270
it were exciting for step in robotics

00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:46,630
because you create something interesting

00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:49,630
for example this video made this week on

00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,940
Monday it's a show from school camp

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:57,640
where five-foot left arrows drawn makes

00:42:51,940 --> 00:43:01,300
flip clip one more child flip okay yes

00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,390
and it's a look very exciting for them

00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:07,630
because they understand why navigation

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:10,720
indoor it's so hard and how to create a

00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:13,930
control server to control all of these

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,589
drones the second project is about

00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:20,109
warehouse inspection team of students

00:43:16,589 --> 00:43:23,140
want to they have they find a problem

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:26,230
that it's takes a lot a bit a lot of

00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:29,800
time to scan all barcodes and they want

00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:31,420
to try to make it with drone they take

00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,930
our educational drunk it in our

00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:37,210
framework and make this project and the

00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:40,599
most interesting part that the students

00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:44,380
only 13 years old and they can create it

00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:46,810
by themselves it's fantastic because you

00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,160
know three years ago it was a problem

00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:51,700
even for us

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:55,930
and the third project it's very

00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:57,970
interesting because it's it shows how

00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:03,100
important to work with students and

00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:05,830
interns two students came to us in our

00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:09,490
internship program and they at first

00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:11,500
they assembled wrong then they start

00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:15,010
learning to fly but it was catastrophic

00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,930
they crash every time they fly two

00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:21,250
seconds and then repair drone for an

00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:25,120
hour but then they think huh we're not

00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:29,910
so good at piloting but we are great

00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:34,300
engineers maybe it's not only way to

00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:37,960
learn to fly we can create a fear

00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:41,950
protection around our drone then they

00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:44,400
make this first prototype it's it works

00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:47,860
and then they make the second version

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:51,600
they use carbon tubes in the second

00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:59,890
version it was very interesting and Dre

00:44:51,600 --> 00:45:02,350
second version thank you yes it works

00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:06,370
and they fly a lot of times they crash

00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:08,890
in the walls in the they crash with big

00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:12,100
high and drone is okay then they write

00:45:08,890 --> 00:45:14,500
an article and it became very popular in

00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:18,580
Russia we was very inspired by it and

00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:23,830
make a product yes you can see it I like

00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:28,990
always already turn it on it's a drone

00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:31,170
for delivery something indoor and we use

00:45:28,990 --> 00:45:35,620
it at a lot of Rome action you can see

00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:38,590
for example we usually delivery Suites

00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:42,250
with this drone because we upgrade it

00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:45,040
and make a cover of text to tower around

00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:48,070
our drone and it's very hard to touch

00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,400
props and it's almost fully safety to

00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:55,290
fly through the people and we more more

00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:59,080
than 20 PR events using this drone and

00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:01,340
it was very exciting for example it's

00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,490
delivery of water to

00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:08,690
speaker we also deliver a clicker and a

00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:14,270
lot of other things and the main point

00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:17,210
in this project is that how student

00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:20,240
project became a product of our company

00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:24,850
and because for us it's very important

00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:27,710
to take the most the most smart students

00:46:24,850 --> 00:46:35,000
came to our internship program and

00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:37,160
create some projects and now we create

00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,010
even you know it's a funny competition

00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,710
like drone wars you take two drones like

00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:48,050
this and you should crash and someone

00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:52,520
who can fly his wing and it's more it's

00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:55,190
very exciting to people who see it from

00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:57,230
the side because but it's not good for

00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:04,310
engineers because say they should repair

00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:07,400
drawn every time and now our platform is

00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:11,060
very good for projects and every year we

00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:15,710
make a big event in Russia it's copter

00:47:11,060 --> 00:47:20,000
Hawk we do you remember that we educate

00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:22,250
teachers and then once a year we call

00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,850
all teachers all students that use our

00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:27,470
educational platform in Moscow and for

00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:30,640
example last year there was two hundred

00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:34,370
of participants and they make some

00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:37,340
interesting projects on our Hecate own

00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:40,820
they have only 24 hours our educational

00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:46,030
drum kit and then can make all oh they

00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:50,810
want to add the Sun sensor started some

00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:52,910
different nodes as I want and for us

00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:55,910
it's very inspiring to meet people and

00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:58,850
hear their story how they use our drone

00:47:55,910 --> 00:48:05,630
what projects how they educate students

00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:10,220
and how they use our project and at the

00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:12,020
end I want to tell you so how we took a

00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:15,079
thousand students how to program drones

00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:22,249
you know there is three main

00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:25,640
the first one is that we make an easy

00:48:22,249 --> 00:48:29,089
framework a really simple flat framework

00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:32,109
and first step to flying robotics is

00:48:29,089 --> 00:48:36,349
very simple you need only one day to

00:48:32,109 --> 00:48:38,450
assemble drawn learn make you first fly

00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:42,410
and make first you make you first

00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:47,479
afternoon flight and it's very important

00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:49,880
that we use px4 and ross because our

00:48:47,479 --> 00:48:52,819
platform is very simple but it have a

00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:55,700
big potential to go deeper you can start

00:48:52,819 --> 00:48:59,749
from our platform and then understand

00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:02,420
how px4 work what Rose is at and many

00:48:59,749 --> 00:49:06,079
other things the second one because

00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,630
students have benefits it's very

00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,569
important because for students it's

00:49:08,630 --> 00:49:14,119
interesting with a practical way they

00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:15,109
can for example join University with

00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:18,769
scholarship

00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:23,660
just you make interesting project with

00:49:18,769 --> 00:49:26,150
drone and the third point that we create

00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:28,160
a big community in Russia and when you

00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:32,170
start to program drone it's very

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:34,699
important to talk to another people who

00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,279
who making something interesting with

00:49:34,699 --> 00:49:39,769
drones too because it's very inspiring

00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:43,209
when you talk with with someone online

00:49:39,769 --> 00:49:46,190
and then see this person offline in

00:49:43,209 --> 00:49:49,880
competitions in contests at hackathons

00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:56,630
and other different events you know like

00:49:49,880 --> 00:50:00,589
us here and we take these three simple

00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:05,380
three parts simple framework benefits

00:50:00,589 --> 00:50:08,749
and our community take them together and

00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:11,869
start a thousand students to program

00:50:08,749 --> 00:50:14,660
drones yeah but we've made all this way

00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:18,170
from Moscow not only to share our story

00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:21,170
but to promote the usage of educational

00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:24,199
drones in schools in colleges at all the

00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:27,259
stages of the education because the

00:50:24,199 --> 00:50:28,730
drone is the wonderful tool which can

00:50:27,259 --> 00:50:32,210
educate and

00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:35,960
inspire students at the same time and I

00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:38,930
believe now we need more than ever a lot

00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:42,320
of prot of inspired and talented

00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:45,430
engineers and developers so go to

00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:48,530
schools to colleges and inspire people

00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:51,590
with drones because it's really really

00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:54,110
absolutely motivating thing and I

00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,870
believe that in a few years when we will

00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:59,810
meet again at some summit many

00:50:56,870 --> 00:51:02,390
participants will say you know I started

00:50:59,810 --> 00:51:05,370
to work with drones at school and I love

00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:10,540
them thank you thank you

00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:15,490
[Applause]

00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:17,470
and and I'm sorry can you please make

00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:24,850
these for our colleagues from Russia

00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:31,770
one moment yes thank you are there any

00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:39,730
questions from the audience please

00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:42,100
please raise your hands so usually how

00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:47,980
long is your hackathon like one day 24

00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:51,310
hours it's usually from 24 to 80 to 48

00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:53,740
hours so it's the whole day with the

00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:57,100
night work you know or it's even two

00:51:53,740 --> 00:52:01,410
days so if we were to do another tough

00:51:57,100 --> 00:52:01,410
summit in the future should there be a

00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:10,240
yes maybe we can do it together maybe we

00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:12,670
can maybe we'll wait you're for our

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,970
hekkador maybe this year let's make it

00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:18,190
together attract a lot of interest and a

00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:20,260
lot of people were into the world of

00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:24,490
drones because of hackathon actually me

00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:27,640
for example so ask the audience here to

00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:31,900
raise your hand if you are interested in

00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:34,570
that portion to add up to a dozen we're

00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:36,850
waiting each of you we very much to make

00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:44,500
international hackathon next time so it

00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:46,600
would be really great next I just super

00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,310
quick question so how much did the drone

00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:52,540
gets cost and what are your plans for

00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:59,920
expansion internationally our drone it

00:52:52,540 --> 00:53:02,650
cost about $700 and yes we are planning

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,660
to expand and we are slowly expanding

00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:10,359
into Chinese market and Chile market to

00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:12,460
United Arab Emirates market for example

00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:17,410
there was an interesting project where

00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:22,210
students from ICANN Netherland take our

00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:25,690
drone and probably take a part in some

00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:31,390
competition I forget the name but it was

00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:34,540
very interesting for us all right so two

00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:40,090
questions first what's the flight time

00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:43,330
oh it's from 8 minutes to 12 or 15

00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:45,970
minutes it depends what how many of

00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:49,450
pilot on the drone alright quite long

00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:53,200
and which version of raspberry pi was

00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:57,450
used a model 3 plus 3 B plus so that's

00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:57,450
quite some computing power thank you

00:53:59,190 --> 00:54:05,020
have you looked into may be integrating

00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:07,540
with Microsoft make code or any kind of

00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:11,859
blockly language to make this relevant

00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:14,800
even younger users great this platform

00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:18,190
is very extensible so our students

00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,760
created a scratch addition to it we are

00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:24,010
thinking about adding this to the main

00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:26,170
platform maybe we add but now it can be

00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:28,570
installed but it's not so easy but it

00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:31,000
can be added because of extensible

00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:32,830
nature of Rods platform and our

00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:35,800
enterprise the communication platform

00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:37,540
platform so I saw that you have a lot of

00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,440
schools in Russia they are using it how

00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,430
do the school finance the the kids they

00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,090
financed by the government or is it

00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:49,869
single schools it depends mostly it's

00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:52,540
they you know school can buy it with the

00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:54,540
government money oh and they buy all

00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:58,869
that they have with government money and

00:54:54,540 --> 00:55:01,900
they buy our educational drum kit to

00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:04,510
learn some subjects for example and to

00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:08,590
take part in competition because who are

00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:11,650
interested in competitions in Russia how

00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:13,840
many money how many they have money is

00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:16,470
depends of results in competition of

00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,470
students too

00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:32,480
and for those $700 do you get or what do

00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:35,960
you get is the drone and yes you get the

00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,090
drone and all the parts of drone and for

00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:41,330
example if you stem educational center

00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:45,670
you have free educational courses for

00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:50,480
teachers then all our helpdesk our

00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:54,650
material our files - laser-cut you can

00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:56,810
just cut it in your lap and you don't

00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,910
need to buy them one more time to give

00:55:56,810 --> 00:56:02,540
the drone unassembled yes you get drawn

00:55:58,910 --> 00:56:04,790
an assemble and you have all and not

00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:07,160
only drone and tools - to assemble it

00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:10,790
and you know if you just take this box

00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:21,550
go I don't know in park assemble drone

00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:24,640
and data fly how many people do you have

00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:27,830
supporting your communities on the

00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,460
forums how many employees do you have to

00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:35,320
put into that job you know it I think

00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:39,560
it's over 15 people in our company it's

00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:42,770
people who worked in our educational

00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:45,770
part of company they organized the

00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:49,460
competition's contests they organized

00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:56,650
courses and they create an educational

00:56:49,460 --> 00:57:01,940
materials but you know community helps

00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:05,630
help themselves because when we start we

00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:08,990
help to every person but now they help

00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:11,660
each other and though we have not so

00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:14,750
many people to create this community

00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:17,660
and now it's really big because people

00:57:14,750 --> 00:57:19,790
want to help each other and want to

00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,980
share their knowledge and also it's not

00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:24,700
a forum it's just a chat so you can end

00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:27,830
this chat it's a public chat and

00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:30,470
everyone can answer yes but it's in

00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:32,570
Russian that in English no no there was

00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:36,730
were some questions in English yeah we

00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:36,730
can answer in English yes

00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:42,520
any other questions all right I have two

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,710
questions actually I see that you were

00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:48,070
trying drumkit and then Matt Robson Ross

00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:49,780
have you tried the map SDK actually when

00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:53,740
