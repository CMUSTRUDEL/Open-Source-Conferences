Publication date: 2020-07-06
Playlist: PX4 Developer Summit 2020 | Virtual
Description: 
	The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community.

An In-depth Look at the Multicopter Control System Architecture

This session takes a deep dive into the multicopter control system. The current controller architecture will be presented and explained. Block diagrams and the relevant sections in code of each individual controller will be given.

The aim is to provide sufficient information for new developers that would like to design a control system for a multicopter either by tuning the current PID gains, extending and/or modifying the current controllers. To do this, knowledge of the control system architecture is required. This session provides that information to empower developers.
