	Title: Our journey to achieve event-enabled autonomy (3-design choices)

Summary: We are an autonomous delivery startup based in The Netherlands.
We harness the power of the PX4 ecosystem along with cutting-edge Cloud solutions to enable Event-driven Autonomy for our drones. Simply put, it was hard (but super fun!).
Via this talk, we would like to distill and share our learnings in the form of 3 design choices (we call them as U-turns) which enables event-driven autonomy for our drones.

#1 Python and/or C++?
#2 When to 'Edge over Cloud'?
#3 When to 'Cloud over Edge'?

Net, our talk summarises best practices (our version) in the realization of a ‘forward-looking’ autonomous drone delivery architecture. See you soon!

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
