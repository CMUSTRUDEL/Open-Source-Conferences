	Title: Extending MAVSDK with new features

Presenter: Jonas Vautherin, Software Engineer @ Auterion

Summary: This session will explain how proto definitions and auto-generation can be leveraged to extend MAVSDK. Either by adding a MAVLink message to an existing plugin or by creating a new plugin completely. The demo will show that the logic has to be written only once in C++ and that it is then propagated to the language bindings through auto-generation. It will also explain that this is independent of MAVLink, and could be used to leverage other interfaces (e.g. a REST interface to a web server).

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
