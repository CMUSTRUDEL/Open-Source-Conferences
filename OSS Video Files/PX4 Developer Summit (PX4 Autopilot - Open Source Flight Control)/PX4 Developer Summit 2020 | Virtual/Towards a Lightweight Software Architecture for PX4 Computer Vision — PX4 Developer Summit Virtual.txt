	Title: Towards a Lightweight Software Architecture for PX4 Computer Vision

Summary: We present a powerful, yet lightweight, software architecture designed to run on an embedded companion computer alongside a PX4 flight controller. This architecture provides multi-modal computer vision functionality to PX4 such as Visual Obstacle Avoidance (VOA), an open-source Visual Inertial Odometry (VINS Fusion), Fiducial Marker Relocalization, and Object Tracking. We demonstrate the functionality of this architecture on a ModalAI PX4 development platform and present our roadmap for future development.
