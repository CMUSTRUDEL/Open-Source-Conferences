Description: 
	Title: Simulated Workflows using Software-In-The-Loop Simulations
Summary: Software-In-The-Loop simulations have been a great tool to speed up the development process for developers in the PX4 community.

In this session, we show how this approach can be used for testing advanced flight control features such as high-risk flight control features to multi-vehicle simulations. Also, we explore how this tool can be extended for testing complex interactions of vehicle subcomponents beyond the firmware using mavlink as an interface.
