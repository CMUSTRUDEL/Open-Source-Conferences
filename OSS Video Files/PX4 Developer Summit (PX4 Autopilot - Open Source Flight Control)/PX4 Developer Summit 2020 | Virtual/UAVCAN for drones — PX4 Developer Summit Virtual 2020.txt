hello I'm Pablo this is about you a

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,620
weekend here weekend is an acronym that

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:16,710
stands for uncomplicated application

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:19,650
level communication and networking we

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,050
started the project in 2014 as an

00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,900
attempt to create a modern real-time

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,180
communication protocol for new vehicular

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,680
systems that offer touch abstractions

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,630
while at the same time being

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,230
conceptually simple and easy to

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,920
implement we position here we can assign

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:39,090
means of implementing high integrity

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,190
real-time distributed reheat you are

00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,110
competing this is slightly different

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,030
from the conventional concept of a

00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:46,770
vehicle database the difference is

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,110
probably best described it through the

00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,289
levels of abstraction like this suppose

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,840
we put different communication solutions

00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:57,539
on table segregating them by their core

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,789
concepts like this the design focus here

00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,690
is the main factor considered by the

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:06,240
developer of the ecosystem so as a

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,250
baseline we take the simplest means of

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,290
communication that is the direct

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:11,909
physical connectivity between the

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,850
components within the vehicle to

00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,350
exchange either analog signals or they

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,530
are digitized with their presentations

00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:21,299
using dedicated cable harnesses digital

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,070
protocols typically also apply time

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,140
multiplexing here a database in this

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,549
case we are talking about a logical

00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,040
database regardless of its physical

00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,229
event organization typically offers a

00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,750
higher level abstraction where the

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,790
design is focuses on packets of

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,649
semantically related data as opposed to

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:46,560
just color signals the next and highest

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,509
level is the level of distributed

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,250
computing the design process at this

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,360
level is publishes not merely on

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,130
specific data packets or signals but on

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,380
higher level relations between the

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,180
components of the vehicular system the

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,799
technology is used to facilitate the

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,409
spirit of computing are often

00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:07,229
incompatible with the high degrees of

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,810
safety and determinism requires an

00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,899
critical

00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,940
applications abstraction is becoming

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,980
increasingly important today when they

00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:17,830
complexity of vehicular indulgence is

00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,340
increasing rapidly at the same time the

00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:24,099
safety standards are as hard as ever

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,170
here we can is our attempt at offering

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:28,780
rich abstractions that are familiar to

00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,930
software engineers at zero cost without

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,940
compromise on functional safety we

00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:36,280
achieve this by keeping the protocol

00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,250
very simple and published if you take

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:41,470
for example DDS art against a very rich

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,330
and complex protocol its implementation

00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,760
may take one hundred thousand lines of

00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,380
code or even more which would be

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,900
difficult to verify and validate it

00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,549
compared to the one or two thousand

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,739
lines of code needed to implement your

00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:56,260
vision obviously here again does not

00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:58,420
attempt to put itself directly against

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,989
such Parisian complex technologies like

00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,970
DDS they are not comparable they target

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:06,310
different applications at all but here

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,110
we can implement the subset of the

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:10,930
functionality that is the most relevant

00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:13,180
for the target applications to use great

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:15,700
the complexity of the protocol here is a

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,010
social media post from one of the

00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,390
adopters of the technology who claims to

00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:24,700
have implemented the particle from

00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:27,040
scratch in two weeks in weeks 2019 we

00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:30,069
decided to take a closer look at our

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,140
doctors and we run a survey among other

00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,850
things we confirmed that here again is

00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:35,799
being deployed in various types of

00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:39,160
vehicles including new projects of

00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,769
magnet electric aircraft spacecraft

00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,280
obviously drones which is the major

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:47,650
domain for us and general turbodiesel

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,989
about half of the respondents reported

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,720
interest in using you began with

00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,940
Ethernet as opposed to canvas this

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,489
confirming our hypothesis that you

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,470
became is relevant beyond can & Drums

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,139
the protocol is focusing on the

00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,970
distributed computing and communication

00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,739
requirements that are common for many

00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,700
diverse with into their applications in

00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:12,239
its draft revision code version 0 the

00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,720
protocol used to provide a specialized

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,450
application layer specification

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,549
optimized for drones it is no longer

00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:20,389
part of the particle this change caused

00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:22,939
much distress among the exist

00:04:20,389 --> 00:04:24,889
doctors but it's actually no reason for

00:04:22,939 --> 00:04:27,229
concern because the application layer

00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:29,180
specification is still there it is just

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:31,879
maintained by a different body

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:34,909
our good colleagues from the peaks for

00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:37,189
project are working on the year we can

00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:39,219
drawn standard which will provide a

00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:43,279
solid application layer specification

00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:44,930
tailored for unmanned vehicles we

00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,960
actually take part in the design process

00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,789
to ensure that the design follows solid

00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,120
engineering principles and it is

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:55,009
long-term viable other such application

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,860
standards may appear in the future

00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:59,779
independently we as you became

00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,120
maintainer actually prefer to distance

00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,759
ourselves from specifying applications

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,610
and focus instead only on the protocol

00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,770
itself the case of the drone standard

00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:12,469
might be here a slight exception here

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:15,409
because we won't ensure that the first

00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:18,199
such standard leverages the protocol

00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:21,199
correctly and is built according to the

00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:23,360
best practices particularly we want to

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,150
make sure that the users of year we can

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,009
adopt the proper mindset and we use the

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,180
protocol notice yet another with each

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:33,439
other bus interconnecting the various

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:35,360
with equal components with the main

00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,279
computer but a facilitator of

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,409
distributed intelligence where the

00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:43,279
network itself is and is an integral

00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:46,610
part of it to educate our adopters about

00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:48,409
best practices we made a comprehensive

00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:51,020
guide at the name of the year we can

00:05:48,409 --> 00:05:54,199
guide which is already available in my

00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:57,409
here if you design here we can systems

00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:59,599
please read it ok next I'm going to

00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,969
describe the current state of the year

00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:04,939
we can hardware ecosystem the technology

00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:07,669
is very new but there appear to be a

00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:09,770
bunch of randoms not only leverage the

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:11,839
protocol internally but manufacturer

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,789
became compatible commercial

00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:16,339
off-the-shelf hardware for example there

00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:19,939
is obviously the works robotics which am

00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:20,750
affiliated with and there is NXP

00:06:19,939 --> 00:06:22,969
Semiconductors

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:24,770
with their european compatible

00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:28,460
development kits and

00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:31,630
designs risk an open-source ESC project

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,770
with a variety of different hardware

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,900
implementations epic runs they

00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,389
manufacture an electronic fuel injection

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:42,250
system with here we can interface

00:06:38,389 --> 00:06:44,630
peligro manufacturer of eyelets and ESC

00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,300
there are here we can interface at

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,870
service from high tech and also throwing

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:54,199
in the flight battery management systems

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:59,900
from arc electronics various avionics

00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,729
from robotics including also the onboard

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,069
speaking of development boards in

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:06,590
particular they are important because

00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:08,690
they are use the entry barriers or

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,310
doctors building their own hardware at

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,430
the moment there are two major offerings

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:17,810
from my buttocks this one and also from

00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:20,300
an XP and there is also a very new

00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,240
project called Google can offer any

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:24,409
lubricant components or different

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,389
applications the point I'm trying to

00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:28,610
illustrate here it is that the echo

00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:31,190
system is growing rapidly by the weight

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,919
note that some of the products are based

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:35,300
on extremely resource constraints very

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,099
metal microcontrollers which is a

00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,560
testament to the simplicity argument I

00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:41,870
introduced the order your account can be

00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:46,639
operated in the microcontroller with

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:48,349
only 32 KH and maybe 8k of RAM the

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,969
future development of the technology

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,430
relies on external external

00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,930
contributions first things first if you

00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:57,319
can support here we can eventually

00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:59,270
consider donating here but a better way

00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,520
to contribute is to dedicate some

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,169
engineering work for the development of

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,389
the protocol games - like behind the

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,219
schedule sometimes bad which

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,909
occasionally causes concern among

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,490
adopters

00:08:07,909 --> 00:08:13,130
I would like to encourage more users to

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:16,789
submit patches and code because this is

00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:18,349
something we need help mostly one of the

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:20,960
most critical items that are still

00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:24,259
missing with the resource generation is

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,419
the new user interface we are building a

00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:28,250
complex and powerful graphical tool for

00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:30,440
developing debugging and maintaining

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,779
here we can base the Hickory systems and

00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,530
the project needs computers mostly

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,730
front-end

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,700
the tool is built on the conventional

00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:41,620
website the mechanism Python and the

00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,390
front-end is based on here please

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,730
coordinate with us through the forum

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:48,100
even though the graphical user trip is

00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:50,680
not available it is possible to use this

00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,170
common line repeats this example we

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,630
define the basic data type point XY

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,640
which contains just two fields and we

00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:03,610
include it into another custom data type

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:08,130
the catenary of points we generate the

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:11,800
code from this dfdl definitions and

00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:16,810
generate the standard definitions and

00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:20,190
afterwards we launch a subscriber using

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:23,560
the topic number one two three four

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:27,310
using this new data type over the UDP

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:30,040
transport and then likewise in a similar

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:35,260
manner we launch publisher also over the

00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:38,410
UDP transport using this young field

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:41,140
specification format here it is with

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,520
awkward to use but it doesn't require a

00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,690
graphical user interface and that's

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,690
advantage of this method

00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:03,060
or English okay and we get three three

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,040
messages published that's it

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,620
the last thing I want to say is that if

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,930
you're an adopter please give us a shout

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,270
out on the forum we would like to know

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:17,180
our users and where and how they use

00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,180
