Title: The BVLOS future of drone software and industry standardization â€” PX4 Developer Summit 2020
Publication date: 2020-07-15
Playlist: PX4 Developer Summit 2020 | Virtual
Description: 
	Title: The BVLOS future of drone software and industry standardization

Summary: James will present on the dramatic changes occurring in the drone software landscape as the commercial drone industry moves towards Beyond Line of Sight operations and begins to adopt safety and design standards. Specifically, James will address the recent ASTM Standard Specification for Detect and Avoid Performance Requirements* and Software Dependability requirements which governs the performance and functional characteristics of drone operations equipped with autonomous detect and avoid, critical for enabling the expansion of drone operations to the Beyond Line of Sight realm.

In the presentation James will cover detailed examples of the changes needed in different parts of the PX4 drone software ecosystem (specifically QGroundControl and PX4 Autopilot Firmware) related to some of the ASTM standard requirements and begin a conversation around how the PX4 community and the wider open source drone software community can begin to adopt these standards in its continued development and improvement.

* ASTM WK62668 (https://www.astm.org/DATABASE.CART/WORKITEMS/WK62668.htm) is anticipated to publish in June 2020 a definition for the minimum performance standards for DAA systems applicable to smaller UAS BLVOS operations for the protection of manned aircraft in lower altitude airspace.

hey everyone I'm back next up is the

00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,050
beyond visual line of sight feature of

00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,590
drone software and industry civilization

00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,990
by James Howard founder of CTO of IIRIRA

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,760
solid nation and we're going back to San

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,210
Francisco California to connect with

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,789
them but before I connect to you how are

00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:28,890
you all doing

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:32,880
are you tired I am a little bit tired

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:35,070
I've been awake since a couple of hours

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,040
now I don't even have a sense of time

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:40,920
what time is it I still have some energy

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,530
for a few more sessions don't forget to

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,289
ask questions from Chad John doesn't

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,120
slack follow us on social media you also

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,559
want to quickly remind you that there's

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,329
an after party scheduled for until

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:58,920
tomorrow and the link is only going out

00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:01,010
by slack so please join us it's gonna be

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,840
fun if that's tomorrow at 3 p.m. Pacific

00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,850
more details on slack again so let me

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,280
connect you back to James in California

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,460
give you one brief minute and he's all

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,460
yours

00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:20,460
James can you do me a quick favor

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,540
let's do a quick audio check yep hello a

00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:23,540
test one two three

00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:32,729
awesome I think I can hear you well if I

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:35,850
bring confirmation he doesn't give me

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,680
one second I think we're good to go

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:40,619
how's everyone doing yes we're good to

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,280
go all right guys this is the peaks for

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:47,189
this summit live from Tijuana

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,229
next up James Howard from higher cell

00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:50,880
donation speaking about the beyond Lisa

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,670
visual line of sight feature and

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:56,549
standard option it's up to you James

00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:59,579
thank you thanks very much for one and

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,009
hi everybody I hope you're having a good

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,469
time at the summit and thank you for

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,270
joining my presentation today I'll be

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,910
going over beyond visual line of sight

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,989
and how we can get there through

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:11,989
standards adoption

00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,340
ground on myself

00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,830
as we begin I am the co-founder and VP

00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,390
engineering at iris automation my

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,990
background is in mechatronics

00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:30,320
engineering Space Systems and unmanned

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,660
aircraft systems at iris automation we

00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,780
develop in cassia system which is an

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,510
onboard detect and avoid technology that

00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,360
leverages computer vision and artificial

00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:45,580
intelligence to enable autonomy and

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,580
increase safety within the airspace

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,030
today I'll be going over the on visual

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,370
line of sight and how that is achieved

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:56,709
practically at the at the moment as well

00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,830
as a discussion of the future of beyond

00:02:56,709 --> 00:03:01,750
visual line of sight drone operation an

00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,629
overview of the standards that are being

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:09,610
developed and released for UAS that are

00:03:04,629 --> 00:03:11,739
related to that and where I see the px4

00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,670
and open-source communities can continue

00:03:11,739 --> 00:03:18,970
their leadership in that space hopefully

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:22,329
the outcomes today are an introduction

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,040
to what regulators are thinking of when

00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:27,370
assessing beyond visual line of sight

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:29,140
operation hopefully I can also spark

00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:31,480
some ideas for you or give you insights

00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,269
into how to operate drones beyond line

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,640
of sight and really pick up a

00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:40,000
conversation and collaboration amongst

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,640
the open-source community in enabling

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,230
people who use the technology the

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,680
open-source technology to fly the on

00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,680
line of sight

00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,099
so a background on BB us it's really the

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,370
dream that everybody has had for drones

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:59,219
from the very beginning thinking of the

00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:02,219
Jetsons and flying cars and package

00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:03,510
delivery fully autonomously is really

00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:07,109
where I think a lot of the industry

00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:09,239
wants to get to and BV loss operations

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:12,659
for drones is really the first step to

00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,930
full autonomy within airspace but within

00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:19,079
the airspace and just aviation as a

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:21,900
whole the on visual line of sight

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,500
operation implies either no operator or

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,759
a remote operator with very limited

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,770
situational awareness about what is

00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,169
happening where the gern is flying and

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,720
that produces concerns from civil

00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:36,840
aviation authorities about airspace

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,520
integration their job is to maintain and

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,380
improve safety of the airspace and so

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,620
introduction of autonomous systems and

00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:47,639
needs to be done in a careful manner so

00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,550
as not to impact that safety as many of

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,050
you are probably aware beaver loss is

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,169
fundamentally required for many

00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,780
different industries and applications

00:04:54,169 --> 00:05:00,360
including touch and rescue scaleable

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,930
linear infrastructure inspection package

00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,050
delivery

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:06,330
land and resource management and then a

00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:09,080
mobility which is the fancy name for

00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,080
flying taxis

00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:15,710
give you an idea of what the challenges

00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:18,620
are well the number one is safety like I

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:20,720
mentioned and I wanted to share with you

00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:23,300
what this looks like from a practical

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,240
perspective so this is an image that was

00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,970
captured from a drone with our detect

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,340
and avoid system on board and you can

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:33,500
see that we've made a detection of

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,470
someone in the airspace around the drug

00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,620
and decided to take an avoid of maneuver

00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:42,889
so as to keep that airspace user safe

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:46,160
and this is really this is what it looks

00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:49,250
like zoomed in what we came across was a

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,830
paraglider they're a very small aircraft

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,580
they entered the airspace completely

00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:56,720
unannounced

00:05:52,580 --> 00:06:00,560
they have no radio no ATSB no engine

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,680
noise to cue a human operator and

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,930
they're flying at low altitude and this

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,630
is what governments and regular

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:10,400
regulators are concerned about is with

00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:14,120
the introduction of drones into the

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,940
airspace existing users like this could

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,940
be severely impacted and we want to

00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,210
prevent that from happening so detect

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,760
and avoid is is one way there and it's

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,150
good to know that beyond visual line of

00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:31,400
sight is actually achievable it's not

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:34,010
completely walled off we've seen in the

00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:38,360
United States a increase in approvals

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:40,520
for 107 31 waivers which is the waiver

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,889
from the requirement for a visual

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,169
observer increasing over the recent

00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:48,530
years and using the appropriate safety

00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:51,199
technology BT loss is achievable today

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,360
but as we'll talk about the future will

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,360
be much similar the process through the

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,470
adoption of standards currently

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,570
different countries have different

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,860
processes but what the commonalities are

00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,130
operations within low to moderate risk

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,159
airspace using an onboard real-time

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,680
detected wide system and adopting a

00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:15,320
systems and operations approach to risk

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,930
analysis usually through the Soraa

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,849
process the standardized operational

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,539
risk assessment that was developed by

00:07:19,849 --> 00:07:22,539
Joris

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:28,660
so the future of DV loss is really to

00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:31,980
make this process a lot easier now make

00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:34,450
it a standardized process where

00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:38,410
standards for hardware software systems

00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:41,280
and procedures are adopted and where the

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:44,350
industry can move from permission to

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,050
regulation the difference in language

00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:49,900
there is that permissions are exceptions

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,850
to an existing rule to allow you to do

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,740
something outside of that rule whereas

00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,750
the regulation would be a standardized

00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,490
rule set where if you meet the

00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,400
requirements of that regulation you can

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:03,460
operate without permission just by

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,500
default and so the future of the

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,890
industry is to move the unoriginal

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:12,130
line-of-sight to a standardized

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:16,510
regulation where yarns and freely

00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:17,590
operate within that regulation and it's

00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,740
going to take a lot of industry

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:22,840
cooperation to get there right now many

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:24,790
drones are built in a piecewise approach

00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,370
there are many different components are

00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,350
sourced from many different vendors and

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:32,760
quite often the operator is the

00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:36,150
integrator and there's a lot of overhead

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,220
required under the under that paradigm

00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,890
for the integrator to do analysis and

00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:44,530
testing and verification to prove to the

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:46,000
regulator that their system is safe for

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,810
beyond visual line of sight operation

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,290
and so as standards are adopted and as

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:58,600
systems are built that becomes an easier

00:08:53,290 --> 00:09:01,500
process so the future of beyond visual

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,390
line of sight will require or include

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:08,320
regulatory certification of complete

00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:11,830
drone systems as well as subsystems to

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,320
those drones ways that that can be

00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:17,140
achieved through the technical standards

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,500
order process that exists today as well

00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,120
as compliance and product testing for

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,430
new standards that are being developed

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,700
and we'll talk about some of the ones

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:30,220
coming out of ASTM in a moment as well

00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,780
as type certification of unmanned

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,060
aircraft systems which is something that

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,760
has really come about in the United

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:40,140
States recently and many

00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,720
pennies are moving towards that

00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:44,400
so at the end of the day what it boils

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,910
down to is that systems that meet

00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:51,510
standards receive a higher trust and

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:55,410
face a simpler approval process from

00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:57,720
regulators around the world and as we

00:09:55,410 --> 00:10:00,600
build more and more systems to standards

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,760
that trust builds and will set the

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,560
future of where this industry goes so

00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,920
the goal at the end of the day is a

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,790
repeatable standards procedure to fly

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,790
fully autonomous aircraft

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:17,470
quick introduction to some of these

00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,839
standards so who is defining them right

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:24,459
now at least in the United States that

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,920
is primarily ASTM and rtca both

00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:29,499
organizations have had a history in the

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,100
aviation industry for defining standards

00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:35,860
and they have taken different approaches

00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,610
where ASTM is focused primarily on small

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:43,629
UAS and rtca on larger UAS and today

00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:46,059
we'll talk about ASTM and just for

00:10:43,629 --> 00:10:47,800
background in the United States and in

00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:51,429
many other countries around the world a

00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:55,949
small UAS is one that is less than 55

00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:55,949
pounds or 25 kilograms in mass

00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,689
it's also worth noting some of the

00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,600
existing standards for aviation and

00:11:00,689 --> 00:11:07,279
avionics and where they fit in so the

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:12,149
common ones that are referenced are 178

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:15,299
256 and 160 currently we're seeing that

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,169
the need for those is really when people

00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:21,359
are on board the aircraft and that

00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:24,540
they're not currently being applied to

00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:26,850
small UAS operating in low to moderate

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,589
risk aspects especially with the

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,619
adoption of these newer standards that

00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:34,139
we'll talk about and I guess lastly how

00:11:31,619 --> 00:11:37,319
do we know what will be adopted and

00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:39,029
which standards matter in our experience

00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:41,579
at IRS automation it comes from direct

00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,739
feedback from global regulators we work

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:47,669
with customers in the United States

00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:50,790
Canada across Europe in South America

00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:53,819
Australasia and many other countries

00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:54,929
around the world and we amalgamate a lot

00:11:53,819 --> 00:11:57,059
of feedback from these different

00:11:54,929 --> 00:11:58,829
regulators as they're assessing the

00:11:57,059 --> 00:12:00,899
programs that our customers are involved

00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:03,100
with and it gives us insight into what's

00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:06,560
coming next

00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:09,670
so looking at ASTM where we are

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:15,110
expecting that the FAA is going to adopt

00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:18,260
in 2020 and 2021 to standards both from

00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:20,810
ASTM one is the UAS software

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:23,840
dependability standard which covers a

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:28,130
lot of software development procedures

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,580
test procedures validation procedures

00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:35,120
and a lot of organizational and process

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,100
structures the other is the detect and

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,680
avoid minimum operating performance

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:41,480
standard and that's really what I'm

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,280
going to focus on on this talk because

00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,130
it covers a lot more of the

00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:49,190
functionality of the drone and the

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:52,940
safety and performance within the

00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:57,860
airspace so a bit more technical as

00:12:52,940 --> 00:13:00,400
opposed to organizational that standard

00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:03,950
covers the detection avoid system as

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:06,710
well as its integration into the UAS

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,920
system which is the autopilot and the

00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:13,730
airframe and the performance of that

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,130
aircraft and it also covers the ground

00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:19,010
station integration as well as human

00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:21,320
factors in remote operation using a

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:25,940
detection of loyd system so it's quite a

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:28,760
holistic look at the full system beyond

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:31,310
just the detect and avoid itself it's

00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,310
how does that detect and avoid enable

00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,320
this drone to function autonomously and

00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:37,650
at the end of the day beyond visual line

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,100
of sight

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:44,850
it really touches px4 mavs link and cue

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,260
ground control as well as cassia at

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,130
detecting the blade system and how they

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:52,390
work together

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:55,180
so who is impacted at the end of the day

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:57,950
it comes down to the DAA

00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,200
detecting a void system manufacturer the

00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:02,300
iris automation is is one of such

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,390
manufacturers as well as the

00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:09,240
manufacturer of the UAS the integrator

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:14,850
of the UAS and the operator of the UAS

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:18,450
and really the reasons to adopt this

00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:20,940
standard and to think ahead of where the

00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:24,779
regulator's are in their requirements

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:28,830
today is that by having technology that

00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:31,220
is compliant to a standard it's enabling

00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:34,470
for everyone within the industry

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,410
standards provide a simpler path for a

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:39,690
customer or for an operator to go from

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:42,750
procurement to operating beyond a visual

00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,930
line of sight and that really helps the

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:49,350
entire industry grow and build trust

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:52,560
between what we're developing today and

00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:55,320
the regulator's who are approving its

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,740
operation within a space of their

00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,740
countries

00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:04,420
the px4 and open source can really lead

00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,420
in this regard

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,680
px4 as well as other Eric and sauce

00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:13,490
software's are already global leaders

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,500
within the UAS market and so it's we're

00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:19,310
already in a great position here where

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,310
that leadership can be maintained into

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,410
the future

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,360
that

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,569
I mentioned at the beginning of of this

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,940
talk that the different working groups

00:15:28,569 --> 00:15:34,420
and communities that are contributing to

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,240
these pieces of software and to this

00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:39,190
technology need to begin starting or

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,899
having conversations that include

00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,990
standards within those conversations

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:46,269
that it's more than the functionality of

00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:51,550
the software that needs to be assessed

00:15:46,269 --> 00:15:56,589
but also how that software affects the

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:59,500
end user and their application an open

00:15:56,589 --> 00:16:02,649
source to me is really all about change

00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,269
and collaboration and continuing that

00:16:02,649 --> 00:16:07,060
collaboration and continuing to work

00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:09,610
together collectively is going to be

00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,629
what's needed to make this shift towards

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:12,629
standardization happen

00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:19,220
so I'd like to see the community

00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,440
leverage the existing collaborative

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:24,290
approach and in the adoption of new

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,300
standards the drone code is a really

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,750
good facilitator of that especially

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:33,709
between industry and open source and the

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:36,290
forums of course github slack the other

00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:39,140
different channels that open source has

00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,149
this community of open source computer

00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,440
contributors has to continue that

00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,779
discussion and continue collaborating

00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,910
with one another and with industry who

00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,740
are implementing these pieces of

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:49,970
software and technology into the

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,149
airspace that working with the

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:56,570
regulators directly and like I mentioned

00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:58,490
taking a systems level approach so one

00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:00,980
example that I'll go into a minute is

00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,950
that a change to the ground control

00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,990
station could actually affect the

00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:08,929
compliance to a complete system because

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,089
these regulators around the world are

00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:14,000
taking a systems level approach to risk

00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:16,120
analysis so they're not just looking at

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,339
the autopilot or just looking at the

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:22,220
drone airframe itself but how that

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:27,230
entire system works within their

00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:29,720
airspace so looking at the ASTM detect

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:32,210
and avoid minimum operating performance

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:35,660
standards specifically there are a few

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:40,330
gaps within the Q ground control P h4

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:44,120
and MAV link that we have identified and

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,880
those are the requirement for continuous

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,540
alerting for detected failures to the

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:53,660
remote operator so a temporary alert or

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:56,360
a pop-up is is not adequate to meet the

00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:00,700
requirements in the standard it needs to

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,919
persist until that failure is rectified

00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:09,200
additionally adoption of advisory

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:12,080
secular 25.1 three - two - one which is

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,900
a bit of a mouthful but in the United

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,640
States anyway it defines colors and

00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,429
terminology that should be used for

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,929
alerts to a human operator of an

00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:26,270
aircraft and currently the alerts and

00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:27,260
cue ground control are a single color I

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,570
always

00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:32,560
the same there are specific requirements

00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,290
in the United States for human factors

00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:40,160
interaction between avionics systems and

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:42,710
the operator lastly for hugh grant

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,330
control the standard specifies that

00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:46,430
there must be visual awareness of any

00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:49,340
suppressed functions that could impact

00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:54,950
safety so one of those is the auditory

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:56,270
alerts that can be generated from alerts

00:18:54,950 --> 00:19:00,680
that come in to the ground station that

00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:03,860
text-to-speech engine in px4 via the

00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:06,260
requirement for payloads such as detect

00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,660
and avoid systems to be able to talk

00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,510
directly to the ground control station

00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:15,320
via the command and control link is a

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:18,410
requirement and this is something that I

00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:22,790
think is is functional in some cases but

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:26,000
not necessarily all and then lastly the

00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:28,280
standard defines geospatial alerts where

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,740
the remote operator can essentially be

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,910
shown where a potential collision might

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,590
happen as well as you know when that

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,790
might happen

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:41,500
showing it on the map showing it with

00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:43,670
velocity vectors of the of the intruders

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:47,480
certain requirements like that are set

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:49,340
out that being said the software has

00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,460
already been designed extremely well few

00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:53,690
ground control and px4 follow great

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,040
design standards and there are many

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,390
parts of the requirement that are

00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:01,100
already met by the systems today they're

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,380
having alerts that are visual to the

00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:08,720
operator is is required something that

00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:11,090
pops up that shows the operator hey this

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,920
thing is happening as well as the

00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,690
requirement for active dismissal of

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,940
those alerts so that they won't just go

00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,940
away after five seconds and the operator

00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:22,280
is left wondering what what what just

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,100
happened I missed that the requirement

00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:28,700
to click the X button and actively

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,360
dismiss that alert is already

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,490
implemented

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,770
and then lastly the text-to-speech

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:37,890
engine already being implemented is

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:40,290
another requirement as well that's

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,540
covered through the standard as well as

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:46,080
the Advisory circular for being able to

00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,490
notify an operator you know maybe

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,440
they're not looking at the map at the

00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,010
time maybe they're referencing their

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:57,660
operating procedures manual and they

00:20:53,010 --> 00:21:00,300
need that auditory input and then in px4

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,280
autopilot we see that the peripheral

00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,110
device heartbeat monitoring as well as

00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,610
failsafe action already being

00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:09,810
implemented as a key part of that

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:12,750
standard where the the aircraft itself

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:15,420
is able to detect as well as react to

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,210
potential failures of subsystems and

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:19,590
safety systems that are required for

00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:23,730
that beyond visual line of sight

00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:27,270
operation so the most important of those

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:28,830
that is required from global regulators

00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:31,200
is the detect of the void system and

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,100
then there are other systems as well

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,530
such as ATS B or Flom or UTM input that

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,300
are maybe required under certain

00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,370
jurisdictions and being able to detect

00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,800
failures of those subsystems is

00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:47,460
extremely important and already

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,160
implemented within px4 and then along

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,320
with that they generated alert to the

00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,760
ground control station about that failed

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:59,330
periphery

00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:01,890
so we see that cue ground patrol px4

00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:03,360
already has quite a few of the features

00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,910
that these standards are starting to

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,550
talk about and will be required in the

00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,280
future and some new features and

00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:14,730
adjustments to the way things are done

00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:17,540
as examples for what this specific

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,910
standard is talking about

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,340
so in summary beyond visual line of

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,380
sight today is really a stepping stone

00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,750
to what it will be in the future where

00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,300
we are operating in a world where

00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:33,750
Commission is required to operate beyond

00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:35,390
visual line of sight and the goal and

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:38,790
the eventual outcome is to see

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,260
repeatable standard regulation so that

00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,200
beyond visual line of sight can be

00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:45,300
conducted by default if you meet the

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,280
requirements of that regulation in the

00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:49,170
same way that a pilot is able to go and

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,240
fly their plane whenever they please

00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:53,400
because they meet the requirements of

00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,780
the existing regulation and that's where

00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,080
we want to see the drone industry

00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:58,980
getting with beyond visual and sight and

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,130
the way to get there is through

00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:04,370
standards adoption and building trust

00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,720
with the with the regulating bodies and

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:08,880
px4 and open-source communities can

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:14,250
continue leading as they already have to

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:15,960
date and really I'm excited to move on

00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:19,590
from this presentation and hopefully

00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,050
continue a conversation with myself and

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,930
iris automation and other companies with

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:28,110
the open-source community and start

00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:30,900
building out the technology to meet the

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:33,270
safety requirements and meet the input

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:37,920
that the regulators are having and want

00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:40,560
to see from the community so thank you

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:44,250
very much for joining the talk I hope

00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:46,140
this was a good overview of a little

00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:50,670
introduction to regulation I think

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:54,600
there's a lot more to say and I want to

00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:56,780
continue that conversation now and into

00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,780
the future

00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,520
James can you hear me

00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,620
I can thank you this is removed from

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,740
crumb coat thanks for that awesome

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,870
presentation Wow what a way to end the

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:13,330
day you're right

00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,880
the standard adoption is the key across

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,560
the industry and we're glad that you

00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:20,710
touched on this point because that's

00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,320
what drone code is trying to do and we

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:25,630
want to invite everyone that is

00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,670
listening right now if you want to join

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,470
us and start talking about regulation

00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:31,510
and standards this is the perfect time

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,120
to do it there's momentum we're here

00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:37,240
we're waiting and there's no better time

00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:39,880
to do it than now thank you James

00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:42,040
if you would do me a favor can you join

00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,540
us briefly unlock there's a few

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,560
questions that would be also if you can

00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:48,520
join us there for a short Q&A session

00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,950
unfortunately we're out of time on our

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,360
live stream but I really want to thank

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,750
you and iris Automation for all the

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,940
effort that you did to be here today

00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,980
yeah thank you very much I'm glad to be

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:02,200
able to contribute and share our

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,330
knowledge I will definitely move over to

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,730
slack now to answer some of those

00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:11,340
questions so that's good talk to you

00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,340
