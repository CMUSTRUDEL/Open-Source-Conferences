	Title: An SoC-independent and open platform aims to help to standardize high-performance AI-enabled drones

Summary: With the increasing demand for computing capability, low power systems, flexible I/O as well as a mature software platform, the next generation of drones are calling for much more powerful silicon as well as differentiation these have to offer. Recently the largest cross silicon platform open standard organization, 96Boards, has joined forces with Dronecode to define the standard for high-performance drones. With its long list of silicon members and manufacturing partners worldwide, 96Boards brings high-performance silicon in a standardized approach to establish a generic hardware platform for drones.

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
