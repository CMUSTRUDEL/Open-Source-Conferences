Description: 
	Title: An SoC-independent and open platform aims to help to standardize high-performance AI-enabled drones

Summary: With the increasing demand for computing capability, low power systems, flexible I/O as well as a mature software platform, the next generation of drones are calling for much more powerful silicon as well as differentiation these have to offer. Recently the largest cross silicon platform open standard organization, 96Boards, has joined forces with Dronecode to define the standard for high-performance drones. With its long list of silicon members and manufacturing partners worldwide, 96Boards brings high-performance silicon in a standardized approach to establish a generic hardware platform for drones.

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd

everyone we're back thank you for being

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,360
here with the px4 developer summit day -

00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:11,429
we got dr. Yantz sang from 96 Ward's

00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:13,799
presenting an SOC independent an open

00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,080
platform aims to help to standardize

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,600
hate / high performance AI naval drums

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,910
dr. yang is going from cambric UK he's

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,699
the director of 96 ports hi chief

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,369
scientist in AI and board member at the

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,720
auto wear foundation 96 sports is well

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:29,189
respected within the industry for

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,380
providing analogy you know they're

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:32,489
innovative and flexible solutions it

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,110
provides a range of hardware

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,790
specifications created by linking our

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,040
own to make the latest art based

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,149
processors available to developers at a

00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,190
reasonable cost

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:42,660
96 sports just joined wrong code as a

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,239
gold member and we collaborate with

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,739
drunk code on open standards adoption 96

00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,480
ports plans to incorporate different

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,010
components of the pix works hardware

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,920
standards in part of mezzanine products

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,750
and new specifications next year for dr.

00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,800
yang let's see what 96 ports has

00:00:54,750 --> 00:01:01,559
installed for the community dr. yang

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,979
thank you for being here it was thank

00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,100
you for having me and hi everyone and

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:11,130
I'm you know glad to be here have the

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,710
opportunity to explain what we do why we

00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:16,850
joined drone code and what we're

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,850
planning to contribute to this amazing

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:25,140
dynamic community so my name is young I

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:31,380
will be presenting my screen shortly as

00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:34,110
we know okay so um so I will briefly

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,210
this paper would be two parts of the

00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,460
presentation first part I will give a

00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:43,229
brief introduction as brief as I can be

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,990
about who we are what we do then the

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,810
second part we would like to spend a bit

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:52,710
more time in talking about what we have

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:56,700
been doing so far trying to adopt the

00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:00,869
pixel standard as well as to enable the

00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,869
high performance Jon platform as we see

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:08,310
there is a growing need to fold that in

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:14,319
the market not only yeah give me one

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:21,590
second I'm just gonna me

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:25,340
you see there now okay great okay so 96

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:28,489
ports is the only SOC independent open

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,099
platform specification well we have is

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:32,989
with developer a range of open platform

00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:36,590
specification with all the entities for

00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:39,799
members and to open up for the entire

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,170
developer community worldwide to choose

00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:44,180
to use today we have probably over a

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,090
hundred different type of 96 port all

00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:50,329
build with the latest and greatest SSA

00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,220
from multiple all the major major SOC

00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:55,419
renders including thermostat us start

00:02:52,220 --> 00:03:00,290
our silicon windows all around the world

00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:02,329
so what we have is a bunch of company

00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,239
who are joined together very similar to

00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:08,689
John coach s 96 moment but it will also

00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,189
have a large you know partners

00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:12,379
partnership companies all around the

00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:14,079
world over hundred of them who doing

00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:17,299
different scenes we're imagining

00:03:14,079 --> 00:03:21,799
products developing software service OS

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:24,799
windows etc we have been leading some of

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:28,370
the technology frontier in open source

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,120
community as many as well probably sure

00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:35,889
you know soon see we cover a range of

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,229
the segment market on consumer mobility

00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:45,530
enterprise computing IOT device smart TV

00:03:39,229 --> 00:03:47,150
smart a networking automotive and AI so

00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:51,829
what we will show a little bit later in

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:54,319
terms of what are the main cross points

00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,810
if you like for what we're trying to do

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,959
with John community and we join code in

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,090
particular so why it's nineteen sport a

00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,799
CSR open platforms implication which we

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,009
have to borrow you can find from our web

00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,519
sites and it is designed all of them are

00:04:07,009 --> 00:04:12,229
designed with across SOC in mind which

00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,540
means it can support multiple different

00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:18,440
sources has been tailored for different

00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,000
segment markets from this from a

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,849
specification point of view I should add

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,080
it is well supported by the wider the

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:28,210
narrow members and also the ecosystem

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,310
and it is today the chosen reference

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:34,780
Taiwan by many open-source project which

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:37,780
I will give some of examples for for you

00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,360
and you can take a look and take that in

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:43,030
their way and take a look at a meaning

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,770
of the platforms and which I hope today

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:49,210
many of the platforms you have been

00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:52,270
using today are actually wrong the wrong

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:55,449
a 19-6 boats out there so nice was 96

00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:58,389
base for so we're for universal air

00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:59,860
support we will fold the SOC independent

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:02,169
platform to support the rapid

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:04,719
prototyping a single development

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:06,789
development community and the beautiful

00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:10,060
productions that is wrong keys in which

00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:13,300
we have is a people we believe people

00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,280
who would most benefit from a nice

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,520
expose it's not only building a hobby

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,830
project for ourselves but actually have

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,819
have an idea have a product comes out in

00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,599
mind where you want to build full-scale

00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:27,599
so this is

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,590
some of the project I just mentioned

00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:35,450
which have been using many known not

00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:38,060
only one but multiple ninety-six board

00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:40,340
as you can see Peaks force here and in

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:44,300
fact him we have a had a summer very

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,160
successful maddening John mezzanine

00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,540
products from existing Tennessee's poor

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,650
partner before we should join forces

00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:54,080
Joan coat so this list continue I won't

00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:57,920
spend some key work on this by the slide

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,930
is I have uploaded at and if you want to

00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,130
take a look and let me know if there's

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,280
anything particularly interesting you

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:06,440
have DC you will continue to see the

00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:11,140
cows many anger from the blockchain to

00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:15,290
security to the 3d gaming to real time

00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:21,470
real time kernel and of course of an OS

00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:22,970
distribution as well the other thing is

00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,190
that we do work with multiple different

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,560
cloud window as well addressing the

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,050
clock and included starting actually

00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:34,070
it's not difficult or funny if we found

00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:36,710
many of the clouds launch events on the

00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:39,980
device and most of them nationally

00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:42,890
having a nice explore their way so this

00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,340
is just to give you a glimpse of what we

00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:48,130
do on specific a on the I said is a call

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,990
96 pose instead of the open platform

00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:52,850
substation right I wish is the one with

00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:56,510
the core area which we will be working

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:58,520
together with John coach so today we

00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,010
have main in consumer Enterprise and

00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,570
Aunty Edition which these three are most

00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:04,250
of why they're being adopted already

00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,890
because actually those were the first

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:10,690
three sets which we give back the

00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:12,830
support all right a wide range of SLC's

00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,560
you know which will probably see the

00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,650
names very soon and of course we have

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:23,169
been developing anything for automotive

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:29,979
platforms for large-scale food

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:32,499
ATVs and vehicles accessory and we got

00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:35,009
some backgrounds background audio here

00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:37,689
that's normal

00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:41,050
last year we have launched a 296 people

00:07:37,689 --> 00:07:42,279
song which is system or module a special

00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:44,310
occasion as well which has been quickly

00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:46,629
adopted by many silicon vendors today

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:48,909
that's this is actually warm the most

00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:51,460
popular are popular a specification

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:54,279
which also wrote out the bill to the

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,960
sophistication has been requested by the

00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:57,960
professional and the price developers

00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:05,560
now this is more important this slide

00:08:01,779 --> 00:08:08,819
actually need to be updating so as I

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,110
said 96 post consists of a large list of

00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:13,840
stream committee members which included

00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:15,339
many silicon members I do apologize

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,520
because some of the icons need to be

00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:20,500
changing but those let's give you an

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:23,770
idea who actually are the string

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:26,349
committee members who join us developing

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,930
those fenders of course we would section

00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:30,219
in the updater which we have John Cody

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,349
as well because John Connor has

00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:36,579
officially joined 96 poor as well

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,130
manufacturer part of this is owning a

00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:42,550
selection of those which we have pretty

00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,410
much in every continent I'm not sure

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:47,440
about every country but so we have in

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:51,640
many many places who working on in their

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:54,519
specific fact a sector of the choice so

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,920
this so what are the real products built

00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:59,140
to the specification I think this would

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,800
give you a good idea what they look like

00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:04,510
so as I said the first of 319

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,180
specification a car was consumer

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,040
enterprise and IOT and this would be

00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,279
would look like well what is interesting

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,250
is today we have over hundred of 96 port

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,920
features way different you know a long

00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:20,730
range of silicon and most of them those

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,959
our latest equation silicon ok the notes

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:27,310
10 years old say silicones and they are

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,470
actually one thing which we see today is

00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:33,250
the many income they choose to launch

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:36,390
the product almond is export and I mean

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:38,160
silicon product so each of those

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,250
many of those polled actually looks very

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,089
similar and so you can probably see

00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,910
because they follow the same

00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,980
specifications which is known as Expo

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,480
specification however what is

00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,430
interesting is even though they look

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,990
very similar but none of and you know

00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:57,630
none of them actually exactly the same

00:09:51,990 --> 00:10:00,630
so that is one of the key you know

00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:04,170
philosophy if you want what we hold is

00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,089
that well we draw the line between voice

00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:09,089
doesn't make sense for why we worry to

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:10,800
reinvent the wheel but what well well we

00:10:09,089 --> 00:10:12,600
want to see differentiation where we

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,540
want to see people building it

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,640
differently I from the you know from the

00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:20,100
IP in the silicon himself which you

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,560
actually end product so that's what key

00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,329
to key words we hope that people take

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,850
away from this presentation a nice

00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:30,510
export is about standardization and

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,399
differentiation we standardize the part

00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:34,440
well nope does not make sense for

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
anybody to Riemann that we have to do it

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,890
twice but join together do it won't do

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:42,750
well a plug-and-play yet we do encourage

00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,760
people to highlight to focus their

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,980
investment in time in building those

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,279
bits either from the silicon wires from

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:53,160
the hardware from software pieces well

00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:57,140
they can actually gain differentiation

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,970
value which render to the hopefully the

00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:04,380
what they were gain by using the

00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:07,100
extended so form factor wise we have 96

00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,449
post and extension and price tender

00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:13,320
extensionality extend a standard

00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:14,730
extension this is a closer look like if

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,730
you look at all these names you can

00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:19,350
easily find on the web Google 19 sport

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,350
website these features different

00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:24,750
silicon's Franz Onix calm eye silicon

00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:28,829
and chicken action Simon rock chip and

00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:31,620
XP big man which is actually our so you

00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:34,620
can stock up on the a bit coincide in

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:37,519
Chau and Quoc home this is not

00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,230
completely as I said please give you a

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,840
taste of what it looks like when we say

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:45,450
SOC independence

00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,100
math means so this is very important

00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:49,530
part because we believe Metheny is

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,840
actually the action that's you know

00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:56,280
extra mile for from your development

00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,530
platform to give you a specific angle to

00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,160
penetrate certain market so we do have a

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:03,510
very active ninety six more maddening

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,970
community which is completely all the

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:09,300
self organized by the participant

00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:12,120
developer himself actually we even we do

00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,890
have a guideline folder full that we

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,560
have many very very interesting

00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:18,300
communities on the Matheny in fact we

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,300
will talk about shortly about what we

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:25,440
design Universal John mezzanine to

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:30,150
bridge between the high-performance SLC

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,190
powered 96 ports you support the John so

00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:34,290
those are the messaging product majority

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:38,250
of them are developed by the ecosystem

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:43,940
partners recovers from the very small

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:47,190
sense you know Bush sends kicked to very

00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:51,330
sophisticated for example have for you

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:56,520
know five glt onboard 4G 5g LTE

00:12:51,330 --> 00:13:00,000
modern silicon on boat and also your

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:03,540
view control unit at least I want to say

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,410
that this we are in support of the px4

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:10,410
developer summits we are giving away 50

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:15,530
of the 96 formats and most popular

00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:18,120
Matheny's and this will be this will be

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:20,010
anybody who feel everyone with the

00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,710
post-event survey will be able to get

00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:24,240
you know get the lucky draw once you

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:27,300
have you will be stripped away the one

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:32,340
phrase 19 spoke meta means okay so hope

00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:34,860
you win so yet just this new covers

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,110
older from Laura to robotics audio and

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,050
blt security

00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,490
LT you know I'm sure there will be some

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:44,430
some of them we should fix your

00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:46,770
development needs operating system and

00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:49,560
this again is his rapid changing on

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:52,230
weekly basis for some of them not

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,330
strictly or print and look at it but it

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,670
is very widely supported about different

00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:58,310
type of

00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,910
mainstream and actually some of them you

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:04,480
know probably more niche as operating

00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:08,540
system support in fact if you go on shoo

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,840
SUSE open SUSE or fedora

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:14,060
you know this OS websites you will

00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:18,710
probably find a dedicated section for a

00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:20,570
range of 96 port middleware SDK and two

00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:24,710
libraries so we have spent a copy of

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,320
effort action to to support an across

00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:31,160
community and which is we believe it's

00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:34,040
very important for 496 port developers

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,050
in fact what we hire remember highlight

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,430
19 sports beautiful production so we're

00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:39,680
not really just stopped it's actually

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,390
offering platforms where you can where

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,320
you can build your idea

00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:48,320
prototype actually point a clear path

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,660
from the hardware software stack and

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,040
tooling point of view for taking you to

00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:55,850
the journey of making the mass

00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:59,630
production so 96.9 is for AI industry

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:03,770
was first launched its March 2018 as he

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:06,530
proceeded with 13 company globally and

00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:10,100
today we have probably the most popular

00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:13,280
you know Iraq government boards which

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:18,610
analysis of portfolio including very

00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:24,590
very popular hiking 960 970 rot 961 96

00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:27,680
router 96 and AI ml from mx8 paste and

00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:30,080
XP different different skew of MX 8

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,650
based and of course the latest

00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:35,600
announcement we have had 17th of June

00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:41,300
and COCOMs

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:43,190
a 65 sea-based robotics robotic kit so

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:47,630
that is a very very popular in fact the

00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:51,140
first aren't diamond box some of the if

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:53,600
you if you pay attention to the field it

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:56,570
is actually on an easy spot inside it's

00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:01,940
called a sequencer 96 ports ok so the 24

00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:06,960
call 853 a very power efficient arm

00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:09,180
machine for developers so

00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:11,910
is not news but I wore like a highlight

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:14,100
again I steal this picture from image

00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:17,100
from John Cole website because I think

00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:20,030
that I couldn't make a better one so we

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:22,920
joined John Kohler as Goldmember and

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:26,970
with the reason why we do that is we do

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:29,460
believe we can support in arrow we just

00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:32,280
mentioned high performance John are in

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:34,440
the coming and it actually does as I

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,330
said the the spirit underneath a sport

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,850
we actually have considered this for

00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,650
long that decided it does not make us

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,620
make sense for us to reinvent the wheel

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:47,340
to develop another John specification

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:49,800
from ground up in fact we decided the

00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,680
working with John Code adopting and

00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,770
supporting some of the existing such as

00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,410
the Pixar hardware standards would be

00:16:55,770 --> 00:17:04,589
the best for the community but in order

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:07,620
for to enable the if I may say 11.0 John

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:10,860
platform children 2.0 John platform

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,440
which was much a higher demand in terms

00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:17,250
of the computing much higher level in

00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:20,850
terms of the no intelligence or mobility

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:23,610
and much diverse in terms of the sensor

00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:26,160
and the configuration of which we

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:28,980
believe that so that's 119 spoke can

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,020
help because that can't bring me to the

00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:36,300
second part of the presentation is that

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,340
96 ports on so we'll focus on

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,170
heterogeneous computing platform well we

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:42,690
enabled a multiple silicon performance

00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:45,180
silicon platform choice and provide a

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:47,780
flexible architecture food for the

00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:51,330
developers who have probably different

00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,880
experience or different paths when

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:57,840
coming to this field and we do support

00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,050
and Pixar as open standards and the

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,010
picture here is well give you an idea

00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:05,070
what we're thinking

00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:09,240
alright so we're designing a pixel

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:12,390
mapping mezzanine board well we used to

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:15,510
connect the 96 poor ecosystem from the

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:19,690
bottom to support the John code

00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:22,540
community picks a hardware stand

00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:25,420
on the top right I said well we consider

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,270
to not only actually anything sport

00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:30,640
mainboard but the necessary useful

00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,460
important analysis imagining for example

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,420
a given example here imagining who which

00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:40,560
give you LTE connectivity when you have

00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:43,090
that license necessary since in the

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,430
modem on on imagining

00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,920
away from the main board so 90 things

00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:49,990
will see considered that can have the

00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:51,610
range of differential Sisu the standard

00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,290
interface which is high speed and low

00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:57,760
speed interface 14 and 16 respectively

00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:00,040
with relevant antenna cable button in

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,220
supporting connected to the maddening

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,720
board picked on is nimble give EU the

00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,190
part of the performance associate where

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,740
you can offload the performance

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:11,320
computing where it does not make sense

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:18,490
to put on the you know a few a mojo

00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:20,980
itself or and also we we wanted to it

00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:23,800
becomes a generic interface working how

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:26,560
can support some of the payload the pink

00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:29,920
defines through the PPP interface if

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,490
you're familiar with the latest spec has

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:35,170
been going on in the drunken community

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:41,140
so that is what the physical can look

00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:43,120
like and going another level is a we

00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,000
call it Universal Nancy sport John

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,360
Madden II right and well you can see the

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,910
main part of the complexity will be

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,890
between the different the on that

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,480
mezzanine we need to handle all the

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,490
different interface and and the

00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,560
relationship have done so this today I

00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,180
should say the draft right this today

00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:03,970
states at the job so we won't take this

00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,790
opportunity of the government summit you

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:09,970
want to if you have any input at all are

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,590
we happy to discuss that and we're happy

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,680
to discuss our we're happy to bring the

00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,390
drafter to the John coach our that's an

00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:19,740
exchange student committee to gain more

00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:22,300
input where we can actually build this

00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,430
so those are some of the proposed

00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:27,280
interface in the capabilities I won't go

00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:30,490
through the very detail today but the

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,489
missus era slide is available and we

00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:35,739
definitely welcome any input you my hand

00:20:33,489 --> 00:20:40,169
for example you tell me okay these parts

00:20:35,739 --> 00:20:40,169
we probably looking at integrator more

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,519
you know some more sunlight i lateral

00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:47,830
sensors in which case we probably want

00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,320
to have you know higher brand new ways

00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:52,269
in terms of you know it snatch get

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,049
better a snare on board and we probably

00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:57,669
the more than one of them and to have a

00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:00,279
physical separation between different

00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:03,749
network so so we will definitely work on

00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:07,090
that feedback and this is chapter of the

00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:09,399
our starting points if you like and we

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,169
do put a lot of our emphasis in terms of

00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:13,989
the power design because this is wrong

00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,179
actually wrong the very practical issue

00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:18,639
which we have come across which we

00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,179
believe you know it matters a lot in the

00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:24,220
in this supporting for the joan

00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:26,830
lessening as well so please do take a

00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,840
look they take looks through the the

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:31,659
input and output we were thinking about

00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:35,139
in terms of the power distribution and

00:21:31,659 --> 00:21:40,509
the power company lately we do envisages

00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:42,309
a separate a power supply and but yes I

00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:44,139
won't read through them point by point

00:21:42,309 --> 00:21:46,359
because doesn't seem to make much sense

00:21:44,139 --> 00:21:47,979
for me to do that in live stream but if

00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:54,249
you have any question after presentation

00:21:47,979 --> 00:21:57,039
happy to answer them so that's my short

00:21:54,249 --> 00:22:00,639
presentation I hope that gives you some

00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:05,169
of the idea in terms of what we want to

00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:06,970
do here and we not only 119 school

00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,799
wanted to hear what we want to judge the

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,869
waste John Caldwell dyskinesia and

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:13,019
supporting your developments so thank

00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,019
you

00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,110
thank you dr. yang that was great

00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,870
there's a few questions from the

00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:22,340
community I just posted those on chat

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:24,500
with you yes

00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:29,570
yeah please read them out loud before

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:31,550
answering okay okay so first question is

00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:35,410
like any effort for positioning Indore

00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:40,220
Jones weighs 96 pool okay this is a very

00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:44,900
so this is good question and I must

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:46,910
admit today we have not actually go down

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:51,520
to that level in terms of the breaking

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:55,160
down two different or specific use case

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,710
indoor-outdoor Jones what we have had

00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,910
some experience with is that in the

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:03,740
robotics in the AGV

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:05,240
market so also the indoor and outdoor we

00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,000
were probably looking at the different

00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,950
sensor configuration and we will have a

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,620
different capability over receiving the

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,110
signals for certain input of the data

00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,910
for example Gemma's eye and we're

00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:20,330
probably using different

00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:23,030
well adopted different technology to

00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:25,910
achieve positioning or navigation

00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:28,100
capability so today I couldn't give you

00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,190
very specific detail answer for Jones

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:32,780
because we haven't got that point yet

00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:36,110
but I'm sure we will

00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:38,660
if there's any points which you can you

00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:41,660
guys can give which I'm you know we will

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,980
be happy to to discuss that I know that

00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,470
doesn't answer a question completely but

00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,710
I hope that tell you what we are and

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,230
know as reality the second question is

00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,660
what feature supporting a GP or Tencent

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:59,870
course on song okay that is a very good

00:23:53,660 --> 00:24:02,690
question so so today I think that the

00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:06,440
majority when we talk about AI supports

00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:08,780
we are talking about many from two

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,280
different angle right if people who've

00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:13,100
on the from the city came back a

00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:17,000
background they will tell you will be

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,890
more care more about how the tension

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,010
based or being and the deep neural

00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:25,160
network based computing being offload to

00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:26,750
different IP fabric so that IP february

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,980
could be cpu Ashley

00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:33,040
could it be GPU could be ASIC even could

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,480
it be MP you designed specifically for

00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,150
you know taking off loads of those

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:39,560
particularly near Network intensive

00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:42,440
calculation

00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,360
it could be FPGA it could be DSP could

00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,010
be all sorts of different IP fabric it

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,570
depends on how you implement them upon

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:50,930
the silicon point of view that's one

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:53,140
part of it second camp mainly looking at

00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,670
this from the framework pony well we

00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:57,920
probably more concern about which

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:00,560
framework you support you know natively

00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,360
I do support you know at what level you

00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:07,700
will be able to support them are you

00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:10,490
able to charge the computing to the best

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,780
of fates for purpose silicon computing

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:17,000
resource made available so so what I can

00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:19,580
say is a phone are we probably falling

00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,490
more in the first can if we are weak and

00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,580
from different any support platform we

00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:27,890
have a TGA based AI platform we have DSP

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,540
we have in fact in wrong with the latest

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,510
no we have actually a different type of

00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:34,460
course in one silicon's and supporting

00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:37,610
you know scalar based the vector base

00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,780
than the magic space the cat toy matches

00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:41,300
the wrong turn

00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:44,120
so a scalar based a vector based intense

00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,450
and basic computation but how they

00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:50,990
actually carry on carry out that that

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,990
computing a you know changes phone so

00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:56,030
quite rapid you know I think drastically

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:57,850
from a silicon to silicon having said

00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:01,430
that there are some actually very

00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:04,940
popular or actually quad becomes clearly

00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:08,240
established middleware and which we also

00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,670
support him in fact the if I may say

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,420
they actually will also divide music -

00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:15,920
exports

00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:18,890
differences for such as a TV mmm and so

00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,360
so I hope that's you know somewhat

00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:22,550
answer the question in terms of what

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,410
features are called AR the third

00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:29,990
question is about our like general votes

00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:32,660
right answer is yes and no I think the

00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:35,600
first of all is I think we may need not

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:37,970
only looking at a small silicon in on

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,410
awards and codecs and basically we

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:45,440
actually looking at some of the really

00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:48,360
capable not only mo buyer but actually

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,570
enterprise-grade silicon's and so we're

00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,250
looking at extra cross the spectrum and

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:56,910
for us it's really and that's once a

00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:59,190
second thing is that instead of focused

00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:01,650
one or two particular type of silicones

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,710
that we actually cross second platform

00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,270
and this is why you will see a startups

00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:07,650
actually build in silicon startups

00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:09,720
actually Union and state school to

00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,190
launch the silicon and we should

00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,320
probably don't sit on Trina board

00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:15,720
having said that a junior is a very

00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,330
important developer community in its own

00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:20,550
right same as raspberry pi which we we

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:23,430
have actually many math amines to to be

00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:25,710
able to enable the connect the

00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:27,600
connection with both community and and

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,160
we see them as a very successful social

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,950
engineering project but nineteen spool

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:36,570
has a difference talk in the focus in

00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,370
mind and again you know this is when

00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,100
mania also are today using the latest

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,510
the silicones as well the fourth

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,180
question do they come with a librarian

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:47,130
API program yes every board does and in

00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:49,140
fact every specific if you look at

00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,900
through every specification it not only

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:53,880
house pot requirement in terms of the

00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,640
interface hard world or I think of

00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,990
ability of the silicon but also have the

00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,780
requirement in terms of the bootloader

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:03,090
the femoral the security aspect aware

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,490
the kernel requirement the upstream

00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:07,650
status of the driver and the binary

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:09,330
blobs with a feature in crime under even

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,040
to the point where some of the protocol

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:15,870
requirement aversion are also encouraged

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:17,400
how is the processing of an AI system in

00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,270
your book comparators the Euro bonds are

00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,270
our unknown okay

00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,300
that is interesting and I think apart

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:32,180
from warm apart from one which is

00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:36,750
immediate and my and platform and I hope

00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:41,430
that the other well-known usual ones are

00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:43,650
actually pretty much 96 ports um so next

00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:48,740
question to all your SPC feed on all

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:48,740
your melon in balls right that is a

00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,269
Taliesin so so let me put in this way

00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:58,039
ideally

00:28:54,269 --> 00:29:02,700
that is what we would like in a very

00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:06,899
imperfect world however it doesn't

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:11,369
happen that way but what I can say is

00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:12,929
that most of our mezzanine who and all

00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:16,080
the many things were officially

00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:19,759
complying product they are are

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,859
electrically compatible and however

00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,389
whether because there's some optional

00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,700
features there are some mandatory

00:29:24,389 --> 00:29:30,719
features whether they are supported the

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:33,389
iOS you know in the same way through

00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:37,379
those connectors I I come you know I

00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:39,659
can't vouch for I can't say 100% but yes

00:29:37,379 --> 00:29:42,059
so look the cross compatibility between

00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:44,609
the manganese and a species the main

00:29:42,059 --> 00:29:48,419
votes are certainly one of the key area

00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:50,639
of for us in terms of competitive the

00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:53,009
cross compatibility amount of product is

00:29:50,639 --> 00:29:55,950
very important it's um user goal we want

00:29:53,009 --> 00:30:01,589
to achieve which what do you recommend

00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:03,719
for px4 fly system so we can play

00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:06,899
favoritism the owners in sport are

00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:09,089
important and so this is a hopes the

00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:12,320
last question I'm answering is actually

00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:15,929
we believe there are many many six ports

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,969
are to be you could be cuckoo pipe an

00:30:15,929 --> 00:30:19,830
official for different use cases or

00:30:17,969 --> 00:30:23,009
supporting high performance to export

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:26,249
fly system what we have done here is if

00:30:23,009 --> 00:30:30,859
I can find a boat here on my desk so

00:30:26,249 --> 00:30:34,259
this is a arrow co2 which you can find

00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:36,899
which you can find so this was the first

00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:40,019
amenities what we have done that were

00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:42,419
enabled so this is a Dragonball 14c one

00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:47,549
of the very first many six port and this

00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:50,669
is aerial cartoon 96 ball has takes

00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:56,659
takes full stack only what we've done is

00:30:50,669 --> 00:31:03,029
actually that has been put on wrong real

00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:05,759
real Joan commercial product so so this

00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:07,399
is you know four years of the product so

manner right different silicon from

00:31:17,299 --> 00:31:23,659
