Title: SmartWings - Active Turbulence Suppression for Aircraft

Summary: Research project on active turbulence suppression for aircraft. By means of anticipating pressure sensors in front as well as reactive intertial measurements inside of the aircraft it is possible to counteract disturbance effects of atmospheric turbulence in flight by deflecting control surfaces accordingly. Disturbances of the vertical acceleration, pitch rate and roll rate of an aircraft are likely to be reduced below 20% RMS.

Within the research project (TU Wien with three industry partners) unmanned and manned test flights are performed featuring Pixhawk flight controller, PX4 flight stack and additional custom hardware and software.
