Title: Drones4Energy Inspection

Summary: The session will be about the Drones4Energy project and its achievements in its second year. It is 3-years, Danish national project, started in December 2018 with a budget of 3M Euro. Details: https://drones4energy.dk/

Drones4Energy is an innovative drone project that contributes to the state of the art of electrical and communication engineering technologies to build a fully autonomous drone system that can charge itself from overhead powerline cables.

The overarching goal of the project is to deliver a collaborative drone system that can inspect the power grid in a highly efficient way. The project aims at using the powerline cables as an energy source to charge the drones without modifying the power grid’s infrastructure.

In this talk, I will be sharing the experiences of integrating PX4+ROS+QGC with other Hardware/Software/Communication elements to achieve the project goals.
