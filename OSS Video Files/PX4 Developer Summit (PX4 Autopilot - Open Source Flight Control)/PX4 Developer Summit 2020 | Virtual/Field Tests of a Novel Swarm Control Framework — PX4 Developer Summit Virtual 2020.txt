Title: Field Tests of a Novel Swarm Control Framework

Summary: The Raytheon BBN Technologies Unmanned Innovations Lab and teammates SIFT and OSU recently conducted the third planned field exercise of a novel swarm control framework, Command and Control of Aggregate Swarm Tactics (CCAST). The framework envisions controlling and monitoring swarms of up to 250 collaborative unmanned systems. The proposed video will show how we prepared for and successfully deployed over 60 heterogeneous autonomous systems simultaneously to cooperatively explore an urban area and modify their behaviors while interacting with pre-positioned items in the environment.
