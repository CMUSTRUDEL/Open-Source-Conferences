Title: Field Tests of a Novel Swarm Control Framework

Summary: The Raytheon BBN Technologies Unmanned Innovations Lab and teammates SIFT and OSU recently conducted the third planned field exercise of a novel swarm control framework, Command and Control of Aggregate Swarm Tactics (CCAST). The framework envisions controlling and monitoring swarms of up to 250 collaborative unmanned systems. The proposed video will show how we prepared for and successfully deployed over 60 heterogeneous autonomous systems simultaneously to cooperatively explore an urban area and modify their behaviors while interacting with pre-positioned items in the environment.

coordinated searching for simulated

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,920
intelligence to use scattered throughout

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:27,420
an area of concern in our case in the

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,150
form of April tags placed in the

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,040
environment and - a module that reacts

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,110
to virtual actors in the environment

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,170
through Bluetooth Low Energy protocol

distributed autonomous agent logic

00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,660
embedded in the C past framework is

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:44,670
constantly monitoring platform health

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,280
and the status of other nearby agents

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,570
and their progress towards shared goals

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,329
agents can dynamically request help from

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,040
other platforms for instance a platform

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,780
sensing low battery will automatically

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,299
request a replacement to pick up where

00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,950
it left off

00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:01,019
similarly C cast incorporates multiple

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:02,730
levels of dynamic obstacle avoidance for

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,769
preventing collisions with obstructions

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,239
and other agents as well as autonomy

framework for localization and

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,140

00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,140
outdoors

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,840
positions and status of c-catch

00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:19,060
platforms can be monitored on-site and

00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:20,889
remotely in near real-time with a

00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,289
