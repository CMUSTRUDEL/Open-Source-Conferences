	Title: Microsoft AirSim: Applications to Research and Industry

Summary: In this talk, I will begin with an overview of Microsoft AirSim, an open-source simulator for autonomous vehicles built on Unreal Engine, and its applications in both industry and academia. Then, I will shift focus to enabling drone racing research with AirSim, and highlight two recent projects. The first being Game of Drones - a simulation-based drone racing competition at NeurIPS 2019. And secondly, a research project focusing on learning representations and imitation learning to address the drone racing problem.
