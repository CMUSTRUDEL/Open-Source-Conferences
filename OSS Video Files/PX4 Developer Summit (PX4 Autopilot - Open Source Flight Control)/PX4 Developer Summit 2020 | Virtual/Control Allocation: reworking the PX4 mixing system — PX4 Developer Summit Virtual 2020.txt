Title: Control Allocation: reworking the PX4 mixing system â€” PX4 Developer Summit Virtual 2020
Publication date: 2020-07-19
Playlist: PX4 Developer Summit 2020 | Virtual
Description: 
	In the PX4 stack, the output of the controllers is converted into actuator commands by mixers.
Although very powerful for the insiders, the current mixing system is not user-friendly and is limited to static configurations. In this session, we present ongoing work on control allocation, which aims at complementing or even replacing the current mixing system.
The future control allocation module promises easier and more flexible airframe configuration while enabling new features such as the continuous control of tilt-rotor transitions, and the handling of actuator failures.
