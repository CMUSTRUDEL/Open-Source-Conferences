Title: PX4 failsafe testing using MAVSDK

Summary: In order to ensure the safety and robustness of PX4 as it evolves, failsafe testing is critical.

This talk aims to give an overview of how failure can be triggered to test a certain failsafe response. I will be explaining the underlying architecture that enables this and shows how to do it using MAVSDK.

I also plan to hint at how this failsafe testing can be integrated as part of the PX4 continuous integration.
