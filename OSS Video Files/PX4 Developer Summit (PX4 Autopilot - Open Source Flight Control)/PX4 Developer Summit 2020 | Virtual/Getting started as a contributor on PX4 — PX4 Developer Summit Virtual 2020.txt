Title: Getting started as a contributor on PX4

Summary: PX4 is a big subject, sometimes it can be daunting to even begin looking at how to get started. We are going to present an overview of: the ways people can contribute to the project, how they can get started, and where they can go to drill deeper into particular areas of interest. While this content is directed at getting volunteers spun up efficiently, hopefully it will be of use to anyone getting started with PX4. This presentation includes a pdf file with important reference content and details which were omitted from the video, attendees are encouraged to refer to that pdf for additional information.
