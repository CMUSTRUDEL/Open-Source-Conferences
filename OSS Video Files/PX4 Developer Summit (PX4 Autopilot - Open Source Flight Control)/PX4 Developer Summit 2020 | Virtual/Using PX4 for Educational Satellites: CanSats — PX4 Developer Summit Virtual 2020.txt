	Title: Using PX4 for Educational Satellites: CanSats

Summary: If the future of drones is software-defined, then the future of satellites (CubeSats) could be software-defined as well. CubeSats are a fast follower of drone technology, and I believe what works for drones can be repurposed for satellites as well. In this presentation, I will exhibit how PX4 was used for Educational Satellite (CanSat) training in Nepal and what I believe the future can be for PX4 and space.

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd

community we're back thank you for

00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,130
waiting sorry I hope that wasn't too

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,559
long we're still at the px4 developer

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,830
summit remember px flora pilot is the

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,949
number one open-source autopilot let us

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,810
know how this is going please share your

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,789
comments on the chat let us know in

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,210
slack we're here waiting for your

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:26,580
feedback I have with me on the line

00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,590
Ava's mask II was going from Japan he's

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,890
a pianist to any like you sure Institute

00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:34,110
of Technology and has been directly

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,260
involved in four different satellite

00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,530
CubeSat projects placing seven

00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:42,840
satellites in orbit all right let me

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,760
change to my live video here seven set

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,020
of lights for normally this also evolved

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,570
building and launching the first

00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,270
satellite of Nepal Nepali set number one

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,399
is interested in camera design for space

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,500
applications machine learning for image

00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,750
classification and is actively working

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,850
towards educating the next generation of

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,859
Nepal through hands-on educational

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:05,489
satellites called concepts

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:07,020
since Nepal first training in 2016 wow

00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:12,240
that's a mouthful I'm really excited

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:14,070
about can you so hear me all right so

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,830
let me just switch to you right now

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:19,110
all right thank you so much and you're

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:19,860
welcome take it away yeah thank you for

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,680
that introduction

00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:27,270
looks like I'll I don't have to say much

00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:30,380
about myself now okay let me just share

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:34,860
that screen can you see my screen now

00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,880
all right okay hi everyone I am Abbas

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,310
Mizuki

00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,430
I'm currently a PhD student by but I'm

00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:43,020
also managing a very satellite project

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,200
that built the first satellite for Nepal

00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,060
and today I'll be also talking about

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,689
cube SATs but primarily focused on

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:55,259
concerts and I'll be discussing about

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:58,380
how I've used px4 for educational

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,299
satellites called concerts and what the

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,640
state of present and post pandemic

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:09,209
prospects for CubeSat kensit's can be

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:12,290
for using drone technology so these are

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:15,439
the agenda for today so

00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,409
do a bit of introduction and then we'll

00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,030
move on to drone keeps out connection

00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:22,879
because I think I'll have to introduce

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:24,469
what a CubeSat is and then from CubeSat

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,489
you will understand what I can set is

00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:33,049
and then I'll display what has been done

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:36,099
in Nepal for cancer and then how px4 has

00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:40,609
been implemented on it all right

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:44,120
so my schooling was done in Nepal Korea

00:02:40,609 --> 00:02:46,370
and right now in Japan involved in four

00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,500
different projects including birds three

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:51,500
which is the one that I'm currently

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,769
leading and we also built the first

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:57,200
satellite for Nepal called Nepali sat.1

00:02:53,769 --> 00:03:01,120
alongside Ravana one which is also the

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,750
first satellite for Sri Lanka and the

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,510
way I got into Cannes hats

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:10,129
the main reason why I'm doing this

00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:11,599
presentation is because of the

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,840
leadership training diary that I

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,549
received in Hokkaido University and

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,430
since then I have managed to do four

00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:22,849
different actually five six six

00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:27,379
different cancer programs in Nepal okay

00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:30,530
so let me move on to chipsets so what

00:03:27,379 --> 00:03:34,540
are the cube SATs so it's basically a

00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,879
satellite standard for nano satellites

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:44,989
nano satellites are one to ten kilo

00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:48,139
class the size is anywhere you can make

00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:52,250
it bigger but the standard size 1u size

00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:56,000
is 10 by 10 by 10 centimeter weighs

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:58,689
about a kilo and our single watt systems

00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,720
right so what you can do basically is

00:03:58,689 --> 00:04:05,720
stack them so you can take a 1u and then

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,720
make it to you and make it 3 u if you

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,349
need more power or volume or size okay

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,810
so these are not big systems you can fit

00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:19,510
them in your hand as you can see with

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:22,030
the Rubik's Cube if you

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,630
got that friend of chips at it's growing

00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:28,330
exponentially every year which is good

00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:32,920
news for us because we have more players

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,900
that means more innovation Kyushu

00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,540
Institute of Technology ranks number one

00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:41,260
in the world for small satellite

00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:45,490
launches from universities okay so we

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:47,260
have so far launched 16 and this year

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,570
we're planning to launch three more

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:54,220
that's part of the birds for satellite

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:56,710
project so we have excellent Center for

00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:59,830
nano satellite testing here at Q Tech

00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,960
and as you can see we have space

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:05,800
environment and also we have rocket

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,360
environment testing so these are all the

00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,180
satellites we have tested in Q tech

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,200
including Boyd's three this look this is

00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:17,100
a basically a typical time line for what

00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:20,170
a project keeps that project looks like

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,750
you can see that from kickoff to

00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,180
deployment it takes around one and a

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,050
half years and then we go into operation

00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:32,470
mode for two years these are some of the

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,390
images we have received from space we

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,890
have received images of Nepal Sri Lanka

00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:38,200
and Japan these are the stakeholder

00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:41,440
countries and we have collaborated with

00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:44,979
other countries to downlink their images

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,099
as well using our satellites

00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:53,509
it's also recognized worldwide we have

00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:58,969
1d 2017 diversity award and also better

00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:03,110
Satellite Award in 2019 so let's move on

00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:05,419
to drone and keep that connection so

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,719
what I feel and what I see at least and

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:11,059
this is just my opinion is that drones

00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:13,939
are fast followers of mobile

00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:15,499
technologies so whatever technology is

00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:17,929
being developed for mobile phones it's

00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:21,379
slowly trickling down to consumer drones

00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:24,079
and from there on what I see is that

00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:27,949
keeps ads are basically following the

00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:29,319
trend that drones are making so all of

00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:32,599
the technologies that are being

00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:35,749
implemented on drones are slowly being

00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,329
trickled down to keep set so basically

00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:40,009
there is just two main aspects of it

00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:42,409
right so if you really talk about it

00:06:40,009 --> 00:06:46,909
it's software and hardware let's look at

00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:49,039
operating systems for satellites so what

00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:53,360
I've seen through my personal study is

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:59,959
that the the use of operating system is

00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:02,779
increasing year by year so what I see is

00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:06,289
that in the future we'll have more

00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:10,579
implementation of operating system the

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:13,879
most of those operating systems are free

00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:16,939
and open source you can see that

00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,189
educational organizations and private

00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:23,209
companies are utilizing free and open

00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:26,659
source software's but the issue has been

00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:28,969
they are not reliable enough reliability

00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:34,449
is still an issue for the highest

00:07:28,969 --> 00:07:34,449
mission success you can see that the

00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:46,730
the satellites with no operating systems

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,730
are performing the best and

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:52,250
also dependent on the market so we are

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,670
using commercial off-the-shelf

00:07:52,250 --> 00:08:01,130
components using processors and sensors

00:07:55,670 --> 00:08:03,590
that are available in the market what we

00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:07,640
also see is that there is an increasing

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:10,520
trend in using stm32 even in Japan which

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,700
primarily uses pic for space systems

00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,780
they are slowly changing into stm32 as

00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:20,960
well this is very common that I saw in

00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,660
drone systems as well so since there is

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,000
a strong supply and strong demand for

00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,980
stm32 is i think this is going to be the

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,140
standard in the future as well so this

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:37,640
is basically coming up from the drone

00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:39,530
industry as you can see so if you think

00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,380
about it there is a lot of design

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,690
similarities you have constraints in

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,090
power weight volume cost attitude

00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,030
control is a little different because

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:52,610
drone is airborne and satellites are

00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:54,710
space borne but then you're using quartz

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:56,440
you're using the sensors you're trying

00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:00,410
to do wireless communication and

00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,590
reliability is always a factor in it so

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,990
I think everybody can sort of resonate

00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:08,240
with this we go through the triple-t

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,380
standard test test test I think with

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,380
drones you do that as well

00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,610
at least through a perspective of

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:20,460
somebody who develops keep SATs I see

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,620
that drones have met your open-source

00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,410
operating system have mature software

00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:29,190
and loop simulations our network

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:33,150
connected and use AI so they are already

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:36,150
doing edge AI so there is already a talk

00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:39,930
of software-defined drones which is very

00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:49,110
interesting so if we were to follow the

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:52,670
path let's say we were to implement what

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,050
drones used then we can repurpose the

00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:58,320
operating system that drones have used

00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,930
right we can repurpose the software in

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,890
loop simulations and since we have

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:07,410
access to drone hardware supply I think

00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:11,100
the future can be protected that way so

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:17,250
we could if we were following the path

00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:19,020
that was set by by drones then we can

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:24,780
probably talk about software-defined

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:28,800
satellites in the future so let's talk

00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,730
about cancer development in Nepal so

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,000
what are cancers

00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,580
cancer are non as flight satellites

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,870
primarily designed for educational

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:43,200
purposes and it's a tool to prepare

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:48,540
students and faculty for future CubeSat

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:52,620
projects as you can see here I can you

00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:57,230
can fit a can as a satellite inside a

00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:01,650
can and you can see that as it has

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:06,030
evolved there there are components used

00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:08,279
from drones there are also Rovers that

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,129
are sort of

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,839
sudo can set sudo Rovers and these are

00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,759
especially used for bring back missions

00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,939
in a competition called Alice

00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:23,579
you'll notice here J is here from px4 so

00:11:20,939 --> 00:11:25,529
the way I got trained to keep SATs is

00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,749
also through cancer so cancers are very

00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:31,199
important for anybody who's starting out

00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:34,350
with keep set so I began with Korea

00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,959
cancer competition in August 2014 then

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:39,720
got to participate in cancer leadership

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,910
training program which trains people to

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,120
go back to their country and then start

00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:47,970
cancer programs right so Nepal didn't

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,009
have any cancer program before so I

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:53,309
launched a pilot program in Kiruna

00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:55,079
University in December of 2016 and then

00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:57,930
since then we have done it every year

00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,899
the one that I'll be focusing today is

00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:05,069
the wonder that we did in September of

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:06,569
2017 in institute of engineering one

00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:12,660
thing to note is that all these programs

00:12:06,569 --> 00:12:16,170
are free and also as we move on to 2018

00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:19,829
2019 and 2020 we are trying to target a

00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:22,259
younger audience while using the next

00:12:19,829 --> 00:12:25,290
generation of trainees so there is a new

00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:28,559
generation of trainees and a new

00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:32,149
generation of trainers right so that's

00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:35,490
the model that we are moving forward in

00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:40,110
so let's look at px4 being implemented

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:42,480
on the cancer as you you'll notice that

00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:46,470
these are just drone components you have

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,319
GPS you have so what I did was I just

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:51,329
use the Wi-Fi for communication and then

00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:54,660
you have the onboard computer which is

00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:58,290
two picks racer these format this size

00:12:54,660 --> 00:13:00,029
was perfect for me and then for EPS I

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:01,860
didn't use this board but I use another

00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:05,069
board but it basically the idea is to

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,279
distribute the power and charge the lipo

00:13:05,069 --> 00:13:09,749
and then you have the battery which is a

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,639
standard lipo that you can buy off the

00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:20,110
shelf and the structure was designed in

00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:23,760
SolidWorks the structure

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,750
is then printed out using 3d printing in

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,430
mechanical engineering we call it

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:29,820
additive manufacturing that's just a

00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:32,920
nice way of saying it and then you have

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:37,000
as you can see from before it's just

00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:39,120
been neatly packed into a small let's

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,750
say it does look like a Pico satellite

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,640
so 50 by 50 centimeter and then Center

00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:48,130
five centimeter and then you have a

00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,920
parachute here that goes and attaches

00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:55,690
here so that it doesn't fall straight to

00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:59,080
the ground and this is just an example

00:13:55,690 --> 00:14:01,570
of the testing once the hardware is

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:05,580
integrated all I had to do was load the

00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:10,150
px4 firmware and then link it up with

00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:12,610
Wi-Fi and now I had a can set that was

00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:17,740
working so I was using all the sensors

00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:21,610
and let's say the GPS and everything

00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:23,920
from drone and then utilizing on a can

00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:29,020
set and what I did was I tested the

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:32,890
distance because distance does matter in

00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:36,670
our case and 100 meter transmission test

00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:40,780
between the Wi-Fi of the laptop and the

00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:43,870
can set was possible and for on the

00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:47,200
laptop itself or ground station I use

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:53,160
cue ground control so just a standard

00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:57,550
way of using drones as well so this is

00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:02,280
these are some of the images that we're

00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:05,920
taking bhindi 2017 can start training

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:09,790
you will notice that students are using

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:12,970
the PX a pix racer and they're placing

00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:16,840
it on the structure then loading up the

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,090
firmware and then testing it yes so the

00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,880
next picture will show next slide will

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:24,040
show how we deployed it we didn't have

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,840
any deployment mechanism at the time so

00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:31,140
what we did was we basically climbed to

00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:34,399
the top of the building to the roof and

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:37,609
basically threw the cans

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,059
and probably around 10 meters of height

00:15:37,609 --> 00:15:45,709
so the 100 meter was that we tested was

00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:50,329
more than enough after let's say

00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:52,519
deploying we then did data analysis the

00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:56,119
students looked at the data and then try

00:15:52,519 --> 00:16:00,339
to analyze how the cancer was moving how

00:15:56,119 --> 00:16:05,539
much distance it covered and so forth

00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:09,329
so if you look at the future there are a

00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:11,999
couple of challenges first thing is

00:16:09,329 --> 00:16:15,600
it cost me hundred dollars to make one

00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:18,929
of those cans ads and that's still high

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,929
because an engineer's income in Nepal is

00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:22,920
three hundred dollars I think this is

00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:24,869
this is really funny

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,199
probably in Switzerland but that's the

00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:31,259
reality back home so that's significant

00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,660
amount right hundred dollars and another

00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:36,299
issue I saw was that components let's

00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:37,679
say I want to buy picks racer in Nepal

00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:41,069
it's not possible

00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,129
so component availability is also an

00:16:41,069 --> 00:16:46,519
issue so what what I did I challenged

00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:50,220
the next generation of trainers to do

00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:52,649
was to build up can sets with components

00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:55,679
that are available in Nepal right so use

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:56,220
what is available in a part so that was

00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,649
what we did

00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:00,989
since 2018 that's why we had to

00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:03,929
discontinue using px4 but then because

00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:07,260
of the pandemic I'm starting to look

00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:10,639
back and see if I can leverage don't

00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:15,679
technology in in concerts and keep sets

00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:21,179
so let's have a look at the future then

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:25,199
so one of the things that um jay from

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:28,399
px4 and I've been working on basically

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:32,000
he's been doing the work is on the

00:17:28,399 --> 00:17:34,320
software in the loop simulation so that

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,990
that's a game changer I think you all

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:43,070
you need is a laptop and you can program

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:46,980
and then run that program on to the the

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:53,399
simulation in this case it's gazebo

00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:56,090
using px4 and that allows allows us to

00:17:53,399 --> 00:17:59,750
adapt to social distancing as well and

00:17:56,090 --> 00:18:04,080
there is potential for future virtual

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,789
can such trainings and competitions and

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,210
these are going to be very low cost

00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:12,320
because laptops most people already have

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:15,840
laptops you don't need to invest in is a

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:21,059
separate cancer and I think there's huge

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:22,480
potential in this area with that I would

00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,770
like to just conclude

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,770
