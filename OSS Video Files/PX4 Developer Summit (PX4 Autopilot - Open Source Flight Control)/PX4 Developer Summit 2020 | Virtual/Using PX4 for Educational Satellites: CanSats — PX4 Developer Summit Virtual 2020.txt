	Title: Using PX4 for Educational Satellites: CanSats

Summary: If the future of drones is software-defined, then the future of satellites (CubeSats) could be software-defined as well. CubeSats are a fast follower of drone technology, and I believe what works for drones can be repurposed for satellites as well. In this presentation, I will exhibit how PX4 was used for Educational Satellite (CanSat) training in Nepal and what I believe the future can be for PX4 and space.

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
