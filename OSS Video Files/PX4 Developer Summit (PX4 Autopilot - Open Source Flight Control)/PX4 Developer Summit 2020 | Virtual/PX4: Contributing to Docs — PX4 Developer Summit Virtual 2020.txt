hi

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,200
and welcome to this talk on contributing

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,080
to the px4 docs

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,280
i'm hamish this guy i'm the core dev

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,120
team member responsible for

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,640
documentation of px4

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,760
q ground control mavlink and mav sdk

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,600
i'm essentially the go-to guy to answer

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
questions and help you with contributing

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
to documentation

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,599
within the px4 queue ground control and

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,679
mavlin communities

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,160
so today i'm going to talk about why

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,360
contributing to docs is so important

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,680
and also what docs you can contribute to

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,960
as part of this community i'm going to

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,360
explain

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,239
how you can help what documentation you

00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,879
can improve

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,559
what sorts of things need fixing and

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,440
then i'm going to give you a quick demo

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,480
and overview

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000
of how to do little edits bigger edits

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,399
raise issues for things that you're not

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
sure how to fix and also the translation

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,399
tool chain

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,840
everything i'm covering today is also in

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,439
the documentation of course

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,280
under contribution documentation

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,280
contributing to the documentation is

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,000
really important because it saves

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,439
time and effort overall for the project

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,960
it allows us to retain

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,360
information once developers leave

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,640
it allows us to onboard new developers

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,880
and answer questions

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
without having to go back to the core

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,119
development team

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
every single time and also it allows us

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,360
to highlight the features

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,720
that we're inventing so that people can

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,320
come and use them

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,880
which they can't do if they don't know

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,000
about them so when i refer to the docs

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,520
what do i mean

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
essentially this set that you can see on

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,799
the screen the px4 user and developer

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,200
guides

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,640
the qgc user and developer guide and the

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
mavlink and

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,520
mav sdk guides these all use the same

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,360
git book legacy tool chain to compile

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,320
text files written in markdown

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,360
into html the source files are stored

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,840
and managed in github

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,600
just like application source code and

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,320
this gives us a really reliable way of

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,479
managing

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,360
bugs and contributions if you're

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,520
wondering how you

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,679
can help the best way that anybody can

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
help is not to ignore any problems that

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,400
they see

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,319
so if you see a broken link or a

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,360
spelling error or grammatical error then

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,640
please

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,879
fix it if you're working on an area

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,640
and you find something a bit confusing

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,560
perhaps or missing content

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
particularly if you have to ask for help

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,480
on how to answer it

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
then or how it works then take the

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,120
information you get back from the

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,959
development team

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,319
and try and integrate that back into the

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,319
documentation

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,560
and that will help everybody else who is

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,480
in working on that in future

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,760
if you're working on new features then

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
remember that they're not particularly

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,319
useful necessarily if nobody knows about

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,879
them

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,480
or knows how to use them perhaps if

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,400
you're working on an area that already

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,360
has some documentation like companion

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
computers

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,720
then you could extend that information

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,800
for your specific case

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,959
and last of all if you do want to help

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
then introduce yourself on the slack

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,040
channel

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,680
x4 slack documentation and let us know

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,519
what you know

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
what you're interested in and we'll try

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,480
and help you find a documentation

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
project

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,599
we make it really easy to fix and report

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,239
problems by having these little icons on

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,440
the top of

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,120
every page this icon you click

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,000
to open a web editor in github to fix

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
the content

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,799
and propose a solution and this icon you

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,599
can click to create a bug report

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,560
and all you need is a free github

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,640
account

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,480
i'll show you how to use these buttons

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,280
now

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,840
so to demo this let's have a quick look

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,920
at

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,920
our main documentation page

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
and if i look at the menu i see that

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,720
there's a structural error here

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,680
style guide should be at the same level

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,560
as building

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,599
the git book locally so i go to the very

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,840
top of the page

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,480
i see my little edit icon and i press

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,959
that

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,080
and i'm taken to the master version of

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,400
the documentation

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
note not an older version but the

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:13,120
current head revision

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,799
and you can see here my markdown

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
interesting things to notice about

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,359
markdown is firstly that

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,120
headings are proceeded by a hash

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,720
which indicates how many levels they are

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
so this is a level one heading

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,880
contributing to documentation

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:32,560
level two heading for quick changes

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,360
i can see numbered lists are prefixed by

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,960
one dot and i don't have to number them

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,400
that happens automatically

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,240
and everything underneath has to be

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,880
indented

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
i have this note anything that's

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,919
formatted with

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,479
an a carrot and bold it says note or

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,680
tip and then some text will be rendered

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,720
as a pretty

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,840
uh notes box

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
in the main version

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,800
bullets they're proceed

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,800
simply done as asterisks

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,120
i can use three back ticks

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,120
to highlight code

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,639
anyway i wander down here and i see the

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,000
style guide

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,280
is indented that's level two heading

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and preceded by a level three heading

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,680
and i'll just make

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,360
this into a level two heading as well

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,360
i can preview my changes

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,199
if i wander down here you can see that

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,960
something has changed if i change some

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,120
words i would see

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,320
the changes highlighted what was removed

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,320
and what was added

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,720
now at the bottom i have a commit

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
message that i have to add now it's

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,320
important here to add something

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,320
short and concise that helps people

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,960
understand what change was made

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,960
so i'm going to say contributing docs

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,600
fixed up heading levels

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,840
so what you'll do is commit a new branch

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,680
and you might give it a meaningful name

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,319
like contrib and then propose

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,600
change and that has now created a commit

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,520
which is the change that you want to

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
make you could have a

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
multiple multiple commits in a pull

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,240
request

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,960
and this is a pull request i'm creating

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,639
now which just includes this one commit

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,400
that i just created

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,639
changing the style guide and so now i'm

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:36,160
just going to say

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,160
the heading levels

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,479
were incorrect

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,120
i create that pull request and then i

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,720
will hit

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,199
squash and merge

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,560
and that change has now gone live into

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,479
the master branch

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,639
and in about 10 minutes this will

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,080
rebuild with style guide at the same

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
level as these other headings

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,440
now that was making a quick edit it

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,479
really is as simple as that

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,960
you make the you click the button

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,360
you make the edit in the page you create

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,840
a meaningful commit

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,880
you create a meaningful pr statement and

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,160
then you press

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,319
submit and it gets reviewed if you're

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,720
not sure exactly how to fix the page

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400
then you can instead create a bug report

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,319
and you do that by pressing the little

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,039
bug item on the top of every page

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,520
that opens an issue report which has a

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
link

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,120
back to this particular page so all you

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,520
do

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
is you update with a detailed

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,560
explanation of the problem

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,840
and possible solutions and then select

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,000
submit new issue doing quick edits in

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,639
github is great for fairly small changes

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
and contain

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,360
changes that only affect one page but if

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
you have changes that will affect a

00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,160
number of pages

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,560
or you want to change images then it's

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,479
much easier to download the source

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
modify it locally on your computer and

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,080
then re-upload it

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,759
you can do those sorts of things on

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,400
github if you want

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,000
but it's a lot more fiddly there are

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,319
instructions for all of these things

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,680
in the dev guide under contribution

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,080
documentation

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,960
and the sections get push documentation

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,960
source code

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,800
and also building the git boot locally

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,080
i'm going to show you how to do this on

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
windows next

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,039
it's the same for ubuntu and mac os uh

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,800
just the dependency installations a

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,800
little different

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,240
and because the downloading is all a bit

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,279
slow i'm going to do it

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,839
in faster than real time in order to

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,680
make

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,680
our larger edit we need to get the

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
source down to our computer

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,640
and for that we're going to need the git

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,240
tool which we can get from gitscm.com

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,000
and there are download packages and

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,480
instructions for the main

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
operating systems we're also going to

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,399
need to download and

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:06,720
install node.js from nodejs.org

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,720
as we require that to use gitbook

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,160
now to get the source we go to the

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,519
library we're interested in this case

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,560
the dev guide

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,959
and at the top of the page there is

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,399
the github button which we click and

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,920
that takes us to the main repository

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
now we could just duplicate this

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:26,240
repository but for managing change what

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,399
we do is we fork it by click

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,160
clicking the fork button this takes a

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
copy of the whole repository under your

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:35,360
own area and i've already done that

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
on the hamish fully dev guide

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,920
so this is my copy of the main

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,519
documentation set

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,600
and i'm going to get it down to my

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,560
computer by cloning it

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,040
so click clone button then click this to

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,880
copy the url

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,880
git clone and

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,880
batch url i just copied

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:06,800
now i enter that directory

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,000
and i am going to do what's called

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,399
creating a

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,399
remote and that remote is a pointer

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,760
to the original documentation set

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:25,040
and it's going to be here called

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,480
upstream so it's get remote add upstream

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,480
and then the url

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
now i need to do this because i'm about

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,959
to make a change

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,519
and i want to make that change to the

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,959
very latest version of the documentation

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:40,160
not whatever i happen to have in my copy

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:43,680
so now i enter git checkout

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,399
master to get the latest version of the

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,040
branch

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,519
then i do get fetch upstream

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,880
master to fetch the latest version of

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,240
master from

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,240
the main documentation set

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:04,079
and then i enter git pull

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,920
upstream master and that pulls the

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,000
changes into my local branch

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,600
so i now have exactly the same as

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,160
upstream

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,000
then i decide to make a change to the

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,880
documentation i create a branch to do

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,079
that on

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,600
git checkout dashb

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,000
that means i'm going to create a new

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,000
branch

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
and i'm going to call it my changes and

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,600
i'm going to check it out

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,000
now git status shows me that i now have

00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,959
a

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,440
clean tray and i'm on my new branch

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,120
while i'm here i'm also going to install

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,720
git book

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
first i have to install the gitbook

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
client for my whole computer

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,800
which i do using the instruction npm

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,200
install git book ply

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,920
g and i use the instruction git book

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,680
install

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,279
in the root of my current directory to

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,839
use that client to install

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,839
all the plugins

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
after gitbook client has installed all

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
the git book plugins

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,639
in my particular library the dev guide i

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,320
can now

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,639
serve it to view what the rendered

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:14,959
version looks like by typing git book

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,959
serve

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,079
and now if i go to this url which it's

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,240
serving the book on http

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,320
localhost 400. i can see

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,600
that indeed the rendered version of the

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:33,279
documentation

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,079
is indeed there now let's have a look

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,320
inside

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,160
our dev guide clone at the top we have

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,440
assets that's where you should keep all

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,079
of your images

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,079
there's no particular structure to these

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,240
though we would prefer that you put them

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,279
in sensible folders

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,079
uh there's the en folder that's where

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,519
all of our english translations are kept

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,600
and since everything is initially

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
written in english this is where your

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
files are

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,160
everything should be in a sub folder and

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,360
then

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,240
last of all we have summary summary is

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,920
very important because anything that is

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,959
not in the summary folder

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:15,839
but sorry the summary.md file will not

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,440
be rendered into html

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,440
now i'm going to show you how i might

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,200
make a quick edit

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,880
for example i might go to the setup

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,000
folder and

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,600
copy one of the existing documents as a

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,040
placeholder and i'll just call it

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:34,639
fred open

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,880
fred and put in fred

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:43,519
topic and some content

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:48,639
as you can see here i save that

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:52,959
and i go to my summary file

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:56,079
and up here under getting started

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,079
i'm going to add

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,720
fred

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,720
now i'm going back to my companion

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,160
prompt and i can see that

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:17,839
i'm no longer serving my git book

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:17,839
so i'll reserve it

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,240
and now i can go back to my localhost

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,560
generated

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
version of git book if i open getting

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,160
started i can see my

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
new document fred has appeared in

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,880
sidebar

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,680
so now i exit out of gitbook

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,440
and i go git status and i can see my

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,079
changed documents

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,839
so i can do add them individually but

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,040
instead i'm going to add them together

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,680
with git add

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,839
dot now you can see that those two are

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
part of are ready together to be

00:14:53,839 --> 00:15:00,000
committed

00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:04,240
git dash m and i put a message

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,199
adding a fred commit

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,839
you would do something more meaningful

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:11,199
and then

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:15,920
i push my changes to my room

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,920
using git push origin my changes

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
if i come back to my repository on

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,680
github

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,279
i now have this notification about that

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,760
push i just made

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,040
and that makes it very easy to click

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,040
compare and pull request

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,920
and here i can make i can have a quick

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,480
look at the changes i made

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,240
and i can put in a descript a

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,759
description of this

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,519
particular change that i've made and

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,560
when i'm ready i select

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,199
create pull request and that then

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,000
is handled in review and discussion in

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,519
the same way

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,279
as the quick edit translation

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
is another great contribution you can

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,480
make to the community

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,800
we have teams working on all the

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,480
libraries including mavlink and q

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,079
ground control developer guide and the

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,519
px4 user guide

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,560
and also queue ground control itself

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,279
all translation is done in crowding

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,519
the source text is in english in github

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,560
and gets synced into crown him

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,000
translated and pro approved and then

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,320
once approved

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,160
github will create push requests to push

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
the different translations into

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,639
subfolders

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,759
in github what's great about this is

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,360
that crowdin

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:34,560
manages change if we change the source

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,759
strings in the english version then

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,480
the output will include those english

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
strings until the content gets

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,600
re-translated

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,440
and that means that okay we may have

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,839
lost some translated information

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,240
but at least the content is always up to

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,560
date that is translated

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,519
and we can see these files in the dev

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,880
guide on

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,880
github here we have the

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,959
en english tree which has all the

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,920
original source files underneath it

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,640
and here we have translated files for

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,199
german

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,199
and spanish and japanese and so on

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,880
further down we have langs.md langs.md

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,160
defines what is actually built by

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,839
getbook

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,839
and you can see that we only build

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,360
english and chinese because chinese has

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,839
the most translations

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,880
we'll add the others as more work is

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,240
done

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,640
if you want to build a particular

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,000
translation locally you can always add a

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,799
line here

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,400
yourself now we can have a quick look at

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,039
that in crowding

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,760
here i am in the px4 developer guide

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,120
project

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,600
there are other projects that i'm a

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,120
member of i can see what languages are

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,960
available and i can see what levels

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,039
translated

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,480
and if i select for example on chinese

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:51,760
simplified

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,520
i can view either all strings or i can

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,080
view particular files

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,120
and here i can see what you see is what

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,799
you get version

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,280
and i can click any string that i want

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,919
and i can enter a translation for that

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,960
if i wish

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,799
and it gives me some suggestions

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,320
and i can also look at existing

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,200
translations

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:16,320
now as an approver you will also be

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,440
offered

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,240
at below this option to approve

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,840
something

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,760
and usually you'll have a team of two

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,679
people somebody will be an approver

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,120
for the other person's translations and

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,200
vice versa and you

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,039
click this and that's what makes this

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,720
particular translation

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:39,120
go public i can also filter

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,760
on various things for example here

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,120
if i only want to see things that are

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,799
untranslated or

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,160
only want to see things that are not

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,200
approved or approved

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,400
i can do that too so translation is

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,160
pretty straightforward

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,160
but if you do need help or you have any

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,640
questions perhaps you want to

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,360
create your own team then you can get

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,160
help

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,760
using the translation channel on px4

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,240
slack

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,160
thank you very much for listening i hope

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,160
i've convinced you all that contributing

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
to docs is a really good idea and giving

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,480
you some

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,000
ideas of how it's done remember that all

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
this information is again

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
in contribution documentation in the px4

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,160
dev guide

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,480
and if you have any questions we will

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,600
answer them if you post them in px4
