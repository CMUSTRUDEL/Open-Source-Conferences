00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:30,750
community welcome to that the export

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,870
developer start I want to thank everyone

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:37,380
for clinging we're incredibly excited to

00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,990
have more than 1,600 of you here before

00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,520
we get started though I want to thank

00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:45,350
the team of more than 70 who are making

this event possible staff volunteers

00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:54,900
speakers sponsors partners and last but

00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,449
not least my family there's no denying

00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:00,870
that copy 19 has dramatically impacted

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:03,600
the lives of all of us remember one

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,360
small gesture can save lives please

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,620
follow your local authority guidelines

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,090
take care and help others during the

00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:13,650
following days we're going to take a

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,870
deep dive into the depths of a fee

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,180
expert community in the year since we

00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,909
last met in zurich and the community has

00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:22,200
been really hard at work but when to

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,600
start the day off by announcing that

00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,570
maximal innovations today join from good

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:31,560
as a silver member thank you maximal

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:33,840
innovations I'm going to be hosting the

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,939
main track of the conference I'll be

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,399
joined by community speakers selected by

00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,350
the content community you will be able

00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:43,200
to ask questions to speakers at any time

00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,619
during your presentation 14 of community

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,360
volunteers or collect questions the

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,909
pre-recorded talks can be found on the

00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,380
px4 youtube channel make sure you don't

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:54,719
miss the speakers on the chat room while

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,609
the video can hear as well feel free to

00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:59,399
ask as many questions as you want so

00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:02,549
unique opportunity make sure you make

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,409
the most out of it make sure you follow

00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:08,009
px4 on social media for special

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:11,580
announcements let's get started with our

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,840
first speaker dr. Lawrence Mayer is the

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,390
co-founder of Athenian

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,760
chairman of drunkard he will be

00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:20,640
presenting setting the standards in the

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,430
drone industry for a decade Lorenz is

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:28,220
flying in from third please standby

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,220
electronic you don't move be right back

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:39,370
I really hope that we can meet next year

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,460
in person I really really appreciate it

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:46,000
meeting everybody last year in Zurich in

00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:49,060
summer having time off having time out

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,300
as well next to all the intense

00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,040
presentations now I do hope that the one

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,260
benefit we're gathering getting this

00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,190
year is that we have a lot of more

00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:03,970
attendees we have more than 1,600 people

00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:05,890
registered and without long introduction

00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,160
I would like to show some of the

00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:12,660
highlights that we have achieved as a

00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:12,660
developer community over the last year

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,870
so we really plan for this event of 400

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,050
people now we have a lot more registered

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,660
I am expecting that people will dial

00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,670
individually into particular sessions so

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,720
I'm not expecting everybody to be here

00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:33,940
for the opening keynote and a quick

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,870
introduction of myself Ramon has already

00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:40,410
introduced me I have founded a number of

00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:43,390
open-source projects back as students

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:48,150
over 10 years ago 12 years ago the first

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:52,480
one and these are forming together the

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:55,360
px4 ecosystem and by now I'm really the

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,030
chief cheerleader of that ecosystem but

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
we have a lot more developers that are

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:03,640
pushing this forward in particularly of

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:07,870
course Daniel Agger who is taken to

00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:10,750
technically now thanks to the fact that

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,269
we had to go virtual this is a truly

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,310
global event we're really stoked how

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:18,310
many people are dialing in from

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,620
literally almost every continent I don't

00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,240
know if we have Antarctica but other

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,770
than that I think we're pretty covered

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,500
and so I hope that this will spur

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:34,840
further discussions more contributions

00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:38,380
from across the world with that big big

00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,350
thank you to all of our contributors we

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,479
have hundreds of contributors across all

00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,830
the different projects this goes way

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,660
beyond px4 firmware

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,380
we have things like m'avez decay we have

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,720
the simulator and all of those have lots

00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:56,440
and lots and growing of contributors so

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,900
thank you for doing that if you haven't

00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,850
contributed yet there is a session in

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,400
the program please look it up how to

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:05,260
contribute please approach us on slack

00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,740
if you're not quite sure what

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:11,260
contribution means it typically means

00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,590
taking a change an improvement or maybe

00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:17,110
just a bug fix and sending a poor

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:20,260
request and github on to one of our

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:24,430
repositories so please keep doing that

00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:26,440
and I'm pretty sure we didn't capture

00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,860
all the profile pictures of every single

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:33,670
contributor but these hopefully stand in

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,070
for all of you who have contributed code

00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:39,280
have contributed documentation have

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,920
contributed flight testing and so big

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,410
big THANK YOU this community this

00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,290
open-source project really relies on you

00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:53,110
and we would be nowhere without your

00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:55,600
continued effort thank you so for those

00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:58,660
of you who haven't been with us for

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,990
years maybe this quick recap of our

00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:05,640
history is an helpful introduction so

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,650
I'll usually do this quickly every year

00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:11,830
pixhawk really started as a student team

00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:14,380
at ETH Zurich in 2008 we wanted to do

00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,960
autonomous flight using computer vision

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,690
on drones back then you couldn't buy

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:23,200
auto pilots so we ended up building our

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:25,750
own and then making the hardware and

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,940
software available as open source and

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,800
open hardware and this is really what

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:33,220
started this ecosystem because other

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:39,100
people came in piled in helped to

00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:42,010
develop that now twelve years later we

00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:43,960
really start to shape up industry

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,260
standards industry standards that are

00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,780
actually adopted beyond the coverage of

00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:52,360
just core open source as a as an open

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,180
source project but even companies like

00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,280
Sky do a parrot are implementing for

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,090
example our ground station communication

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,370
standard

00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:05,889
in their latest commercial models with

00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:09,010
that feel free to look that up there is

00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:13,120
also a history on our website we've come

00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,950
a long way and I believe that the

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,000
adoption of open source software will

00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:22,000
grow further because as these machines

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,840
as drones as autonomous systems become

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:30,280
more and more complex you really need a

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,490
very deep software stack and px4 itself

00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:35,260
is by now I would call it more like an

00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:37,330
ecosystem like Linux as an ecosystem

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,620
it's not just more anymore

00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:44,200
the core px4 kernel and so that growth

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,419
is forcing more and more individuals and

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,669
in particular also companies to adopt

00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:50,710
open source software because that's the

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,050
only way how they can keep moving

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,540
otherwise they would need hundreds of

00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,310
developers in every single company to

00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:00,880
achieve that and that's just financially

00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:03,490
impossible so things look great and I

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,680
hope that a lot of the companies that

00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,840
might still try to do things themselves

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,140
or everything themselves will come

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,200
around over the next one or two years to

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:15,960
adopt px4 because at the end of the day

00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:21,760
that's really the only way to sustain

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:23,710
software on drones going forward now the

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:27,250
other question that often comes up is

00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:31,060
like ok but how do I really build my

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:35,219
product how can I use the same code as

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:39,099
everybody else and then not get kind of

00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,169
just turned into a pure hardware company

00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:44,650
and have no profit have no

00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:47,110
differentiation now the way to do that

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:50,200
you can use open source software is you

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,250
have your product and you built a

00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,100
product at a particular point in time

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:59,320
maybe 2017-18 whatever it is and

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,029
typically that involves the industrial

00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,200
design that involves the whole airframe

00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:06,610
that involves the whole system

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:08,320
integration now back then you didn't

00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:10,450
need to have obstacle avoidance or

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,240
computer vision or safe landing planning

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,339
or anything

00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,800
like that today customers kind of

00:09:13,339 --> 00:09:17,420
expected so the cool thing is if you

00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,209
built that on top of an open source

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:24,470
ecosystem you can bring your product

00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:27,290
along so instead of just having now to

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,779
re-engineer all of that you can just put

00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:32,600
it on top of more technology that

00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:34,910
becomes available to you over time so

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,459
this is how you sustain your product on

00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:39,200
open source and I'm expecting the most

00:09:37,459 --> 00:09:42,380
of you on this call will understand this

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,080
but maybe you can pick this up as a way

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,660
to pitch it to your management why you

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:52,070
should and can work more intensely with

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:56,240
other developers now let's look at this

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:59,480
year 2020 what is px 4 it is still very

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,279
much what it was last year which is an

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:03,170
open source project that is used in

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
three core industries consumer

00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:07,640
commercial which includes government

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,850
usage and what we call industrial

00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,760
industrial is a bit emerging so consumer

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,740
we all know consumer drones there's of

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,870
course one elephant in the room with one

00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,670
very very big company that has a lot of

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,220
market share but there are still a lot

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:28,010
of companies that use px4 most of them

00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:30,470
don't talk about it in commercial people

00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:32,589
are much more proudly talking about px4

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:35,360
because it is about interoperability

00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:38,060
standards their customers usually want

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,970
to know what's inside they want to know

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:44,990
is that a software I can trust is it

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:47,000
transparent and so that's where we have

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,880
right now a lot of traction and I will

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,880
have quite a few examples of that in the

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,339
rest of the presentation now an upcoming

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,750
industry and actually the biggest

00:10:55,339 --> 00:10:59,660
difference between last year and this

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:02,600
year is in that sector our industrial

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,130
applications and to me personally the

00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,550
main difference between commercial and

00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:10,279
industrial is commercial is kind of a

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:13,339
better consumer drone it's a bit bigger

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:16,850
it's a bit more reliable it is built for

00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:19,870
workflows rather than personal joy now

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:22,370
industrial drones are built for

00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:25,970
continuous heavy operations they're

00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:28,760
waterproofed they are fulfilling certain

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:31,699
safety regulations and standards they

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:36,380
also are often a lot bigger and that

00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:39,860
includes cargo drones flying cars urban

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:41,630
air mobility I think px4 right now is

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,390
not something that's built for urban air

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,400
mobility but as we clock up more and

00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:51,850
more flight hours who knows where we

00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:56,630
will be running in 3 or 5 or 10 years

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:59,750
and we see that as a big trend across

00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:01,520
the whole industry governments and

00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,170
corporates are going more and more

00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,110
open-source and that's not just

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:09,110
Microsoft with github and Visual Studio

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:12,730
code it really is also Microsoft

00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:15,589
partnering with the px4 community and

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:18,020
deepening that relationship we have a

00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:20,060
great presentation from Microsoft on

00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,029
simulation on their integration with air

00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:25,850
sim check it out in the program and then

00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:28,610
also GE aviation has partnered up with

00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:31,430
latarian to use px4 in their safety

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:34,220
critical auto pilot also a great

00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:40,690
presentation on that topic by the GE

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:44,870
team check it out in the program now

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:47,029
there's one interesting thing that I'm

00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:49,160
lately spending more time on explaining

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:51,800
and that is the difference between px4

00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:54,350
as a technology and px4 as an ecosystem

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,459
and it's a bit the same thing as with

00:12:54,350 --> 00:13:01,760
the Linux kernel and the Linux ecosystem

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:03,529
the px4 ecosystem is really with px4 at

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,740
the core which defines the core

00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,880
interfaces the core technology and then

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,770
you have a number of open-source

00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,709
projects like your ground control and

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:15,770
MAV SDK around it which are also

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:17,449
technology fundamentally but now we

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,730
start to have more and more industry

00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:22,820
standards and these industry standards

00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,949
are standards that we are implementing

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,589
certain software functionalities certain

00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:29,300
interfaces like pixhawk like madelung

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:32,600
they have been around before but now

00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:36,130
we're becoming more clear about the

00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,640
boundaries about the functions and

00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,870
there's

00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:45,290
three Association and there we did one

00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:47,720
clarification recently drone code has

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,579
always been confused with px4 like I'm

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,459
running drone code or what is drone code

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,380
or is drone code a company no it's it's

00:13:52,459 --> 00:13:57,350
a dream code foundation and that's how

00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,970
we will start to consistently call it

00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:01,630
going forward it always has been a

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,890
non-profit in support of open-source a

00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:05,990
collaborative project by the Linux

00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:08,300
Foundation but we'll just call it drone

00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:10,850
code foundation and it's really clear so

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:13,399
that's the industry association behind

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,769
the px4 ecosystem which is helping to

00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,110
organize this event which is helping to

00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:20,990
organize our YouTube channels social

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:25,120
media which is contributing the salaries

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:28,190
of our program manager Ramon and of

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,850
ginger who is working with our community

00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:34,490
and then of course also really important

00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:36,860
there are third-party projects and this

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,050
is isn't meant as like dismissive third

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:42,079
party this is meant as very respectfully

00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:44,810
there are integral projects that we

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,360
really need to function like Ross and

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:49,310
we'd love to have a really close

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,279
relationship we have one of the Ross

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:56,149
founders Tali presenting here as well

00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:57,800
and our goal with them is to just work

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,620
really closely together and maybe

00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,750
converge on an ecosystem level the same

00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:06,620
way as I don't know Ducker and Linux

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:11,930
work really well together so also really

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:14,959
important now one of the urban myths

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:18,079
about Linux is that it's developed by

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,870
hackers sitting in the basement of their

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:24,220
mom's which is not quite true Linux is

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:27,199
for the past probably 15 20 years

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:30,079
developed by professionals working at

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:34,190
large corporations at IBM at redhead at

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,820
Intel and the same is very much true for

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,519
px4 initially it was driven by

00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,589
researchers and thoose iasts hobbyists

00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:46,190
but that has changed over the years

00:15:42,589 --> 00:15:50,180
relatively rapidly so today over 85

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,080
percent of contributions are coming from

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,860
enterprises

00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:59,060
and those are typically not IBM's but

00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:00,980
you know Microsoft for example but it's

00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,980
really companies using the software and

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,710
so we're continuously working with them

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:10,490
and one of the things I really want to

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:13,510
make really clear as somebody who is

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:17,180
both affiliated with px4 and o tarian

00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,980
really today it's all about px4 and

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:21,350
we're just showing the individual

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:23,350
companies who are contributing including

00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,210
oat Aryan which has big share here

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:29,210
because we want to make that transparent

00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:32,660
also in a way to thank you those those

00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:39,170
companies for their continued

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:43,610
contributions in terms of countries also

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:46,310
no big surprise there as oat Aryan has a

00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:48,230
lot of R&D in Switzerland we have a lot

00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:51,560
of contributions from Switzerland but we

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:55,610
also have contributors developers in the

00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:56,480
US and a lot of other companies who are

00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:00,020
us-based

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,310
so you see quite interesting pattern

00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:08,480
with Switzerland us Australia

00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:10,820
Portugal New Zealand not quite expected

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,490
and we of course hope that other nations

00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,709
will pick up here and so in particular

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,440
if you're from around the world if

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:20,360
you're in Asia make sure to see what you

00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:24,500
can contribute going forward so those

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:27,230
bars change a bit terms of firmware

00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:29,240
contributions we've again split that up

00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,940
between individuals who work as

00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:35,840
consultants and corporations those are

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:38,420
the top six or rather top five plus the

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,240
accumulated contributions you can see

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,820
again Teheran is doing a lot as a

00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,950
company that makes sense given I started

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,880
on my open-source mission 12 years ago

00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:51,950
and the company has become part of that

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,560
queue ground control we see that Don is

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:55,910
super active congratulations if you're

00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:58,820
watching or if you're watching a

00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:01,790
recording of this The Seeker system

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:04,850
really benefits from you and great work

00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:08,680
on QR control

00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:13,160
and then it got again simulator

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:15,190
avoidance you can see where the

00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,850
individual efforts are really focused

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:22,040
and we have SDK which is our SDK our

00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:24,350
user space API and really really

00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,660
important going forward for the further

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,970
adoption of px4 because just working on

00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:33,950
the core flight controls is way too hard

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:38,510
for many developers documentation again

00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:42,470
something that we're heavy so now we

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:44,930
know who built px for over the past year

00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:47,510
now let's look at who is using px for

00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:50,360
that's hopefully long term the same but

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:53,480
right now it isn't always so we've

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,190
leading products and developer platforms

00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,860
that are being built I'm not going to

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,120
read all of them just have a look at the

00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:04,490
logos have a look at the systems it is

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,500
awesome to see that diversity we have

00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,320
airframes that weigh hundreds of

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,480
kilograms or hundreds of pounds

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:16,130
we have airframes that are a pound

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,930
really reflects also the technical

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:21,010
capability of the software stack

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:24,530
supporting all of these applications I

00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:28,130
want to show a couple highlights this is

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:37,820
probably the most crazy example that I

00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:48,110
have so let me quickly just play the

00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:51,140
video and it's a quite surprising use

00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:54,680
case something I totally would not have

00:19:51,140 --> 00:20:02,120
anticipated that somebody would actually

00:19:54,680 --> 00:20:05,600
go ahead and fly a VTOL roof px4 as a

00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:14,980
person that's pretty crazy and inspiring

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:14,980
[Music]

00:20:23,449 --> 00:20:30,029
awesome so I don't want to steal the

00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:32,279
thunder of the person who did this so

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:36,149
this is an old video on purpose

00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:38,909
they're much cooler much newer videos so

00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:43,129
if you're interested in that check out

00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:48,019
the talk of Julien tomorrow

00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:51,989
make sure to dial in there's the time in

00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:54,059
Pacific Daylight Time you can also find

00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:58,759
it in a program really really

00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:04,319
mind-boggling very experimental now a

00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:07,729
little less scary but still big is this

00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:11,369
cargo drone by Valon Z also running px4

00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:15,089
this is a public safety firefighter

00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:16,229
drone by impossible airspace also

00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:21,359
running px4

00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:26,089
this here is a cargo drone that is also

00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:32,189
px4 based has made the news recently

00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:36,209
this is a government drone also by

00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:39,209
vantage robotics also brand-new pushing

00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:41,399
into the market running px4 this is

00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:44,909
another cargo effort for medical cargo

00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:47,459
by a be really awesome to see the

00:21:44,909 --> 00:21:49,349
diversity as you can see here most of

00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:54,979
you will have seen the unique products

00:21:49,349 --> 00:22:00,389
that around px4 then we have a

00:21:54,979 --> 00:22:02,539
waterproof VTOL by quantum systems you

00:22:00,389 --> 00:22:06,719
can even see the custom pitot tube

00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:10,019
heated and everything so really cool to

00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:15,089
see that industrialization that px4 is

00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:20,230
on right now we have the free flight

00:22:15,089 --> 00:22:22,760
alta and there's the alta x

00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:26,180
really really big drone being able to

00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,220
live really heavy camera gear used in a

00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,840
Hollywood really cool to see what

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:32,780
they're doing and the flight performance

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:36,110
they're getting out of it and then this

00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,930
is Elroy air with this in the background

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:44,570
is not a toy aircraft it's it's a real

00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:50,060
Cessna with a huge cargo drone based on

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:54,350
px4 really cool and then this is a

00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:57,920
recent startup from each age Zurich also

00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:01,190
running px4 on their over-activated

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,830
usually multicopters are under activated

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,100
this one is over actuated inspection

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,900
drone really cool and then of course a

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:11,240
company use you will have seen before

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,350
one that is very close to where I am

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:17,720
right now winged tram with a super cool

00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,380
tail sitter that is based on px4 as well

00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,110
so huge variety in weight in size and

00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:30,290
actuation but all running the same

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:33,620
flight control core with that let's look

00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:35,780
at what will carry this open-source

00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,160
project into more applications going

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,670
forward and that those are new

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,670
partnerships so Microsoft is not a new

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:47,450
partner from last year but they have

00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:50,060
renewed their push for integration we're

00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:52,810
working with them on air sim supercool

00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:54,950
check out their news blog post on it

00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:59,450
we've recently announced a partnership

00:23:54,950 --> 00:24:02,050
with arm / leonardo / 96 boards which is

00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:04,820
their hardware standard for arm boards

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:07,130
we're going to do a common Center

00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,950
together that's bringing the compute

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,890
board standard and our FMU standard and

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:16,460
is going to put that together into a

00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:18,770
smart autopilot similar to for example

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:23,030
the products model or from a turian sky

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,980
note that you've seen recently so let's

00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,310
quickly talk about a couple more

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:30,380
developer focused topics

00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,620
developer workflows so we're doubling

00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:36,350
down on testing and we have two

00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:41,080
awesome talks others will touch a topic

00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:45,710
as well around improving testing

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:48,800
including having fault injection in more

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,280
places in the system so super important

00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:56,390
for the further hardening of px4 and

00:24:51,280 --> 00:25:00,470
we're also going to have a restarted and

00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:03,860
increased flight testing from powered by

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:05,780
the drone code foundation for px4 board

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:08,510
support and hardware testing we have

00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:10,520
clarified how we do board support in

00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:12,830
this project so there are new three

00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:15,050
categories officially supported boards

00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:18,650
those come with the Pixar standard

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:20,740
manufacturer supported and experimental

00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,120
you can read that up it's online and

00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,730
we're adding more and more of these

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:29,450
hardware targets to the test rig this is

00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:32,090
work that Daniel is doing maintaining

00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:35,030
pushing big things to you Daniel this is

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,640
really important to spot regressions

00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:42,890
early as we move very fast with the code

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:44,990
base good user space API is Russ to

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:49,820
support their two cool talks please

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:52,630
check them out we are integrating more

00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:55,280
and be more more deeply with Ross

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:57,770
they're coming the embedded way we come

00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,620
with our publish/subscribe framework

00:25:57,770 --> 00:26:03,140
they're way really great collaboration

00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:05,120
for the last couple of years already and

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,390
I think it's now ready for primetime

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:12,170
also with us having finally Ethernet on

00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:15,679
the flight controller manifest DK you

00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:17,450
already have heard about it at sea SDK

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,840
for our ecosystem

00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:23,120
check it out on MAV SDK IO if you're not

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:25,670
familiar with it yet not going to spend

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,150
too much time on that it's a simple way

00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:31,700
to interface the px4 and that should do

00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:35,720
it in terms of description in terms of

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:40,400
safety and certification lots of talks

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:45,800
from Chris Anderson from James Howard

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:50,150
and from Gokul Krishna Srivatsa

00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:53,000
on various aspects of safety and

00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:54,890
certification BV loss which is one of

00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,110
the key drivers behind wanting to do

00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:02,570
certification so please check out those

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,400
with FM u v5 X we've really laid the

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,059
foundations on hardware standards for

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:11,270
that and now a number of companies GE

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,250
aviation NXP arterian are all pushing

00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,770
towards that within the open-source

00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:20,450
project and we're going to try to bring

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:22,820
ISO 26262 road vehicle certified parts

00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,590
and technologies and approaches into the

00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:27,440
drone space which is a lot more

00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,900
lightweight than aviation certification

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:33,350
but still has very very high pedigree

00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:38,360
and is accepted as being really reliable

00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:40,640
I will quickly dash through the pixhawk

00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:45,020
standard so we have enough time for the

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,690
QA so picks arc standards what is that

00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,140
like I you know you know the pixhawk

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:55,490
autopilot which is the initial hardware

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:58,850
that I did with collaborators back in

00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:01,220
the day 2013 and which is named after

00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,960
the student team at ETH which started in

00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,580
2008 now it's becoming a new life again

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,250
this time a standard because really what

00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:12,140
Pixar created with being open hardware

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:14,840
is creating a hardware standard because

00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:18,220
people took that design engineered

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:26,300
around it and so we essentially created

00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:30,380
a whole Hardware set that is why a lot

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:32,120
of drone software stacks drone hardware

00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:35,600
actually work together because there was

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,730
this pseudo standard now that the drone

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,910
industry is getting more regulated more

00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:44,240
professional we're actually turning this

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:48,640
into true standard body like Bluetooth

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,309
or USB so think of Pixar going forward

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,470
essentially as a bluetooth for drones

00:28:51,309 --> 00:28:57,380
poor comparison but kind of works so the

00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,099
goal is to specify all the key

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:03,320
components and interfaces correctly

00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:07,669
so that anyone can build to that spec

00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:10,459
and we can enable people to have flight

00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:13,219
controllers that can be mounted properly

00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:16,190
into drones with zero compatibility

00:29:13,219 --> 00:29:20,329
issues we can enable folks to have

00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:24,019
really easy-to-use gimbals that can be

00:29:20,329 --> 00:29:25,309
just snapped on and the hope is to

00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:28,190
really create the same plug-and-play

00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:30,950
experience that Bluetooth or USB offer

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:33,619
to end-users so it's not just about

00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:34,070
technical you know safety norms in

00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:37,070
anything

00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:40,549
the goal is interoperability with that

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:44,509
and the driving factor from a software

00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:46,489
perspective our MAV laying our px4 but

00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:48,709
really the standard is standalone so if

00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:50,929
you had a different software stack or

00:29:48,709 --> 00:29:53,029
proprietary implantation you can still

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:56,629
do that and that allows you for example

00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:59,329
to create a custom payload that is

00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:01,669
completely your product to interface to

00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:05,959
that standard and so it will work with

00:30:01,669 --> 00:30:08,749
all those px4 driven vehicles check it

00:30:05,959 --> 00:30:13,820
out on Pixar code org I will do a quick

00:30:08,749 --> 00:30:16,399
high-level overview now though so one of

00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:18,559
the core pieces is the autopilot bus

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,589
we've seen that many different companies

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,269
had many different auto pilots for me

00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:25,789
and autopilot having designed quite a

00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:27,950
few is actually not too complicated it's

00:30:25,789 --> 00:30:29,809
a microcontroller connected to three

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,440
sensors a bit of power management and

00:30:29,809 --> 00:30:34,159
that's about it

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,950
and the problems we have seen supporting

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,829
these different boards and regressions

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:42,229
and power supply issues and whatnot were

00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:45,109
horrendous compared to the inherent

00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:47,779
hardware complexity so the pattern over

00:30:45,109 --> 00:30:50,239
the last three to five years ever since

00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:52,219
we had more and more variants based on

00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:55,700
this old Pixar design and people didn't

00:30:52,219 --> 00:30:58,549
just re-implemented very core design we

00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,859
spend a lot of time on this so the

00:30:58,549 --> 00:31:05,479
solution to that is to standardize this

00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:08,269
much more closely so that we can

00:31:05,479 --> 00:31:11,629
guarantee that if you implement to the

00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:13,240
standard and you run px4 Anette it'll

00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:15,280
work it'll work every

00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,860
time you will not have weird power

00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,960
management power on power sequencing

00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:22,330
issues like we have seen them in the

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,660
past that's what this is about

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:31,690
so Pixar autopilot bus is specifying a

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:35,380
footprint for auto pilots and the

00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:35,920
matching standard for payloads for

00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:39,460
Gimbels

00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:43,120
is the payload interface standard Pixar

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:45,910
payload bus and that is essentially the

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,890
mechanical connector how you connect its

00:31:45,910 --> 00:31:50,620
add of the dovetail design how you

00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:54,430
connect the gimbal to the body of the

00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:58,120
drone it is the software which is

00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:01,720
specified as MAV link camera and gimbal

00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,890
payload protocol electricals we are

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:08,200
supporting USB and Ethernet and with

00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:11,800
that together you can really build a

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,200
completely standalone gimbal that is not

00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:18,100
related to any particular drone that

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:20,080
will work on a number of vendor systems

00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:22,510
and a first company going to market with

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,550
that standard is free fie based on what

00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:26,560
I'm seeing and I'm really excited about

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:29,050
that because this industry needs that

00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:32,470
there's way too much fragmentation and

00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:37,600
all the system integration engineering

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:39,880
work is cost for a lot of people in this

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,990
audience that doesn't add any value

00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,000
doesn't really further your business and

00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,890
is also sometimes a reason to not use

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,750
open source because as long as you have

00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:50,740
vendors that are vertically integrated

00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:54,040
like DGI

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:56,800
and it's just easy and it just works and

00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:59,170
you have a lineup of payloads you're

00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,970
going to go with that vendor even if the

00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,190
drone isn't exactly what you need

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,500
because you just have better choice

00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,830
taking the picture which is what really

00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,170
most people care about and so as you

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,850
approach this think again about it if

00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:14,980
you really needed your vertically

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:18,100
integrated special solution or if you

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:19,960
could just go with something that is a

00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,870
bit more standardized gives your

00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,000
customers more choice and maybe that's

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,500
driving in the end a lot more business

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,150
than going after the last

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:33,340
bit of specialization now for the

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,440
specific auto pilot to ensure that we

00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:37,870
can really run the software successfully

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,390
we also need to specify how exactly that

00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:44,110
autopilot is built internally not just a

00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:47,970
connector that's what these FMU for

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:50,920
flight management unit b5x b6x

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:53,110
documents and standards stand for the X

00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,700
at the end is actually indicating the

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:57,720
industrial version so that's the

00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:03,000
hardened design without X it's the more

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,530
developer enthusiast community version

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,050
we're targeting roughly one version per

00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:10,570
year we're on track with that with v5 x

00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:14,020
and v6 x and the cool thing is those two

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:18,040
designs are interchangeable on the pixar

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:21,429
autopilot bus good another important

00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:24,700
problem interfacing motors interfacing

00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:27,970
ESC is interfacing servos and other

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:30,730
actuators so that is something that

00:34:27,970 --> 00:34:34,060
we're attacking with a new can based

00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:35,350
interface standard think of it as Wi-Fi

00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:38,470
for drones

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,629
of course not Wireless but it's it's a

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,690
high-level spec that includes messaging

00:34:40,629 --> 00:34:45,129
includes authentication includes

00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:47,350
deployment and software upgrades so it's

00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:50,379
a lot more than just a transport layer

00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:52,690
and that's why it will sit on top of UAV

00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:56,379
can be one it's not on the same thing

00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:58,990
it's not competing its standardizing a

00:34:56,379 --> 00:35:03,970
message set and state machine on top of

00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:07,390
you V can v1 transport and check out the

00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:10,390
call from not call the talk from Peter

00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:14,710
and of course from Pebble who is also

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:16,600
giving us an update on UAV can good if

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:20,020
you're interested in standards there's a

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:24,250
panel on that next week yeah sorry

00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:27,430
tomorrow so check that out if you want

00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:29,380
to ask more questions follow the

00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:32,140
discussion they're looking forward to

00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,960
that then we're almost at the end of the

00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:40,090
presentation there's also an update on

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:43,240
how we do releases and roadmap

00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:47,740
in terms of releases Daniel and I talked

00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:50,640
about being kind of really stuck in this

00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:53,650
release stabilization process for weeks

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,540
because people come in with feedback but

00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,150
it takes quite a bit of time to test and

00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:01,420
then because the releases are really

00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:04,000
major steps major performance wins but

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:04,750
also API changes and kind of hard to

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,730
digest

00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:10,090
we want to make it simpler and easier to

00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:12,580
stay closer to the current version in

00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:15,780
upstream so there will be more frequent

00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:18,760
releases with gradual gentle changes

00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:21,130
that makes releases more predictable and

00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,510
easier to scope because we're not having

00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:27,730
this sort of big step and that should

00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,940
shorten the cycle between downstream

00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:34,270
adoption and feedback from companies

00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,610
using it that will also mean however

00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:39,100
that you will have these small

00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:41,140
increments all the time and so if you

00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:43,810
need something super stable you need to

00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:46,030
have your own strategy to stabilize that

00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:48,370
also API stabilize that if you want to

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,130
stay on an old release which might have

00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:54,010
been easier with the only two releases

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:56,470
per year up until now we believe this

00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:58,210
will tremendously accelerate our

00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:01,990
development it will allow us to bring

00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:04,060
improvements in faster and we think

00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:07,540
that's the right thing for the upstream

00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:09,520
project for individual products we

00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,550
believe that that's a responsibility of

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,370
each company to create those stable

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:17,590
releases for them if they if they want

00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:23,710
to freeze things you know on a longer

00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:26,200
time frame than that good then one last

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:32,230
slide one thing we really don't want to

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:35,440
do is to commit to specifically on goals

00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,750
this is a meritocracy so it's

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,270
contributions done by individuals done

00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:43,060
by companies based on best effort based

00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:45,430
on when and if they have bandwidth

00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:48,880
available but this is roughly what we

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:51,690
know our developer community is going to

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,560
work through the remainder of the year

00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,130
we're changing the

00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,860
way that the EKF framework is derived to

00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:02,020
python to make it more approachable

00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:06,220
that's something that Roman initiated

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:08,140
and Paul is now on that as well so

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,240
that's really cool that hopefully opens

00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:12,670
up more contributions into our state

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,310
estimation framework we're working on

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:17,200
multi EKF support that is related to

00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:22,240
some of the industrial applications in

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:25,090
industrial drones much more component

00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:30,340
level testing again check out the talk

00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:35,080
from Julian or Julian about fault

00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:38,290
injection we have a new way to allocate

00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:42,610
control signals to multicopters and

00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:44,860
beetles which will allow us to develop

00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:48,370
the flight control architecture in a

00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:51,790
much more scalable fashion and then can

00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:55,600
is the other main part plus quite a bit

00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:57,610
of hardening clean up structure like in

00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,240
the commander navigator hardware in the

00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:03,280
loop testing all those things they're

00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,990
probably a dozen things I haven't

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,520
mentioned here there's a lot of work in

00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:09,130
computer vision a lot of work on

00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:10,900
autonomy but that is sort of in the

00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:15,780
wider ecosystem and these contributions

00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:19,270
will come in as they're ready cool so

00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:21,820
that was really what I wanted to get

00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:23,590
across now I'm looking forward to check

00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:27,690
out your questions in real time they're

00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:27,690
appearing on a screen in front of me so

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:36,070
first question how do you see the px4

00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:38,260
platform in upcoming years so I think

00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:42,100
and mostly talk to that but just let me

00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:45,180
recap we expected to continue to have

00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:49,120
all the properties for consumer drones

00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:51,790
also for recreational use we plan to

00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:53,500
invest into auto-tuning so it's more

00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:55,150
approachable in particular also to

00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,940
software developers who might not know

00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:00,790
how to tune a drone so the goal is to

00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:02,920
keep that foundation solid make it even

00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:05,020
more approachable but then a lot of

00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,190
effort is going into commercial

00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:10,369
industrial applications so it's about

00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:12,050
all the upcoming reliability

00:40:10,369 --> 00:40:16,640
requirements all the upcoming

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:19,250
regulations and there we will invest a

00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,950
lot of energy to make sure that px4

00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:26,329
continues to be the best base for a

00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:29,230
commercial drone product second question

00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:32,210
is px4 all about the software side I

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:35,150
would say the px4 ecosystem is not as

00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:39,200
I've shown you with pixhawk hardware

00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:40,760
standards px4 as sort of a project yes

00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,329
it's very focused on software and that

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:46,040
makes sense but you can see that in the

00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:49,220
whole ecosystem that we're supporting

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:52,940
with drone code it's it's very holistic

00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:55,099
it's full-stack how can Institute

00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,660
students get involved if the px4

00:40:55,099 --> 00:41:00,440
community I think the best way is to

00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:03,859
join slack our sak channel it's slack

00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:09,560
dot px4 dot IO you can get yourself an

00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:15,890
invite there and our forum which is disc

00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:17,720
or discussed px4 dot IO question new

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,000
company in the drone industry how can we

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:22,190
get started well that's a difficult

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,480
question because it's so open-ended it

00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,520
could mean anything

00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:29,109
do you need to find customers do you

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,550
wonder how you can work with px4

00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:34,990
probably just sent me a private slack

00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:38,780
message and and we can figure it out

00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:41,510
that's px4 of any plan to expand his

00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:43,849
market to other nations that's an

00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:46,220
interesting question so what I'm taking

00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:48,619
away from that is that you kind of think

00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:50,900
we're assuming px4 is like a vendor it's

00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,460
not it's an open source project it's in

00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,990
the internet so it's in any nation

00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:59,180
available and we're not expanding we're

00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:02,270
not pushing we're getting pulled in

00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,130
different adoptions because people just

00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:07,010
download the source code get successful

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:09,470
with it contribute back to it so the

00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:12,109
answer is we get in many different

00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:14,450
nations all the time because people are

00:42:12,109 --> 00:42:16,819
successfully using it

00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:18,980
what about certification are we working

00:42:16,819 --> 00:42:20,630
with FAA yes we're working with pretty

00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,610
much any regulatory and

00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,900
standardization body under the Sun we're

00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:26,060
working with the FAA on type

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,370
certification check out Chris Anderson's

00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,440
presentation in the program we're

00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:35,180
working with a as we're working with ASD

00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,740
Stan we're working with ASTM very deeply

00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,780
involved and typically that works

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:41,660
through individual companies that are

00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:48,320
core px4 contributors who are present in

00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:51,200
these standardization bodies is it

00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:53,750
accepted that automotive standards are

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,560
accepted by eeu regulators

00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:59,900
yes absolutely we also expect FAA to be

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:02,690
totally happy with that in fact you can

00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:06,290
prove that the automotive safety and

00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:12,620
integrity levels can be mapped to deal

00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:15,320
178 levels you can google for a SIL deal

00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,700
178 mapping and you can find documents

00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:19,790
that people actually have done it before

00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:22,550
so we're not just speculating this is

00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:30,530
based on other people successfully doing

00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:33,430
it good thank you for watching and

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:35,960
please enjoy the rest of the summit and

00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:37,730
then I'm looking forward to more great

00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,440
talks and meeting you in person
