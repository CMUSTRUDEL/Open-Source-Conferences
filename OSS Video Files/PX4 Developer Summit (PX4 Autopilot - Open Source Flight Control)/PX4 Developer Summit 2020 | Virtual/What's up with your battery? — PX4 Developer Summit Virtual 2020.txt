	Title: What's up with your battery?

Summary: The majority of PX4 autopilot users have built their own vehicles with batteries that do not possess a battery lifecycle management system. In this session, we will introduce the basic concepts behind a battery management system (BMS) and how it is integrated into PX4 via the SMBUS protocol. We will also review how the BMS manages the battery and demonstrate the utility of the proposed system.

The PX4 Developer Summit 2020 is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
