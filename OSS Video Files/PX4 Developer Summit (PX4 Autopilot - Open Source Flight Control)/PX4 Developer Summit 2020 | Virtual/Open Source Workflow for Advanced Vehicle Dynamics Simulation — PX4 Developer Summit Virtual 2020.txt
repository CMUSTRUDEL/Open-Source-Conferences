	Title: Open Source Workflow for Advanced Vehicle Dynamics Simulation

Summary: The Open Source community supports a wide variety of toolsets to enable software and hardware in the loop simulation including Gazebo, X-Plane, FlightGear, iMAVSim, AirSim, and RealFlight. Each of these tools has their specific applications and advantages. The presentation will focus on an open-source workflow including NASA open-source parametric geometry (OpenVSP), JSBSim, and integrations with front-end visualization such as FlightGear. The talk will conclude with a review of implementation options, applications (such as software validation), demonstration of a SITL solution for a 50 lb VTOL airframe, and opportunities for future development.

The PX4 Developer Summit 2020 is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
