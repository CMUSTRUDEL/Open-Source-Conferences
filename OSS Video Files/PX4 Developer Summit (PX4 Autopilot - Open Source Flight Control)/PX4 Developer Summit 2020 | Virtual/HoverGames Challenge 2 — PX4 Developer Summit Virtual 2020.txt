Galloway he's going to be joining us

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,240
from Prince Edward Island Canada

00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,429
he's a drone program leader NXP nxp is a

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,020
turncoat Goldmember mobile the NSB

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,090
mobile robotics team looks across the

00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,430
bread of semiconductor products from all

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,289
the NXP bust business lines this

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:25,080
includes automotive industrial medical

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:27,390
RF sensors and wireless city conductors

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:31,560
the team prepares the reference designs

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,960
for FM you can to wire Ethernet security

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,640
and companion computers horror games is

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,840
our flagship program which provides a

00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,520
complete open source hardware and

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,410
software design and interesting brittle

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,710
challenges to get people started in

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,890
development in drones and Rovers

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:51,140
community

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:53,760
please welcome Yin Galloway hi everyone

00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:56,789
I'm here from Prince Edward Island as

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:01,649
you can see my background let me just

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:10,100
share my screen and is that sharing well

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:12,150
Ramon all right there we go alright so

00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:14,600
for those of you who haven't seen

00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,549
there's been a few my colleagues earlier

00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,770
that mentioned what NXP Semiconductors

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,500
were a global semiconductor company and

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,600
one of our focus areas is in automotive

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,700
or a leader in the automotive industry

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,710
but of course industrial mobile smart

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,630
home smart city our parts tend to get

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,240
used in high reliability or long-life

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:38,640
parts of medical equipment those sorts

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,920
of things the mobile robotics team is is

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,229
a small team it started as a small drone

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,780
team and we were lucky enough to be able

00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,420
to focus on on that and we identified

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,790
px4 early on as the software we wanted

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,390
to focus on because it's a applicability

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:56,850
and ability to be commercialized as well

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,500
we since moved to expanded a little bit

00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,659
become a mobile robotics team we've

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,840
we've adapted some things like our NXP

00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,200
cup car to be able to use our flight

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,869
controllers and things like that

00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:13,710
px4 based components on vehicles we've

00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:17,070
also done experimental VTOL aircraft

00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:19,320
and delivery vehicles but really what we

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,790
as as Ramone said in the introduction we

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,330
really look across the entire spectrum

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,960
of components from nxp and to see what

00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:30,600
is applicable in the drone space and in

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,820
particular you know what what we know is

00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,680
the area of most interest or most

00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,810
concerned that where we can help is with

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,840
automotive functionally say functional

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:42,510
safety parts and that means ISO 26262

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,390
and a SIL which is an automotive safety

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,670
level part that included things like

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:51,750
onboard diagnostics and error correcting

00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:54,660
memory and really taking these you know

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,610
what is a mature let's say came up from

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,040
the hobby drone industry and making it

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,740
more mature and suitable for things like

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,860
bvl OS like like Chris was just talking

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:08,340
about one of the important things to men

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,440
to note is we don't build drones we'd

00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,910
only build reference designs now we do

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,560
sell a drone kit but I'll talk about

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:15,720
that later but you know we're not in the

00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,680
business of making these these kits were

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,690
we're in the business of selling

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,170
semiconductors and everything we're

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,180
doing here is to to help others work

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:28,080
with our components and get a jump start

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,930
in solutions for these is the space to

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,220
give you an idea of automotive-grade

00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:34,560
components just to give you a sort of a

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:35,850
block diagram I feel for that types of

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,760
things we're talking about this is an S

00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:43,110
32 s it's a it's a high it's a safety

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,600
based component that's meant for things

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,730
like got emotive drivetrain and you can

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,700
see right off it's quite a complex part

00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,730
it's got eight cores there's four

00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,340
lockstep cores so each of those has a

00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,060
backup over on the system block you can

00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,950
see things like built in self-test and

00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,020
these are the sorts of things that that

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,610
make automotive parts on automotive

00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,010
they're built very carefully the

00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,870
construction of the semiconductor is is

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,930
quite a bit different than say a

00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,480
cellphone type of part this particular

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,739
part has lots and lots of memory and I'm

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,030
not going to go over the part I'm just

00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,320
saying in general this is what you can

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,160
expect from an automotive grade

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,560
component and we're working to enable

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,090
those and particularly the drone team of

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,130
the mobile robotics team

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,880
is able to be the bridge and help manage

00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:35,070
the challenges of using a part like this

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:36,870
in a in a non automotive industry you

00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,490
know normally these are millions and

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,080
millions of pieces that get used and

00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,150
they're made by that they're being

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,590
worked on by automotive vendors and we

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,449
were able to make the bridge to much

00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:48,000
much smaller of course drone drone

00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:49,470
solutions one of the first things we did

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,490
is the mobile robotics team was built a

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:55,400
flight controller and this is a pretty

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,830
generic looking flight controller it's

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,300
got our px4 connectors and it's a not a

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:03,830
particularly small form-factor it's sort

00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:07,620
of same as a regular Pickstock fix hawk

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:09,810
the it's based on an FM u v4 design but

00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,660
we did add our own twist on a few few

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,960
components particularly of course can

00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:19,410
and future parts we can FD and included

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,810
but the first one that's quite a bit

00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,880
different is the TGA 11 oh no it's a two

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:25,260
hour Automotive Ethernet and that allows

00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,419
you to do have an Ethernet connection

00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:30,180
just to unshielded twisted pair wires

00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,910
very well suited for drones and Rovers

00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:35,070
and mobile robotics application another

00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,930
part we included it was a secure element

00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,020
and this was our first part and start

00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:41,250
introducing this and it allows it allows

00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,820
you to start experimenting and

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:46,590
developing on it so we had a flight

00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,820
controller and now he said well what if

00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,050
we're gonna have a flight controller

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,889
might as well have a drone so we built

00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:56,130
to put a drone kit together and it's a

00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:58,080
very complete and quite a decent size

00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:00,180
it's a 500 millimeter frame it's got

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,700
nice a nice space for additional

00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,330
components and made a complete

00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,800
development kit and when we had a

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,460
development kit we said well we should

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,889
maybe have a competition so that's when

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:16,770
horror games was born and it uses the

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:19,050
the drone development kit and we put

00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:21,720
forward a challenge and but it's a

00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:23,639
coding competition it's not a it's not a

00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,650
flying challenge or anything like that

00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,440
we're trying to encourage developers to

00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,539
get involved in the in px4 and grow the

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:34,110
community and get people trying new

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:37,340
things in the context of a drone so it

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:40,320
is open to basically everyone anywhere

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,860
and that means engineers coders

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,659
developer

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,800
we have students we have hist hobbyists

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,479
that are interested in learning a bit

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,379
more and and we've seen quite a lot of

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:51,330
activity as a result we give out prizes

00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:55,199
and our first competition was called

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,270
fight fires with flyers and the results

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,599
were quite surprising we had over a

00:06:57,270 --> 00:07:02,460
thousand people following ended up with

00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:04,439
about 50 submissions in the end and then

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,150
we ended up also internally inside of

00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,129
nxp getting quite a bit of interest and

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:12,479
I'll talk about some of those results as

00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:14,969
well so hover games is is meant to be an

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,039
ongoing competition as well so in the

00:07:14,969 --> 00:07:20,610
2019 contest it was called fight fires

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,889
with flyers the idea was to help in

00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:26,159
basically in any way a first responder

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:29,550
in in solving or helping in fighting

00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:30,719
fires or managing fires so you don't

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:32,729
want to take that literally we're not

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:34,229
talking about dropping water but how can

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,349
a drone help in this situation

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:40,139
and so our first winner was in Bakke got

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:42,000
involved in machine learning and it was

00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:45,029
looking for identifying people that

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,430
might be might be stuck in a

00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:49,849
catastrophic condition you know lost in

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,409
the woods etc and so they implemented

00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:56,969
machine learning and cooperated with the

00:07:52,409 --> 00:08:00,719
drone over you know MAV link

00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:02,580
communication and in implemented machine

00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:06,259
learning with an additional companion

00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:08,370
computer our second-place winner was

00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:11,460
interesting as well they equipped the

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:14,669
drone with very very sort of

00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,430
off-the-shelf few more chemical sensors

00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:19,080
and they use that to determine what type

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,199
of fire was so it would help in the

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,759
response we had a number of special

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,659
awards one of them was a drone coder

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,569
award and that's where they literally

00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:33,029
created heat maps and I particularly

00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:35,880
like like this because it showed the

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:38,459
idea of you know a drone a few hundred

00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,060
dollar drone and a very inexpensive heat

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:45,060
sensor ending up generating pretty good

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,800
results in terms of resolution and and

00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,850
sensing capability you can see the heat

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,430
maps there's actually two different

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,930
teams that did something similar but by

00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,089
flying a grid pattern you were able to

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,040
easily detect a small

00:08:54,089 --> 00:08:57,870
coal's or embers or hot spots in the

00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,899
ground and so it's actually very

00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:02,939
practical that instead of having a you

00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,499
know quite an expensive drone a first

00:09:02,939 --> 00:09:06,720
responder a fire department anywhere

00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:11,069
could have one or more of these going

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,259
out and searching for hot spots the

00:09:11,069 --> 00:09:15,329
second place I'll just I won't go into

00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,550
all the detail here but you know we were

00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:19,319
impressed with the quick jump to machine

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,209
learning that people did and so this

00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,910
this had a several several different

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:27,149
sensors theory again also very low cost

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:31,160
devices and built a machine learning

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:33,480
model to detect what type of fire it was

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:35,819
another unusual one and quite

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,569
interesting was lightning detection

00:09:35,819 --> 00:09:41,399
system so by adding a lightning detector

00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:43,589
specialized IC with some

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,999
microcontrollers another LPC micro from

00:09:43,589 --> 00:09:49,589
nxp and and and other other components

00:09:46,999 --> 00:09:51,360
you would detect lightning strikes and

00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,100
then as you get a frequency of lightning

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,290
strikes over a certain amount the drone

00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,759
was would be able to go out and inspect

00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:58,470
to see if there's a fire that needs

00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:02,069
attention or if something had happened

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,220
as a result so it was quite inspiring

00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:06,660
that there's lots of different unusual

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:11,370
examples here and then one of our

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:13,199
internal participants did work with our

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:15,329
ultra wideband parts we have some new

00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:16,589
ultra wideband parts that are quite out

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,839
to the market but they were able to use

00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:22,319
it for the beginnings of precision

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:23,699
landing by having anchors and doing sort

00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:28,759
of millimeter or centimeter level

00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,759
precision for locating drones in space

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:33,540
now for the next hover games I said

00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:37,709
these are ongoing challenges is not

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:40,589
one-off we are we were gonna do a search

00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:42,899
and rescue type of affair and of course

00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:45,029
the pandemic hit so we thought it only

00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,399
appropriate be a little insensitive to

00:10:45,029 --> 00:10:50,699
not to do something completely obtuse to

00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:52,980
that so we pivoted and said let's let's

00:10:50,699 --> 00:10:56,819
do called help drones help others during

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:59,910
pandemics and so we're looking at what

00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:02,309
interesting ways can we use drones to

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,170
help other people during pandemics and

00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:05,790
that could be you know like what can you

00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,710
learn as people get isolated there's

00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:11,250
medicines that people need there's

00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:13,380
moving blood samples from a hospital to

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:15,120
a test lab there's a lot of really

00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:17,339
innovative ways and it does build upon

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,140
the first fight fires with flyers where

00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:20,610
there's there was a lot of Technology

00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,649
you know extending radio coverage

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:24,930
networks and at any time there's a

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,120
pandemic or a disaster situation

00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,010
sometimes there's a need for a lot of

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,790
infrastructure or support for first

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:33,870
responders and that sort of thing and so

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:36,120
you know we're thinking how can we help

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,620
people in any way we're quite flexible

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,649
on that it doesn't you know it can be

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,360
quite a narrow focus and it can be quite

00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,990
deep in terms of focusing on a

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,330
particular software enable meant as well

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:51,899
so we operate the contest through

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:53,370
hackster IO and so it that applications

00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:55,200
are running until the end of July and

00:11:53,370 --> 00:12:00,959
the contest runs all the way up until

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:04,020
November in promotion for this for this

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,600
video we did a we did a flight YouTube

00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:09,000
video with flight test and that was a

00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,270
lot of fun one of the things we did was

00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,880
we built a we actually built a tail

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:17,279
sitter VTOL aircraft with the normal

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,610
flight test build foam board build

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:22,470
methods and it's completely experimental

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,190
that was a lot of fun and we do want to

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:28,890
work on it some more to develop it

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:30,390
further but the thought here was you

00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,860
know we had an opportunity to do

00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:33,360
something interesting maybe there's

00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,250
people in px4 community that would

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,220
appreciate a low-cost

00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:41,000
VTOL tail sitter so that actually is now

00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,980
they're making it available for sale and

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,110
you know we the the important thing is

00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:49,080
also that it attracts a large audience

00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:50,820
to px4 development as well this has

00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,279
already been seen it's only been out for

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,900
a few days and we're up to over a

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,270
hundred and twenty thousand people have

00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:01,430
viewed this video which means they've

00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:01,430
all been introduced in some way to px4

00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:11,550
so in in hover games - we are in now

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,970
introducing a companion computer it's

00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,150
based on an IDOT MX processor an IDOT MX

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:21,480
8 M mini and we're calling this board a

00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:24,930
nav you it's a little stack up of boards

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:26,940
it is experimental it is new but you

00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:31,650
know we're enabling things like the

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:37,590
vision OpenCV the there's a camera on

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:39,330
board GStreamer Ross and you know that

00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:41,760
this will grow over time we'll do some

00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:44,370
rapid iterations on code as we determine

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,810
what people want to see on a companion

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:50,760
pewter it is actually for people that

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,560
have already started the been in the

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,170
first hover games I again it's only a

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,500
$50 adder it's quite an amazing discount

00:13:55,170 --> 00:14:01,500
that we were able to provide on a

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,090
processor board of this caliber it's

00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,640
basically a stack up of three boards

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:08,340
this Psalm on the far left is a system

00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,790
on module Assam that that is a more or

00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:13,890
less a duplicate of our normal evk

00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:18,030
Psalms and evaluation kits that we make

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:21,930
for this processor includes emmc memory

00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:24,030
it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth the center

00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:26,100
board breaks out the camera interface a

00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:28,340
display interface and an SD card for

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:30,750
your code and then on the far right is a

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:36,540
really what makes it hover games board

00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:40,560
is all the px4 connectors and UART spy

00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:43,350
ports etc so we can communicate with as

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,930
a companion computer has a USB sea-based

00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:48,510
power input so you get six 220 volt

00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,340
input and we leverage that also can be

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:55,380
connected directly to the battery of the

00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:56,610
drone we also include the HDMI adapter

00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,500
so if you wanted to use it as a little

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:00,870
mini desktop you could and a Google

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,760
choral camera and I'll mention over here

00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,040
on this slide we're introducing a new

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,900
form factor called an IX industrial

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,600
ethernet and you can see the reason is

00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:13,500
it's quite nice and small these are made

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:17,910
by hero Z and this makes it possible to

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:22,800
have a an rj45 connector for on a drone

00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:25,200
which is a replacement for an rj45 so to

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,790
join or find out more these are

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,740
basically the links you might want to

00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:31,830
follow that you can follow you can get

00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:33,150
to it anytime through hover Gamescom we

00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:35,040
do like to partner with other companies

00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,510
as well so you can

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,670
you can look at that and you contact us

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,290
there but however Gamescom will get you

00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:42,560
to the right place and then we do have a

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:44,790
specific registration play a page

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,070
there's a user guide on get books it

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,050
shows you all about how we how to build

00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:52,010
so I got step-by-step guides and videos

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:55,110
and then we have a list of different

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:57,090
compatible px4 drone hardware on this

00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:59,850
page hover games drone and we can

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:04,950
discuss things also on the px4 it's a

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:06,750
hashtag cover game slack channel now I

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,850
just want to talk about some of the new

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,020
developments in from the nxp mobile

00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:11,730
robotics team because these these

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:17,940
developments move into the next hover

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:23,880
games and and what you know what's

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:26,250
coming up so let's just jump in so nav q

00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,450
and and now okay so for the first time

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,500
our games we did introduce some new

00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:30,510
things we have the opportunity to build

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,790
some new hardware and we had this little

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:35,160
project product called a rapid IOT

00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:37,440
module that's the blue part and so we

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,470
were able to make a adapter board for

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:45,170
that that would allow the rapid IOT

00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:47,490
module to take these clique modules oops

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:50,400
click-click modules that can add lots of

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:51,060
sensors there's over 400 of them and I'm

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,240
sorry about that

00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:56,400
and then we ported Mavs link to it and

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,370
so it allowed new experimentation with

00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,750
this the IMX 8 a mini that we're

00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:04,650
introducing has a lot of interesting

00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:07,130
features it has the ones I've

00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:10,260
highlighted here it's a it's a that's a

00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:14,699
quad core a 53 so it's a Linux computer

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:18,300
Campania computer running at a 1.2

00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:22,250
gigahertz the it has hardware encoders

00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:25,860
for video it has one mipi CSI camera

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,600
lane and then introduces Gigabit

00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:30,180
Ethernet on board as well as other

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:34,460
things that you know are available on

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,870
the chip so USB 2.0 and and PCIe etc

00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:40,430
this is already used in a number of

00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:43,590
other commercial drone applications

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:46,080
later this year we'll introduce an 8 m+

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,890
and I'm quite excited about this one

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,620
this

00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,299
the biggest claim to fame here is that

00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:56,100
we introduce machine learning

00:17:51,299 --> 00:18:00,870
accelerator so this is a design to

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:04,190
accelerate neural nets and operating

00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:06,780
about 2.3 tops it has again the quad a53

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,900
processor core it does have a secondary

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:13,260
m7 core that could be used we have

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:15,990
hardware encoders for video again this

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:18,960
time it does h.265 and wide dynamic

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:23,340
range encoding and then has a dual

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,990
camera interface which allows for with

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,610
an isp so it allows for things like D

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,770
warping and D Bayer patterning and

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,160
hardware and with dual cameras we can

00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:35,850
add things like a both a front and rear

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,100
camera or a time-of-flight camera and a

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,690
regular camera the other thing that's

00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,480
quite exciting here is the connectivity

00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:44,610
so we've now got can FD onboard which

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,360
support of course will support you a you

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:51,270
can one quite nicely two Gigabit

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,580
Ethernet ports and that's also being

00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,380
seen as terms of a connection to payload

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,110
buses and things like that and then two

00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:59,730
USB 3.0 which means if you were to use

00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,130
this as a camera head you've got a nice

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,870
high speed USB interface that you could

00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,530
use or of course you can pipe it out

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:11,130
over Ethernet and lots of other features

00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:13,380
of cohere I can't won't go into the

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,540
important thing to remember or look out

00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:17,850
here is these are embedded these are

00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:20,179
edge compute devices and the idea is

00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,350
unlike some of the other processors we

00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:24,000
have optimized this so it's it's

00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:26,730
typically running at a two or three

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,669
watts and when it our current

00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,010
measurements today is when it's running

00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:33,870
flat out it so it's only a 5 watt device

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:36,630
so it means that you're you can have

00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,640
multiple of these onboard or and you're

00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:44,100
not gonna require large heat sinks to

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:46,200
weigh down a drone another new focus for

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,450
the mobile robotics team is to use s 32

00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:50,160
K these are some automotive

00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,690
microcontrollers in some ways I kind of

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,770
think of them as pickup trucks you know

00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,530
they're not not all that sexy but they

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,640
are rugged and they're automotive grade

00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:02,380
microcontrollers so these are

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,929
or our cores running at a hundred odd

00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,970
megahertz and this is what we've been

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:09,700
using in some of our new products to

00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,220
give you this sort of entry automotive

00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,280
reliability in sensors and peripherals

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,750
and to that end okay so another part

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,210
we've also been adding is our latest

00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,960
sort of flagship secure element called

00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:28,660
SC zero five zero and we're a large

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,480
supplier to many passports and credit

00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,640
cards and you know bus tokens and things

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,710
like that worldwide so these are the

00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,040
same sorts of components that are in in

00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:43,570
those parts it's a got a huge number of

00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:45,669
different key and cryptographic tools

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:50,080
that are associated with it and by

00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:54,160
adding these two to a drone it allows us

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:59,799
to include authentication of modules of

00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:01,929
sub modules and then also you know be

00:20:59,799 --> 00:21:03,850
used for cryptographic key storage so if

00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:06,460
you're trying to let's say give

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:09,669
authorization to fly a drone to only to

00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:11,620
the the firefighter that is supposed to

00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:12,970
operate the drone or that someone has to

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:14,980
have a certain level of authorization

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,809
before they're allowed allowed to fly

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,630
around in a certain way then that could

00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:22,929
be managed through keys that are stored

00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:24,900
in a secure element and in we get these

00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:27,549
are used all over the place in terms of

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:32,559
industrial authentication and

00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:34,120
commissioning commissioning of IOT

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,100
devices and connecting in different

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,750
networks

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:40,600
one of the first products to include

00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:43,600
this as we had a call presentation

00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,790
earlier here in the summit for you ad

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:49,570
can or and we call have this board a

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:52,110
little node generic you can board which

00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,400
lets you break out the UAV can and go to

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,970
traditional interfaces like UART I

00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,640
squared C spy an RC PWM so you could

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,070
have a build yourself a UAV can

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,320
connected motor controller and prototype

00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,960
experiment very quickly with a small

00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:10,510
simple low-cost board and and these

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,140
designs that we do are completely

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:14,090
open-source I grew their there

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:15,920
the software is open-source based on px4

00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:18,440
and of course the hardware designs are

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:24,440
completely open source and available for

00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:25,850
download from us block diagram here we

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:28,730
include the secure element which has a

00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:30,770
optional and a C interface on the right

00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,690
where you could maybe tap a card and or

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:37,600
tap it to another part of the drone to

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:40,640
in it allow it to join the same network

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,240
dual can FD so now we can start looking

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,770
at a UAV can application and then yeah

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,870
fairly straightforward there's not a lot

00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:50,809
of a lot of interesting a lot of a lot

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:55,100
of complex things here so it's very

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:56,630
flexible another board that we've also

00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:59,030
included these microcontrollers and

00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:01,070
secure element on well actually a

00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,290
different secure element is our battery

00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:07,270
management reference design this is

00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:09,110
enabled in px4 as well and we also

00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,820
included a slightly different

00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:14,540
authentication and component so even

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:16,820
less expensive one often used in in

00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:19,040
consumable components but it has the

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,929
ability to do things like flag if you

00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,419
had an abusive condition like an on a

00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:26,000
severe under voltage or severe over

00:23:23,419 --> 00:23:28,280
temperature you might burn or set a flag

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,140
in the authentication component that is

00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:33,410
permanent you can also permanently

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,429
account cycles and with that sort of

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:37,340
thing

00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:39,049
you know under certain flight

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:40,220
requirements you might need to do that

00:23:39,049 --> 00:23:42,890
and might need to be able to prove that

00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:46,880
this particular battery pack only has so

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:48,620
many cycles on it and again another this

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,260
completely open source reference design

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:57,020
and it's able to scale up to quite a

00:23:51,260 --> 00:24:01,580
high battery power current I think over

00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:03,140
ninety amps capable another one is a

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,790
media converter so we said we have these

00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:06,919
two wire automotive Ethernet on our

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,540
flight controller in order to connect to

00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:11,000
that you need a two wire Automotive

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,500
Ethernet converter so we built one this

00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,150
is meant to be like a little dongle and

00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:16,460
it would allow you to connect say over

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:20,000
to that companion computer

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,679
the Navi u companion computer and again

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,980
this is applicable in all sorts of other

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,810
areas as well if you just want to try

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:29,180
to our Ethernet you could get two of

00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:31,820
them and plug two computers together and

00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,410
see how it performs

00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:35,180
we decided also build an automotive

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,710
grade Ethernet switch so we have a

00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,830
naught n board Ethernet switch

00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:42,050
automotive component so put this down on

00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:45,710
a board a small 50 millimeter by 70

00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,840
millimeter 75 millimeter and with six of

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:51,410
these to our automotive Ethernet ports a

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:54,050
hunter base TX port and an IX industrial

00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:56,570
out of gigabit port so this will be used

00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:59,330
for this will be available for anyone to

00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,890
use but also you know may incorporate

00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:03,260
some of these things in the future hover

00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:04,850
games and then finally I mentioned the

00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,900
precision landing we've continued to do

00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:10,730
development on that and we're working

00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:13,220
towards to being able to land a drone

00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:15,680
two centimeter accuracy on a moving

00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:17,390
platform with our ultra wideband board

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,820
some of these things are internal at the

00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:21,830
moment but once we get a code developed

00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,210
a certain amount a certain level we'll

00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:26,030
be able to make this publicly available

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:30,170
for the generic general px4 community

00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,700
and that's our sort of ecosystem it

00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,350
looks a bit messy but it's growing very

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,360
quickly there's lots of different

00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:37,700
components both we're developing as

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,160
reference designs and that third parties

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:44,600
have used our components in things like

00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:47,840
even a DSB RF transponders for for

00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,880
vehicles so they use our LD mas RF power

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,950
amplifiers we've got third-party

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:55,180
companies building motor control high

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,230
reliability motor control yesyes with a

00:25:55,180 --> 00:26:00,950
I'm IMX

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:02,420
RT and s 32 K parts and we'll be

00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:04,580
continuing to fill this out with other

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:08,750
other solutions that people can use as

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:10,280
reference points so back to hover games

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,840
which is what I'm talking about here

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,790
why should I join hover games if I'm

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,530
already at working on P explore well

00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:17,120
first of all this prizes so that's a

00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,010
good thing you can get paid or if you

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,420
win you can make a little bit of money

00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:24,470
to support your your investment in time

00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:25,880
but it might just be the incentive you

00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,510
needs to test or implement a new

00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,220
application idea it also gets you FCC

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:33,170
seee approved hardware this is all

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:36,070
approved Hardware

00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:39,580
passed all the regulatory requirements

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,080
unlike some hobby level grade stuff it

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,999
is a complete kit it concludes

00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:46,179
everything but the lithium lithium

00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:49,779
polymer battery radio controller is

00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:53,049
included telemetry is included those

00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:54,850
sorts of things you get access to some

00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:57,759
of these new hardware features to try

00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:59,799
you might be interested in in encryption

00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:02,049
or to our Ethernet or UAV can and this

00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,940
is hard this hardware has it active and

00:27:02,049 --> 00:27:06,009
is able to test and use it right away

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:07,239
and then the other reason you might

00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:08,590
maybe you don't want to join yourself

00:27:07,239 --> 00:27:10,570
but you might want to promote it to

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,099
others in order to help grow the px4

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:13,659
community and the bigger the community

00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:16,899
is and the more people developing in the

00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:19,599
space the better it is for everyone so

00:27:16,899 --> 00:27:23,429

join hover games yeah am I on the right

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:42,900

00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:47,640
yeah how to join go to either WWF or

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:49,070
Gamescom or you go to this hackster

00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,860
length the direct hackster link which is

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:58,800
hacks trio contests hover games - and

00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:01,020
what you do is you you basically write a

00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:03,750
little profile of what your idea is and

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,920
share it and and that's the application

00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:10,040
in order to to be judged if you if you

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:14,040
sort of win the application round

00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:15,600
awesome and can anyone join yes anyone

00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,400
can draw it join I mean I think there

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,570
are a couple of restrictions in terms of

00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,390
certain countries we're not allowed to

00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:27,020
ship - but yes anyone can join students

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:31,200
engineers professionals if your

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:34,760
employees of NXP aren't eligible for the

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,760
prizes but we do have an internal

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:41,430
contest that these get follows the same

00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:45,140
track awesome and lastly what less are

00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:48,630
you running on the IMA hey the IM x8 +

00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:51,570
so we're going to be making a couple of

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,970
options available normally our customers

00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,230
are deeply embedded right so they

00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:59,460
actually want to build a stripped-down

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,290
basically usually an open embedded

00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:02,400
kernel or something like that so it's

00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,350
very focused and so what we've been

00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:06,930
trying to put together for this is a

00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:08,250
friendly linux of sorts it's sort of a

00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,460
debian-based Linux and we'll have a

00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:13,680
couple of flavors of that we do expect

00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:18,240
some challenges there but we're making

00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:22,640
great progress awesome thank you for
