Title: PX4, an autonomous drone competition, an octocopter, and a bunch of high schoolers. What could go wrong?

Summary: We will be talking about how we first learned about and started using PX4 and the Dronecode ecosystem (including Pixhawk, PX4, and MAVLink) and our experiences working with the open-source community and open-source software. Additionally, we will share some background information on our club, as well as our progress up to this point and forwards as we enter the AUVSI SUAS autonomous drone competition next year. Finally, we will talk about our future plans; how we are continuing to contribute to the open-source community and some fun projects we hope to do in the future.
