	The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd

Title: PX4, an autonomous drone competition, an octocopter, and a bunch of high schoolers. What could go wrong?

Summary: We will be talking about how we first learned about and started using PX4 and the Dronecode ecosystem (including Pixhawk, PX4, and MAVLink) and our experiences working with the open-source community and open-source software. Additionally, we will share some background information on our club, as well as our progress up to this point and forwards as we enter the AUVSI SUAS autonomous drone competition next year. Finally, we will talk about our future plans; how we are continuing to contribute to the open-source community and some fun projects we hope to do in the future.

[Music]

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,390
with our autonomous octocopter we're

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,640
preparing for an international

00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:22,800
competition designing and testing custom

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,449
components participating in a global

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:30,689
community of developers in the industry

00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:32,969
and we're all still in high school how

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,800
did we get here back in the middle of

00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:36,540
2018 I was looking for a Robotics

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,520
Competition when I found the student

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,170
unmanned aerial systems a competition in

00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,850
Maryland where high school and college

00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,620
teams develop autonomous UAV that

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:45,600
competes in various tasks such as

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,520
autonomous Waypoint navigation image

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,620
recognition obstacle avoidance and

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,270
payload drop so I got a few friends

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,820
together and we started a new Club

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,129
ammeter UAVs at the time we were a small

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,750
group but as we took on more members the

00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:02,100
club started to gain traction we were

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,400
eager to get started so we immediately

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,020
began to design and construct a plane we

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,909
were on a tight budget and looking for a

00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:11,220
challenge so we initially dismissed the

00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:15,659
possibility of a multi rotor truthfully

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:25,320
this was a pretty big mistake we are

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:26,939
launching our plane kelex zero well many

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,950
of us had the previous RC experience

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,040
none of us had attempted anything of a

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:36,849
skill we were hoping to accomplish

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,849
[Music]

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,260
after more than a couple of failed

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,060
attempts with the plane we eventually

00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:49,870
decided to transition to a basic

00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:51,340
multicopter design our entire design

00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:53,350
principle has constantly been based on

00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:55,120
our extremely tight budget this approach

00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,710
was initially unsuccessful from cheap

00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:01,630
motors with bad bearings so generously

00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:02,860
unstable 3d printed frame soon after we

00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:13,160
began running into issues

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:16,020
[Music]

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,180
discouraged and irritated our motivation

00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,340
vanished after taking a short break and

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,830
doing some research we discovered the

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,890
holy bro s 500 and it was conveniently

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,660
on a suspiciously good sale we put our

00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:30,130
pride aside and bought it and this is

00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:35,080
when we found out about px4

00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:38,260
[Music]

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,000
and then for the first time ever almost

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,730
everything was going smoothly Oh God

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,390
[Applause]

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,390
well someone

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,870
[Music]

00:02:51,620 --> 00:03:10,620
and we have pretty stable liftoff

00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:10,620
[Music]

00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,150
we've always preferred to use

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,920
open-source technologies as much as

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:17,209
possible in our work we came across

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,280
drone code which seemed to be a

00:03:17,209 --> 00:03:21,500
full-stack solution for autonomous

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,330
drones while being fully open source at

00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:25,069
the same time we were also struggling to

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:41,090
control our UAV properly without a pilot

00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:42,769
so we decided to give px4 a shop px4

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,569
enabled us to continue developing our

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:47,390
small test platform we simultaneously

00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:49,310
designed the large-scale multi rotor we

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,660
chose to use a hexacopter as we would

00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,410
have extra motors for more payload

00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,600
capacity

00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,700
after months of development we finally

00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,170
had the design the fabrication of the

00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:59,690
carbon fiber was well over our budget

00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,150
stuck in a trap a well-timed donation of

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:03,650
a coaxial quadcopter from a production

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,269
company to the school's engineering

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:07,400
department allowed us to move on with

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:09,799
development after spending several days

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,420
adventuring and transporting parts we

00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,290
turned our focus to preparing this drone

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,290
for the competition

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:38,629
[Music]

00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:40,400
our challenge was to accommodate many of

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,229
our electronics and mechanisms onto a

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,419
filming truck all while spending as

00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:45,860
little money as possible we converted it

00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:48,139
to an octocopter for greater efficiency

00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,370
and started making other modifications

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,740
to get the frame ready for the

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,300
competition some scrap plywood and laser

00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,699
cutting resulted in our temporary

00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,520
electronics me holding a Jetson Nano the

00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,130
CUA vv5 Plus autopilot and two GPS

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,990
receivers a winch system and an antenna

00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,509
were attached to the arms along with our

00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:09,669
main camera our new multi rotor a macron

00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:09,669
was our first real success as a club

00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,070
since px4 is incredibly reliable and

00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,870
easy-to-use out-of-the-box any problems

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:26,030
with the way macron flew were solely due

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,280
to mechanical issues or imperfect bid

00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:30,020
values this allowed our team to isolate

00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:31,370
and systematically alter specific

00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,470
variables that could cause certain

00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:36,130
problems effectively improving the way

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,130
macron flew

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:46,729
[Music]

00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:48,860
we benefited immensely from the vibrant

00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:51,229
and active px4 community over the years

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,179
having an accessible friendly online

00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,369
community has allowed us to gain

00:05:53,179 --> 00:05:57,259
industry knowledge and connections while

00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:59,449
also providing a direct line of support

00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:02,149
for testing and improving the px4 flight

00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:04,159
stack because of px4 is free and open

00:06:02,149 --> 00:06:05,389
source nature we've been able to both

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:07,669
benefit from the work of other

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:12,379
volunteers while also giving back and

00:06:07,669 --> 00:06:12,870
contributing our own improvements we're

00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:22,210
ready

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:24,620
[Music]

00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:27,230
right now we're still working hard to

00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,390
prepare for the 2021 suas competition

00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:31,280
all those cancelled this year we've

00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,130
dedicated more time to developing the

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,170
drone in both hardware and software just

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,240
recently we redesigned our winch system

00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,580
after testing several designs and is now

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,590
capable of dropping payloads using a

00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:44,600
prototype driver system we were finally

00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:48,370
able to control the drop mechanism in

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,370
the descent of the payload sorta

00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:01,060
[Music]

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:13,460
[Applause]

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:15,680
[Music]

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,760
although the driver system was unrefined

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,470
and needs some work

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,210
we hope to soon update it with less

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:21,960
messy wiring and make the electronics

00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,889
more compact

00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:28,809
[Music]

00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:30,909
our onboard computer and Wi-Fi system

00:07:28,809 --> 00:07:32,709
have made significant progress and we're

00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:34,869
working to improve those systems during

00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:36,429
the coming months advancements have been

00:07:34,869 --> 00:07:37,959
made in getting a stable Wi-Fi

00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:40,119
connection to the drone for relaying

00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:41,979
images recently we've also made

00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:44,169
significant improvements to establish a

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,909
live video and image feed between our

00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:48,999
drones main camera and our ground

00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:50,709
station an antenna tracker system is in

00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:52,719
the works as well which uses gimbal

00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:54,939
light controls to precisely Point an

00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,860
antenna directing a stable strong Wi-Fi

00:07:54,939 --> 00:07:59,019
connection to macron over long distances

00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:00,879
in addition we are we're planning to

00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,099
open-source the antenna tracking control

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,169
code as a px4 module we have also been

00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,089
working on our MAV sdk-based navigation

00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:08,800
system called pilot we are currently

00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:11,050
working on adding area survey and

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,789
obstacle avoidance functionality we are

00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,469
also working on integrating winch and

00:08:12,789 --> 00:08:16,800
unmanned ground vehicle control into

00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:16,800
pilot

00:08:19,619 --> 00:08:23,619
there are also some major problems with

00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,629
macron such as an inadequate battery

00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:27,489
life a competition requires us to be

00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:31,319
flying for a minimum of 30 minutes a

00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:31,319
macron can only hover for 20

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,740
[Music]

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,479
during a recent test flight we lost

00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:43,459
track of time while hovering during a

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,209
Wi-Fi link test and our batteries were

00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:46,209
not fully charged

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:50,610
[Music]

00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:59,279
luckily the damage was surprisingly

00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:01,170
minimal we were able to rebuild macron

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,200
in two days but battery life is still a

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,250
concern with our old and worn batteries

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,020
we're planning to remove unnecessary

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,240
weight from the frame and gradually

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:13,410
replace our motors and batteries as soon

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,600
as our budget permits since the spring

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,790
of 2019 our club's goal has not changed

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,899
but has taken on a broader aspect one

00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,700
aspect that we have recently

00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,380
incorporated into our club's goal is to

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,390
give back to our community going forward

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,339
we have many things planned for the club

00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:28,170
as part of our effort to embrace open

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:29,520
source we will be publishing parts of

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,140
our code base as well as integrating

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,390
some of the features we have developed

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,760
into mainstream px4 Mavs Lync and MAV

00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:37,589
SDK one project I'm looking forward to

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,940
is something we call beekeeper it's an

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:41,760
attempt to write a map link in MAV

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,380
sdk-based drunk Swan control system if

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,149
this works out we hope to feature this

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,610
in the demonstration or show later this

00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:49,110
year or next year with our drone we plan

00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,300
to spread knowledge about the industry

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,190
currently we are working on hosting

00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,810
technology conferences and Jones shows

00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,240
which hopefully will benefit our

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,890
community along with these projects we

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,570
are also targeting kids younger than us

00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,670
to further their knowledge and aerial

00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:04,589
vehicles in order to spark their

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,959
interest in this field through hosting

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:08,700
hackathons and fairs hopefully

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,110
interested students will succeed us in

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,920
our clubs as our high school journey

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:12,920
comes to an end

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:22,899
[Music]

00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:32,710
I think in the end us having the

00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,880
opportunity to build such a strong

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:35,680
relationship with the open-source

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,160
community is really what's going to keep

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,160
us moving forward

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:53,070
[Music]

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,620
thank you to the PX or community for

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,240
helping us with our flight stack and to

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,030
all of our generous sponsors for your

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,010
contributions for ambitious projects the

00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,300
relationships we have developed the help

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:07,350
we've received and the support we've

00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,240
been given from the open source

00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:11,250
community has really given us more

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,760
reasons to continue and that's what

00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,760
we're going to do

00:11:14,180 --> 00:12:02,880
