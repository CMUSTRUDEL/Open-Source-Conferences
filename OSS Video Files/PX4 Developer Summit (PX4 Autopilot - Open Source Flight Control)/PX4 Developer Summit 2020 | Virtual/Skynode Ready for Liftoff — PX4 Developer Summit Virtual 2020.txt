	Title: Skynode Ready for Liftoff

Summary: It's been two months since we announced Skynode and now we're getting ready for liftoff. In this 4-minute lightning talk we will recap why we think Skynode is the next big thing after Pixhawk and introduce our early access program.

hi

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,800
my name is lauren i'm head of product

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,799
marketing here at ottarium

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,280
and i hope you have enjoyed the first

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,359
part of the px4 dev summit

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,000
i'm super excited to see how many tuned

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,640
in to attend this year's event

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,519
two months ago here in this room our

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,840
co-founder

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,039
lawrence meyer announced the next big

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,880
thing after pixhawk

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,800
many of you probably attended the

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,800
webinar back then but let's quickly

00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,840
[Music]

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
recap

00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:20,430
[Music]

00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:27,310
[Music]

00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:39,070
[Applause]

00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:39,070
[Music]

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,360
so why do we think skynode is the next

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,159
big thing after pixhawk

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,840
it's for three main reasons number one

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,159
is the combination of components

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
that are integrated here in this compact

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,040
module

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,360
it's first and foremost the flight

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,360
controller which is based

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,360
on the next gen fmu v5x

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,640
there is also a connectivity module

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
built into skynode

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
and there's a mission computer an imx

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,840
aqm that runs the autonomy engine

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
the payload manager that enables video

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
streaming

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,720
enables security with a secure

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
bootloader and that allows you to run

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,239
your own code

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,720
onboard your drone giving you complete

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,879
freedom to operate

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,760
all of this is embedded in this compact

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,120
design

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,640
that comes with or without enclosure and

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,280
that fits even into small systems

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,000
the second reason why skynode stands out

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,920
is that it's not

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
just the hardware that we're going to

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,959
deliver to you but also the

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,959
pre-installed software

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,519
which is on one hand the complete flight

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,440
control stack based on px4

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,440
and on the other hand it's our operating

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,599
system that runs on the mission computer

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,319
and enables all the functionality that i

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,440
mentioned before

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,239
you can use mav sdk to work in a known

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,560
development

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,239
environment and leverage the mission

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,440
computer for your own advanced

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,040
functionality

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,720
on the drone the third reason

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
why skynode is special is the

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,920
connectivity the fact that skynode

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,800
brings your drones

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,680
online allowing you real-time data

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
transmission for

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
telemetry or eventually data captured by

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,319
your payloads

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,680
that means for your commercial end users

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,760
of the drones

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
that they can easily integrate this data

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,200
into their own i.t systems and own it

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,640
workflows

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,319
using the connectivity it also means

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,799
that you can operate your drones

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,360
from anywhere in the world over the

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,720
internet

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,120
just like we demonstrated two months ago

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,519
now what's next as we announced we're

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
going to start taking orders in august

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,519
but at the same time we're also going to

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,040
start our early access program

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,439
which means that the initial batch of

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,239
skynodes is already going to be ready to

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,959
be shipped

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,760
by that time and if you want to become

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,599
part

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,599
of that early access program head over

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,799
to our website using the link below

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,799
and register today for the program

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,560
that's it from my site thanks for tuning

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,680
in and enjoy the rest

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,680
