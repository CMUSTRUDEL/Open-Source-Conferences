Description: 
	Title: What's the difference between a drone and a flying robot?

Summary: When a ROS developer looks at a drone, it's a robot that can fly. When a PX4 developer looks at a ground robot it's a plane that can only taxi. Both are valid perspectives, but how do we reconcile the viewpoints? This talk will explore what's unique about drones and where there are tools that might be valuable to leverage from the general robotics community, as well as looking at what in the drone community could potentially be reused in the general robotics community. And finally, what are good ways that the communities can collaborate?

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2

all right we're back guys welcome back

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:07,710
to the kitchen for developers summit

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,690
welcome to the next session what's the

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:10,200
difference between a drone and a flying

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,210
robot

00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,940
batula food community and business

00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,460
development manager for open robotics

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,529
I'm really excited for this one I gotta

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,600
say that I'm a big fan of truly sorry

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:23,910
I'm a fan

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,570
he's been doing awesome work on the west

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,010
side and the Ross community I want to

00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,810
say something quickly about the Ross

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,309
community let me just go back to my life

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:38,280
that gun Hey hi joining here from Ross

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,870
community welcome we want you here we

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,790
want to interact with you please let us

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:43,920
know if there's anything we can do to

00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,289
make your life easier so Rawls developer

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,270
there's nothing better to us than having

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:51,600
other community lo community members

00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,030
join our community trying to set up our

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,239
stuff run our tutorials let us know if

00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,469
there's anything that's not sure that's

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,420
not clear

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:05,159
we're always some slack trying to help

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,260
you out we're really going doing a lot

00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,619
of effort to get make sure that broad

00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:13,530
compatibility is up to date and working

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,080
really good out of the box so having

00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,439
said that welcome everyone from Roscoe

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,299
vad

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:23,909
I'm gonna get the mic back to - Lee -

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,570
years till here thank you again for

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:28,790
sticking with us live stirring right

00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,920
thank you to Lee for sticking with us

00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:35,090
now go back to you Tom when I move my

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,159
mic now thank you thank you my pleasure

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:40,770
so as Ramon mentioned I'm telling fit

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,939
from open robotics my role is the

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,340
community and business development

00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,680
manager here I've been doing robotics

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,140
for my whole career but flying has a

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,390
special place in my heart all along my

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:53,610
grandfather was a pilot and loved

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,439
building model airplanes he flew a lot

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,450
of passive gliders and was an early

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,610
adopter of control back when his highly

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:01,409
advanced to have a single servo and it

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,170
was just pure analog control for my

00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:06,450
joystick in your hand I caught the bug

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,050
blaze my own path becoming a helicopter

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:16,080
pilot instead I've built a hovercraft

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:17,250
drones had a lot of fun so now I have

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,100
the title what's the difference between

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:22,020
a drone and flying robot I wanted to use

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:24,720
this to inspire thoughts and discussions

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,220
within the community and the thinking

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,480
about how to connect outside of this

00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,220
community and etc as Lorenz mentioned

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,930
Ross has been a component of the px4

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,400
ecosystem for a long time we've been

00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,330
collaborating on projects from the early

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,780
days back

00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,880
at ETH Zurich and there are a lot of

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,530
tools in Ross that you can leverage in

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,610
this community I'm gonna highlight some

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:46,860
of those but I also want to take this

00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,200
opportunity to challenge you the

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:51,390
community to think even bigger Ross is

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,490
but one large project out there with

00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:58,200
lots of resources but there are many

00:02:53,490 --> 00:03:00,270
more and a lot of this comes from our

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,460
mission at open robotics which is to

00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:04,860
facilitate open source robotics which

00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:07,380
includes drones and there's also a much

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,860
much larger community out there of

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:14,250
projects etc that we can all leverage

00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,380
I just background on over Ebonics

00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,180
themselves we have a team spread around

00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,620
the world working on all sorts of

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:26,820
projects cars drones etc lots of fun

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,620
stuff specifically we have two main

00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:31,080
projects that we work on here at open

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,030
robotics the Ross project the robot

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,530
operating system and ignition gazebo now

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:41,580
these are two large projects they have

00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:44,490
arch into many many types of robots have

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:46,650
a huge community around the world but

00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,380
we're happy to be pushing forward to

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:52,110
getting these into the next generation

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:53,730
many of our familiar with gazebo and

00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,460
RAAF's they've been going both of them

00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,710
are going for well over a decade and we

00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,210
are pushing into ignition gazebo which

00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:05,030
is the next generation of gazebo and

00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:07,200
Ross 2 is out and ready to go

00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:11,040
speaking of which we have just released

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,940
Ross to foxy Fitzroy this is our second

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,709
LTS release of Ross - and this is the

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:18,299
one where we really think that it's time

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,620
for people to pick up the torch and

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:24,620
start carrying Ross - as the primary

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,570
mantle - think about what you're doing

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:32,820
for Ross versus Ross - we're ready to

00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:35,040
say it's time to switch forward and Ross

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,470
- is being driven by open robotics but

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,050
we are actually now a small component of

00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:45,150
the ecosystem you can see here the logos

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:49,610
of our TSC oh wait I should be

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,610
presenting tonight sorry

00:04:51,050 --> 00:05:00,750
now you can see the logos of the TSC no

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,330
hmm these are lots of companies from all

00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:09,840
around the world using Ross - and many

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:13,190
different environments and we're happy

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,190
to have them all coming on board now

00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,780
so to give you a sense of scale of

00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,590
what's happening in the Ross community

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,960
we have well over 300 companies many of

00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,139
them big some of them small many small

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:31,550
as well I looked at the numbers for last

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:34,280
year and we had over 260 million binary

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,070
downloads of our Debian packages we have

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:39,290
35 thousand users on our Q&A forums

00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,680
5,000 users on our disk discourse

00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:45,470
instance we have over 2,000 repositories

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,870
indexed and we've got hundreds of

00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,389
thousands monthly visits on our websites

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:53,360
and if you're doing research

00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:58,370
there's also over 7,000 citations of our

00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:00,380
first paper from 2009 now it's a great

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,720
community encourage you all to get out

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:04,250
and explore it I'll give you some

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,900
highlights here but I'm really just

00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:11,740
gonna be able to gloss the surface in

00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:15,350
this quick presentation so now on to my

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:18,289
main topic if you take a look at this

00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:21,260
picture I'm gonna say how many of you

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,610
can see a duck facing the left and how

00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,760
many of you see a rabbit facing to the

00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,760
right

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:31,040
good news is in my survey of everyone

00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:37,220
that I saw raise their hands it's a tie

00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:42,440
and you can see it either way so really

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,880
this is a matter of perspective and some

00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,630
people see one way some people see it

00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,160
the other way

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,450
and depending on where you're coming

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:53,600
from what your perspective is you can

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,240
see it from either either way a lot of

00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,710
the px4 community is coming from my

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,780
controller side a lot of general

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,720
robotics is coming from a large

00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,670
microprocessor side and when you look at

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,380
the problems they have the same problem

00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:10,880
but you attack them in different ways

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:13,390
etc and the goal of this talk is to have

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,010
you become aware of your perspective and

00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,750
your perspective is not wrong but

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:22,760
sometimes it's valuable to be able to

00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:25,010
think about what the other side is so if

00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,810
you can't be aware of how the other side

00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,120
sees things and approaches things you're

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,850
basically going through your project and

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,370
might be basically thinking about with

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,610
blinders on and there's other valuable

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,080
approaches so when you're thinking about

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,620
these projects and when you're

00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,670
approaching something you want to be

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,300
able to think about what are your unique

00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,890
constraints what are you sharing what

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,570
can you share and what can you leverage

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,700
from the rest of the community

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:55,970
there's the Ross community leverage

00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:59,120
there's greater open source computer

00:07:55,970 --> 00:08:00,830
systems and other projects that have

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:06,170
lots of great things to take advantage

00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:08,120
of and this talk I'm going to be focused

00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,540
on practical open source there's a lot

00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,460
of talks about philosophy of open source

00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,950
and I'd love to talk more about that but

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,570
with limited time I think that because

00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,180
this is an open source community already

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:25,870
I'm going to skip that and leave that as

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:29,300
an exercise to the reader already so

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:32,240
there are many ethos global open source

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,070
communities with broths we've really

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,300
worked on making sure that we can have

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:39,620
federation simple small Composer

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,339
utilities following the

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:45,350
community Linux model and we don't want

00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:50,390
to reinvent the wheel there's a lot of

00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:52,100
content that we are out there and if we

00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,460
can leverage pre-existing things we

00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,500
don't have to rewrite it so we're

00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,570
looking for ways to produce really

00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,890
improve our efficiency and reduce our

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:06,110
effort to be able to get the same

00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:08,089
results if two of us work together we

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,410
can do twice as much work if there's a

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:11,150
hundred of us we can get a hundred times

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,160
farther and there may be some overlap

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,380
and inefficiencies and how much we can

00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,990
share so we may not get a hundred times

00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:21,140
more work but if we can only get 50%

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:25,370
overlap or improvement that means that

00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:29,990
we are will still be 50 times more

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:31,820
efficient so if everyone share is a

00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:34,660
little bit the network gets bigger and

00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:34,660
everyone benefits

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,540
specifically I want to call out reuse

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,360
and this is when you can take advantage

00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,920
of what other people have done and on

00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,839
the other side of their sharing which is

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,000
the flip side because if you can take

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,519
advantage of the work I done I've done I

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
need to share it back to you and

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,050
obviously these are great things to do

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,670
they're not all perfectly positive we

00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:58,259
want there are costs that you need to be

00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,730
able to verify the stuff that you're

00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,410
going to reuse if I share something with

00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,629
you and it's not up for the quality

00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:05,850
expanders that you want it can be a lot

00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:07,319
of work for you to test and improve it

00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:09,060
to make sure it meets your standards and

00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:11,370
so we want to be clear about our

00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,910
communication and make sure we're

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:18,870
sharing those things in ways that can be

00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,029
leveraged effectively and similarly

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:22,649
there's extra cost of sharing I want to

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,389
go through a little bit more polish to

00:10:22,649 --> 00:10:26,069
make sure to communicate to you that it

00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:29,370
works better works as well as you would

00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:31,699
expect it to work and it's not owned as

00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:33,750
true that you should share everything

00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:36,240
there are things that are unique to

00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,639
certain situations and if this thing is

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,889
useful only to me the effort to share it

00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,389
may not be right to do maybe I'll make

00:10:40,889 --> 00:10:47,629
sense because I'm going to spend effort

00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:50,009
of extra effort to share it and then no

00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:53,160
it's not useful to you because it's

00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:55,170
unique to me but the important thing is

00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,360
when you're looking at these things make

00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:59,579
sure to remember to avoid the not

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,990
invented here syndrome or you don't

00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,259
think about something because you didn't

00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:06,240
think about it so we're a little tight

00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:11,069
on time I'm going to speed things up and

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,750
blitz through the rest of this but there

00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:14,220
are a lot of things in the latest russ

00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,399
to release and I'm just gonna highlight

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:20,550
a handful of them here and remind you

00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:23,220
again don't think about the challenge

00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:24,870
have not invented here there are many

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,629
things out there they're done they're

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:32,370
done well find them and take advantage

00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:33,569
of them looking at Ross - one of the

00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,860
things that I think would be super

00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:37,170
valuable to drones is that they get

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,459
larger and become systems of systems we

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,559
gotta start thinking about more involved

00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:42,720
multiple process launching there are

00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,009
tools out there for that don't reinvent

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,939
those topic

00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:49,459
communication there are a lot of things

00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:50,689
out there standard messages that can be

00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:53,600
leveraged and are already used by a

00:11:50,689 --> 00:11:56,119
large community don't reinvent these

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,939
things and if you're interested I'm also

00:11:56,119 --> 00:12:01,220
still working on ref 147 a standards

00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:03,019
interface for aerial vehicles load to

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:06,439
get more or buying an input on that from

00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:07,699
this community and in addition when

00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:09,800
you're doing this communication there

00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:12,019
are lots of things like quality of

00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,939
service help you with urgency and

00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:16,639
reliability over limit bandwidth link as

00:12:13,939 --> 00:12:19,069
well as authentication encryption and

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,119
access control there are tools out there

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:25,790
don't reinvent them if you need or

00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:27,319
visualize 3d data arbitrary data you may

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,269
not know what's in your payload you want

00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:30,889
to be able to expandable and add new

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:34,519
data types or new sensors quickly

00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:36,800
they're tools for that bag files are

00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:38,449
really valuable they let you collect

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,809
arbitrary data keep it in a

00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:43,999
self-documenting way play them back it

00:12:41,809 --> 00:12:46,550
can be used for machine learning and

00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:48,410
training unit tests facilitating

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,829
collaboration with people that cannot

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:53,809
fly with you and also relatively easily

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:55,100
used for black box recordings where you

00:12:53,809 --> 00:13:00,769
can keep track of everything that goes

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:02,839
on there are lots of things as we start

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:04,759
to scale up to more vehicles more base

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,759
stations asynchronous and synchronous

00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:10,809
remote requests procedures there are

00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,809
lots of tools for that as well

00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,199
this is mentioned in front of earlier

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,319
talks we have tools for keeping track of

00:13:15,199 --> 00:13:19,429
transforms and environments one of the

00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:22,249
things I'd love to see a little bit more

00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:25,480
on Erised templates for their own

00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:28,339
descriptions so that we can simplify the

00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:32,269
launching process and coordination of

00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,620
standardized drone platforms there's a

00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:35,329
ton of moving and planning

00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,549
infrastructure out there and projects

00:13:35,329 --> 00:13:39,379
doing these things I'd love to see more

00:13:37,549 --> 00:13:41,089
integration with the px4 community in

00:13:39,379 --> 00:13:46,009
these areas and particularly I want to

00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:47,360
call out move it and slam and navigation

00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:47,990
there's a whole other research in this

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,939
area

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,009
drones are somewhat different and

00:13:49,939 --> 00:13:55,480
somewhat unique but don't discount

00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:55,480
everything else that's already happened

00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,730
of course simulation there's a lot of it

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,320
out there I have to say this is

00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:02,820
something that's already been moderately

00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,420
well integrated into the px core

00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:08,460
community I'd highlight this one of the

00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,740
things that I talked about last year I

00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,530
put out a call for input on what people

00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:15,690
would like to see in a drone playground

00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:18,240
and I'm happy to say that we have now

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:21,410
landed the results of that in the px4 s

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,540
main silla branch and if I press play

00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:30,270
you can see the results of this this is

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:32,270
our best realistic simulation of the bay

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,980
Leon's park here in Sunnyvale California

00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:38,000
the trees are as close to accurate as

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,800
possible you can run into them there are

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,900
playground swing sets these statues

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,330
everything is accurately texture mapped

00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:48,420
the trees are as close as possible to

00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:50,150
real-world if you are using ground

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:55,950
control you'll see the exact same thing

00:14:50,150 --> 00:15:00,060
from this realistic overhead data with

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:02,670
the ground so and lastly just to drop a

00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:03,570
mention of this there's my career off so

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:06,060
it's coming along

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,560
and I look in the my controller I'm not

00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,810
gonna say more about this but look

00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,820
forward to you know and hi Mays

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:13,820
presentation coming up later in this

00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:21,990
later in this conference so one final

00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,670
thought for me on things in the Ross

00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,350
community that might be valuable to be

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,180
able to be leveraged is that there's a

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:28,860
lot of tools to packaging this is

00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:30,630
something that the Ross community spent

00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:32,270
a lot of time on as well as the Greater

00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,560
Linux and open source communities

00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,480
there's a lot of tools out there and I

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:44,060
think that considering leveraging these

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:49,350
things would be great to facilitate more

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:51,180
collaboration with the community so to

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,910
finish this up I'd like to put a

00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,170
challenge back to you I've listed a lot

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,420
of things in the Ross community that I

00:15:55,170 --> 00:16:00,090
think would be valuable for you and I'd

00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,950
like you as the px4 community to think

00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:03,900
about what are some of the things in

00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,750
your community that might be valuable to

00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,740
the Greater robotics community that you

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,660
could share

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,710
and increase the number of people with

00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,360
which your facilitate collaborating as I

00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:19,100
talked about we want to get to bigger

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,710
bigger communities bigger systems and so

00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:24,990
if we can have this collaboration go

00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:27,150
both ways that would be great

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,970
just off the top of my head there are

00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,640
great top-down mapping interfaces in the

00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,410
drone community as well as free space

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,240
planners and potential situational

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,190
awareness tools and sleep management

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,820
things that might be valuable for say

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:43,950
boats or cars so think about what you're

00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,240
working on has someone else done

00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:49,200
something similar can you take advantage

00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:50,340
of what they're doing and if you're

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,810
doing something you think someone else

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,600
might be doing simpler can you share

00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:58,790
what you're doing to let them take

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:01,050
advantage of it and as a last reminder

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:03,150
don't fall onto the non-event and care

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:07,200
trap it can be something it'll decrease

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:09,330
productivity overall and it can be

00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,750
counterproductive to for progress we can

00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:18,150
all do more if we work together so thank

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:24,980
you everyone and a couple of questions I

00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:28,080
see coming in so the bales gazebo world

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,990
is asked where you can get it it's

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:34,590
available in the defaults it'll launches

00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:37,740
now I believe we also are hosting it in

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:40,170
the gazebo of fuel repositories so if

00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,850
you go the standard gazebo tools I

00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,620
should be able to download it from there

00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:45,960
as well so standard built-in library

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,010
with all the models are available in our

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,010
online repository

00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,240
so then another question is compared to

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:59,380
Ross Wan how lightweight can Ross to be

00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,000
I don't have a good metric answer to be

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,250
able to give you this but we are really

00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,470
targeting to be able to run down on two

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,090
microcontrollers there's more

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,000
information from you know and I'm a

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,760
that'll be coming up in a later talk but

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,450
we are we can get down to a much much

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:15,450
lighter interface

00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:23,109
and third question what is the fun and

00:18:21,489 --> 00:18:29,820
we'll need for Ross and why not just

00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:33,090
integrate Ross capabilities into px4 so

00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:37,330
what does the fundamental need for Ross

00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:40,599
the underlying thing that Ross is doing

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:42,729
is mostly facilitating collaboration by

00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,979
providing standard interfaces for people

00:18:42,729 --> 00:18:47,080
to talk between as well as providing

00:18:44,979 --> 00:18:50,349
standard modules that people can

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:53,349
interact plug and play and rip swap out

00:18:50,349 --> 00:18:54,549
and do the collaboration so if I write a

00:18:53,349 --> 00:18:56,049
slant module and you write a slant

00:18:54,549 --> 00:19:02,289
module we're using the same interface

00:18:56,049 --> 00:19:03,940
and the same different implementation we

00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:06,879
can plug our different implementations

00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:09,009
into the system moderately easily using

00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:12,430
Ross packages and Ross launch files and

00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:14,050
the standard Ross interface

00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,260
why not just integrate Ross capabilities

00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:18,580
into px4 that's a great idea I think

00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:20,620
that we are making good progress on

00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,300
getting going in that direction being

00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,010
able to make the bridge between Ross and

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,590
px4 much much smaller

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,730
and again I'll refer you to I'm a new

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:32,880
nose talk coming up in a little bit so

00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,880
