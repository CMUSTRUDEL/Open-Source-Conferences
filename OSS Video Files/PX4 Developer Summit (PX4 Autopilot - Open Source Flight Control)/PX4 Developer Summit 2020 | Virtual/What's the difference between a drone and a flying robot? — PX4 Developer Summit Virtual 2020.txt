	Title: What's the difference between a drone and a flying robot?

Summary: When a ROS developer looks at a drone, it's a robot that can fly. When a PX4 developer looks at a ground robot it's a plane that can only taxi. Both are valid perspectives, but how do we reconcile the viewpoints? This talk will explore what's unique about drones and where there are tools that might be valuable to leverage from the general robotics community, as well as looking at what in the drone community could potentially be reused in the general robotics community. And finally, what are good ways that the communities can collaborate?

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2
