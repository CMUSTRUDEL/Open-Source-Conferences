	Title: PX4 and FAA Type Certification

Summary: PX4-based vehicles are in the first group of applicants that the FAA is reviewing for the new streamlined performance-based Type Certification, which will make it much easier for them to be granted permission to fly beyond Part 107 restrictions after October when most of the current waivers expire.

I lead one team going through this with the FAA and also lead the ASTM process to create a standard for the testing to get such a certification. PX4 data is becoming the template for such testing, and I'll talk about several of the more challenging aspects of that that we're working through, including the inclusion of simulation data in lieu of some flight data and allowance for third-party apps built on MAVSDK

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
