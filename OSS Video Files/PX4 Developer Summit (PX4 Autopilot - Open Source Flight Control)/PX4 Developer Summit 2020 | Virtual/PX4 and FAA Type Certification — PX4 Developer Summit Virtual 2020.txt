Title: PX4 and FAA Type Certification â€” PX4 Developer Summit Virtual 2020
Publication date: 2020-07-19
Playlist: PX4 Developer Summit 2020 | Virtual
Description: 
	Title: PX4 and FAA Type Certification

Summary: PX4-based vehicles are in the first group of applicants that the FAA is reviewing for the new streamlined performance-based Type Certification, which will make it much easier for them to be granted permission to fly beyond Part 107 restrictions after October when most of the current waivers expire.

I lead one team going through this with the FAA and also lead the ASTM process to create a standard for the testing to get such a certification. PX4 data is becoming the template for such testing, and I'll talk about several of the more challenging aspects of that that we're working through, including the inclusion of simulation data in lieu of some flight data and allowance for third-party apps built on MAVSDK

The PX4 Developer Summit is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd

community welcome back to the px4

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,400
developers summit day two I have Chris

00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,469
Anderson on the line he's going to be

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,420
speaking about px4 NFA I type

00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:14,610
certification Chris Anderson is the CEO

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,029
of 3d robotics and a member of the AFA

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:20,189
strong Advisory Committee leads the ASTM

00:00:18,029 --> 00:00:22,650
behind the ASTM type certification

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,119
workgroup GTR is one of the first

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,090
companies to go all the way through with

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,500
the FAA new durability and reliability

00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:30,960
time certification process for low-risk

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,850
drunks and works closely with Microsoft

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,790
Erickson team laying the groundwork for

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:38,190
simulated ps4 data to be accepted in

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,070
lieu of our real work beta for some of

00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,540
the required Dion our demonstrations

00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:46,110
Chris is one of the founding members for

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,969
drone good overall pillar of the

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,960
community and I'm really excited to come

00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,030
into their summit

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,059
please community let's welcome Chris

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:59,820
Anderson thanks Ramon I assume we are

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,480
actually live showing up on the stream

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,309
okay very very good

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,780
hi everybody this has been really

00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:09,210
impressive I'm so proud to see this

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,549
community growing eyes Ramon said I've

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,970
been here from the beginning you know

00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:18,270
really the beginning like 2007 beginning

00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:20,040
these days I most of what I do is on the

00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:24,950
regulatory side one of the one of the

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,360
curses of being successful in you know

00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,159
building up a bottoms-up you know an

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,439
organization and then bottoms up

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,790
community and helping you know create

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,130
what we have here today is that a

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,720
certain point you go from the you know

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,090
hey we're just kind of you know working

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,040
in the gray zone we're kind of under the

00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,930
radar or just you know you know

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,490
researchers and Ti wires in a certain

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,140
point you win and you're just like okay

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,220
this is real we're really out there

00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,560
we're doing we're doing you know

00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,630
important work and then you have to you

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,850
know comply with the regulatory process

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,200
in this case the regulatory process was

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:56,880
really not designed for what we do and

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,560
so we had to help create the regulatory

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,759
process and somewhat I'm gonna be

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,740
talking to you today is about it's about

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,450
you know where we stand on that and

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,030
exciting new developments so let me just

00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:13,260
switch now to my presentation I hope you

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,760
can see that so you

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:17,610
I'm gonna be talking to you he's sort of

00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,810
with someone two of my hats on the FAA

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:23,099
you know Advisory hats and the ASTM hat

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,049
which is the standards body which we'll

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:26,010
talk about in a second a lot of the

00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:28,099
things we're talking about had been

00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,299
echoed in some of the previous talks

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:33,299
they've been going on to all cite those

00:02:30,299 --> 00:02:37,500
where we're relevant but basically the

00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:40,650
the big news here is that the big news

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,810
here is this notion of type

00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,730
certification and you may ask you know

00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,290
why do I need type certification what

00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,209
what's this all about you know we're

00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,019
flying fine right now but the reality is

00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,959
that we are not flying fine as the iris

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:56,819
presentation set pointed out yesterday

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,099
we're supposed to be flying autonomously

00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,780
beyond visual myocyte doing all those

00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:03,090
things that drones could do and yet and

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,980
yet you know today almost all operations

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:08,280
are limited to Yanam you know to within

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,700
visual line of sight um you know under

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,349
400 feet you know one pilot one vehicle

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,480
basically the drone industry has not yet

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:17,430
begun the drones terms are supposed to

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,379
be autonomous vehicles flying you know

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,959
anywhere anytime under their own steam

00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,329
and we're still at a one-man one one

00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,669
person one one two one drone world and

00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,230
the reason being is regulation

00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,510
technically as you've seen over the last

00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:33,209
two days we technically these drones can

00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,560
fly autonomously anywhere but you know

00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:36,030
we're not allowed to in the United

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,319
States and by the way I this

00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:39,000
presentation is gonna be focused on the

00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:41,370
United States and FAA I'll touch a

00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,940
little bit on on your parallels

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,500
elsewhere so what's stopping it and you

00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,109
know if you look at this slide that the

00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,840
iris showed yesterday the stats you know

00:03:49,109 --> 00:03:53,430
we have you know yes the beyond

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,590
visualize sites you know waivers have

00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,870
been issued yes there's more of them but

00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,040
it's just housing so should be hundreds

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,930
of thousands there should be millions

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,639
you shouldn't need waivers at all it

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,019
should just be a normal thing and so

00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,940
we're really really waiting for

00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:09,060
something and that something is a

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,549
foundation of safety which is called

00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:15,180
pipe certification or air worthiness of

00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:16,440
the vehicles right now the FAA all the

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,570
things you've been hearing about whether

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,970
it's drone delivery or you know the IP

00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,099
ease or you know any particular

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:25,389
operations bound part 107 have all been

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:28,469
all required a special waiver

00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:31,419
and the FAA is just overwhelmed by these

00:04:28,469 --> 00:04:32,020
now you know that's because they're all

00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,419
different

00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,159
it's kind of an ad hoc one-off sort of

00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,599
regulatory process and what they need is

00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:40,060
they need drones to start to look like

00:04:37,599 --> 00:04:42,009
the things that are used to to to

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,900
certifying or used to used to regulating

00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:46,029
and that means type certification but

00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:47,800
you know type certification is the kind

00:04:46,029 --> 00:04:49,960
of thing you heard about with a 737 max

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,779
it's extremely expensive it takes it

00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:54,039
takes a long time it's designed for

00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:56,620
vehicles that can be you know jet liners

00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:58,120
and you know the question is is there a

00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,520
reformer type certification that was

00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:04,210
appropriate for this new class of small

00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:06,789
unmanned vehicles and the answer is is

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,050
yes and not only is answer yes but I'll

00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:10,330
tell you I'll be talking to you about

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,840
that and the deadline is is actually

00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,610
this year so many of these exemptions

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,620
and waivers and especially the IPPS

00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,270
which are these pilot projects are

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,460
expiring in October just a few months

00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:23,529
and so we need a new form of

00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,029
certification to be able to allow these

00:05:23,529 --> 00:05:27,550
kind of operations to not only continue

00:05:25,029 --> 00:05:30,669
but expand under this under process it

00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:33,250
doesn't overwhelm the FAA and so and so

00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,289
the answer is a new form of type

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,839
certification I want to call out two

00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:39,189
more quotes and iris presentation was I

00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:42,189
thought really made made a good point

00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:43,839
which is that you know although it is a

00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,430
pain to have to go through the

00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,649
certification process and we've been

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,279
lucky to date that you know the early

00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:52,960
days of the of the of the drone industry

00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:55,330
because of things like part 107 because

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,180
of exemptions like you know you know

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,520
developer exemptions or or recreational

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,740
use exemptions we've we've been spared

00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,569
all this and does seem like it's like uh

00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,490
you know I thought this is we're trying

00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:08,469
to avoid but in fact it's actually a

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:12,279
good thing to to get certified because

00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:13,960
it's gonna allow us to to accelerate you

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,479
know from here it's a little bit of pain

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,680
right now for a lot of gain later and

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,849
it's got a lot of this autonomous era of

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,939
the drone industry that we've wanted all

00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:26,740
along um the new form certification is

00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:28,750
called durability and reliability and

00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,250
it's basically streamlined it is

00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,529
supposed to be you know compared to

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,940
traditional type certification but get

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:37,449
into in a second this is supposed to be

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,650
fast and cheap and it has allows you to

00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:40,570
continue innovating and

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,520
more importantly it reflects this new

00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:44,680
class of FAA regulation called

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,229
performance-based so the traditional

00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,030
form of certification they actually

00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:51,090
certified the individual components so

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:53,289
engines have to have you know

00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,789
maintenance standards and mean time

00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,350
between failures and just gets down into

00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:58,750
every little element including the

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:01,990
software and so you know one of the

00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,580
reasons the 737 max was such a crisis is

00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,190
that the software really had not been

00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:07,690
the software's dating back in 30 years

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:09,669
and that it's because it was so

00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,930
expensive to recertify the software

00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:13,090
anytime they want to make a change as a

00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,860
patch on top of the old software and so

00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,600
a certain point after 30 years of this

00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,490
stuff the patches are are you know

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,229
outweighed the core code it becomes a

00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:21,970
maintenance nightmare and that's really

00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:23,979
where they were they they were and so

00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,949
the notion is what if we treat the

00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:28,360
vehicle as kind of a black box and you

00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:29,949
say look you know we don't we don't

00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,870
really need to know we the FAA don't

00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,460
really use know what's inside it's we

00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,889
don't need to know what the individual

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,139
you know reliability of the components

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:39,610
are if the entire system proves that it

00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:41,710
does what you say it's going to do and

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:43,479
it's durable and reliable and that's

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:45,099
good enough and then you can do minor

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,139
changes you know within the vehicle

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:48,610
itself including software updates as

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:51,639
long as it doesn't change these overall

00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:53,110
performance parameters and that's that's

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,690
exactly what we want I think that

00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:57,729
reflects was appropriate for this class

00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,440
of low-risk vehicles in this pace of

00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:01,960
innovation you know we don't want to

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,789
have to lock down px4 on a vehicle and

00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,229
not be able to update it for the life of

00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:07,720
that vehicle without having to go

00:08:05,229 --> 00:08:09,280
through certification and and so you

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,260
know the ability to do these kind of

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,760
minor incremental maintenance and

00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,970
improvement changes is really going to

00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:18,639
help us innovate so so who can who can

00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,260
apply for a type certification this is

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,690
again in a u.s. effort so you have to be

00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:25,840
US company you have to be if that was

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,760
called design authority so whether you

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,199
design and make it yourself or just

00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:32,110
design it and have someone else make it

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,510
or even work somebody else who's like an

00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,440
OEM who's you know who has components

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,969
that you can use

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
you have to somebody needs to be

00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,810
responsible for the design that's Paul

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,430
does not having design Authority and by

00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,250
the way a part of this I know is because

00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,870
3d ours is going through this process as

00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,370
well and we're one of the first end will

00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:49,930
probably be one of the first out that

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,290
this this year so we've been through the

00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:53,570
entire process

00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,550
and so we really no know it well and so

00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:57,290
we I think the questions I can talk a

00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,269
little bit about design Authority

00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,100
entails I can't add a US production

00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:02,300
facility and the reason is because

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,009
they're gonna do with per touch to a

00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,480
production inspection they're gonna you

00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:07,220
need a production certificate on your

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,290
facility and then he's here as well and

00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,019
the vehicles need to be in this sort of

00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,639
low-risk category which you probably

00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:16,970
think of as fifty five pounds but is now

00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:19,699
expressed in in Newtons and you know an

00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:21,410
energy some kinetic energy of the

00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:25,370
vehicles this combination of weight and

00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,380
speed um TC by itself will not let you

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:29,329
do all those those wonderful things but

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:31,759
it does make it much easier to get to

00:09:29,329 --> 00:09:33,620
those other places so once you happen to

00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,959
the TC your aircraft is considered air

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,509
worthy and that's and that's great then

00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:39,920
then once it's an air worthy then you

00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:41,660
have to work with an operator or if

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,699
you're like a like a Google wing or an

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:46,279
Amazon Prime and you are yourself an

00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:47,509
operator you just do you see you just go

00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:49,190
to the FAA and say well this is what

00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:51,350
this is this is how we're going to

00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,819
operate is all our CONOPS or concepts of

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:54,440
operations here's the safety protocols

00:09:52,819 --> 00:09:56,660
we're gonna deal here's where we're

00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,589
gonna fly and what times and things like

00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,660
that now it doesn't have to be

00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:01,250
specifically one geography that's the

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,190
difference between this new form and the

00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,480
old and the old exemptions and waivers

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:07,399
but has to be certain class of air

00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,589
spaces from the class of geography so if

00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,779
you say we're gonna fly over unpopulated

00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:13,279
areas that's great if you say well we're

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:14,839
gonna fly over populated areas of a

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,279
certain population Tennessee will

00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,319
there's a way to address that as well

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,850
but once you get that once you get that

00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:21,560
that permission to fly under those

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:24,730
CONOPS you can basically take anywhere

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,550
at any time where those environmental

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:30,500
parameters are hold and then and then

00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:33,649
you know once you have that you then you

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,540
know you have permission to to fly under

00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,399
under that type certification there's

00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,839
certain requirements about tracking your

00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,470
flights if there's a crash and these be

00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,880
reported and if you want to extend your

00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,380
operations you just go back and you and

00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,730
you say we'd like to extend our CONOPS

00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:48,500
to maybe a higher population density

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:52,009
there may be some additional tests you

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:54,050
do that um the way this contrast to the

00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:56,300
traditional type of certification that

00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:58,430
you know Boeing or Lockheed Martin would

00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,850
do is that you know as opposed to like a

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,439
decade or longer it's supposed to take

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,840
three six months now this first one has

00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:07,390
been has been before

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,610
for a couple years now but but you know

00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,490
this is once we get this dialed in it's

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:14,980
gonna be three to six months as opposed

00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:17,320
to millions of dollars to go through the

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,850
testing process this should cost could

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,590
cost less than a hundred thousand

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,600
dollars depending on on how much of the

00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:25,810
testing you've already done it's only

00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,330
for the the low the small and the

00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,280
low-risk you know unmanned vehicles so

00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,260
you know you're not gonna be able to be

00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,510
making air taxi this way but it's a

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,890
great way for the FAA to start getting

00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,120
some experience with this new

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,460
performance-based type certification

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,140
building up data so that they can extend

00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:45,400
it to higher risk categories going

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:47,890
forward on a data-driven perspective to

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,960
get this you've got to you know to do

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:50,830
the demonstrations not tests in the

00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,150
sense because you've already done your

00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,680
testing as part of our need this is

00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:55,630
demonstrating to the FAA that your

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,780
vehicle is durable and reliable there's

00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:00,550
two classes of these demonstrations the

00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:02,380
first one is just a lot of ours you

00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:04,720
basically take a representative

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,630
operation so maybe it you know it's a

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,240
you take off and flies autonomously you

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,770
know or some lawn mower pattern lands if

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,750
that's representative that spot and you

00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:16,390
just do tons of them you can see at

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,970
least 400 hours and it can go up to two

00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:22,330
thousands depending on your own on your

00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,710
CONOPS um and then that you do those

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,270
lots of times and then there's a bunch

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,100
of other demonstrations that you do just

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,590
a few times sometimes only once and this

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,410
basically demonstrates things like your

00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:33,820
you know your failure modes

00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:36,520
environmental range etc now there's

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:38,230
thirty two kinds of those and we're

00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,730
gonna be publishing all the FAA

00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,530
publishers will publish those as part of

00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:42,880
its so-called means of compliance so

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:47,620
we're going to be publishing as well

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:49,060
October as part of our ASTM regs but you

00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,220
know when you take these 32 different

00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,680
kinds of specific demonstrations about

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,120
you know different kinds of blight four

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,520
kinds of failures and then you combined

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,590
with all the variations of environment

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,900
and center of gravity and temperature

00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:03,790
and air pressure etc it gets kind of

00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,470
overwhelming and so we're gonna get into

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:07,420
a little bit of how to how to make that

00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:12,340
less overwhelming with possibly

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:15,250
simulation um the FA nominated me to to

00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:16,690
lead the ASTM counterparts to this and

00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,770
this is this is the way it always works

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:20,020
the FAA so

00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,250
the US regulators this is true for

00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,620
regulators around the world

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,780
they typically tried to use industry

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,640
standards whenever possible so in this

00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,590
case the FDA says this is what we want

00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,610
to see in terms of the means of

00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,980
compliance but they don't tell you how

00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,500
to achieve it then they turn to ASTM and

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,730
they ask ASTM the standards by to put

00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,250
together a working group and the working

00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,340
group then comes up with a very long

00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:45,610
basically you know a tutorial on how to

00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:47,500
deliver the data that the FAA needs and

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,780
that's that's the working group that I

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,100
lead we are in balancing right now so

00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,470
we've essentially finished most of our

00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:55,870
work this is just one example of what it

00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,700
looks like you can see that I just taken

00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,940
one of the 32 and this is about a

00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:02,980
geofencing and you know the first column

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:04,780
on the left is what the FAA says they

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,820
want they say if Jim fencing is used to

00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:09,040
maintain safe operations demonstrates

00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:11,320
the logic works and it contains the

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,450
vehicle now this then the second column

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,100
says okay here's how you actually do

00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:16,930
that here's the demonstration you do and

00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,910
then the over on the right there's just

00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,170
an extension that a first column and it

00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,670
introduces some of the things you should

00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:23,110
think about and so like this is a

00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:25,120
particular case where you have two

00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,340
things going on on one hand you've got a

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,200
you've got a failure so it should you

00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:30,760
know it under this particular failure

00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,310
the vehicle should be flying back home

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,220
on the other hand you've got geofences

00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:37,870
and you know one should not preempt the

00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:39,400
other so for example if you were to fly

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,810
straight back home you would actually be

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,240
breaching a geofence and there might be

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,920
you know a school there or building or

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,970
something like that so in this case you

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:47,800
need to make sure you need to

00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:50,260
demonstrate that your return to home

00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,190
also respects the geofence and so this

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:55,540
is this combinatorial logic that is you

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,780
need to demonstrate that oh so the FAA

00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:01,300
knows it's going to work now as I

00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:02,770
mentioned there is a overwhelming you

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,460
know if you look at all the permutations

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:09,030
of the tests you need to do and the

00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,320
environmental conditions you know etc

00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:13,150
and let me go back here just just one

00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,320
slide if you look here I mean this is a

00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,790
look at the slide on the right when you

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,090
look at all that variations just look

00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:22,540
that one this is one test which says you

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:25,780
know just fly a distribution of just fly

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,030
a mission but then it says okay what do

00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:30,070
you also need to do it with your center

00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:31,120
of gravity you know full forward full

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,470
form

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,790
full right yet meet your center of

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,499
gravity around so that means your

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:37,870
payload etcetera and then you also have

00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:40,809
to do it under you know if we your high

00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:42,819
and your low temperature high and low

00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:45,220
pressure you know humidity whatever else

00:15:42,819 --> 00:15:48,249
you specified if you look all the the

00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,800
edges and all the corners of this test

00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:53,110
matrix you can guess you can get tens of

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,850
thousands of tests which you normally

00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:56,649
would have to do not obviously that's

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,420
not that's not reasonable and sometimes

00:15:56,649 --> 00:15:59,949
you can say well look you know on this

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:01,180
particular vehicle maybe center gravity

00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:03,699
super important fix doing this

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,949
particular vehicle it's not as it's not

00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:08,589
as important so you just negotiate this

00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:11,889
with the FAA but another way to do it is

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:12,999
to bring in simulation this is a big

00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:15,459
part of what I'm doing right now and

00:16:12,999 --> 00:16:16,899
display it falls on very neatly from you

00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:18,370
know pollen quotas and air sim

00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:20,949
presentation so we're working very

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:24,009
closely with the industry as a whole but

00:16:20,949 --> 00:16:27,610
especially Microsoft on coming up with a

00:16:24,009 --> 00:16:29,290
way to construct simulation processes

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:34,779
that can be acceptable to the FAA for

00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:36,639
for certification so this is a diagram

00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:38,740
sort of shows you how it would work so

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,809
the the tests are kind of right down the

00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,429
center of your operations the kind of

00:16:40,809 --> 00:16:44,889
things you actually powder all the time

00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:46,269
you should definitely do that in the

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,089
real world and you should probably do it

00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:51,339
enough times that you you can prove your

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,379
durable reliable so that's where the

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:54,730
four hundred hours come from then you

00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,499
start to move to something things you

00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:58,379
encounter more rarely these would be

00:16:56,499 --> 00:17:01,649
maybe temperature or pressure you know

00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:04,209
situations altitude situations you know

00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:06,010
battery you know the battery situations

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:08,529
power situations that are kind of very

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:11,260
unusual and you know if it's it's really

00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:13,089
if it's really risky and you probably

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,649
are going to encounter at some point in

00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:17,020
your in your operations and you should

00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:19,539
probably do is couple tests to show that

00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:21,579
that works but then there's a bunch of

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:23,350
others where you're probably never gonna

00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,470
encounter it or it's very rare or you

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,179
don't think it's high-risk or or it's

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,020
just that you just want to come you just

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:34,120
want to touch all the edges of the

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,470
simulated environment but you know

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,669
you've already done the same sort of

00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,169
environmental testing and a bunch of

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,390
other tests and feels a little redundant

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:42,570
and there's a case for just doing that

00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:44,010
in simulation an automated simulation

00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:46,290
you know

00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:49,380
essentially filling out your sparse

00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:51,120
matrix and turning into a against matrix

00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,890
where you really can hit all the test

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,200
points some of them simulated some of

00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:57,240
them real and are just appear with us

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,700
with our simulation project is to figure

00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:01,910
out you know how to choose which tests

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,960
to do in simulation how to run those

00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,670
simulations so that they're persuasive

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,140
and then how to statistically

00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,820
demonstrate that this is high fidelity

00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,960
now there's predictable or there has

00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:14,730
predictive power to the FAA um so this

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,920
is this is really exciting now there are

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:19,050
other there are other non real-world

00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:20,670
flight options that will also be in

00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:22,440
scare consider there's going to be wind

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,850
tunnel you know that's one way to do it

00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,620
there's benchtop testing there's

00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,350
environmental chamber testing all of

00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,470
those you can be and it has historically

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,330
have been introduced as a kind of an

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,890
alternative means of compliance however

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:36,330
I think that you've given the volume of

00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,400
testing we're doing and giving how well

00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:41,310
this community is as a line around

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,960
simulation computer simulation is seems

00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,800
to be the one that's new and we should

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:48,570
emphasize the the most so let's give the

00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,660
story gives you the obvious pros and

00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,870
cons that the concert that DFA has

00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,780
really has very little precedent of

00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:00,570
accepting simulation in lieu of

00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:02,840
real-world testing in addition the FAA

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,490
is is pretty comfortable with

00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,170
deterministic you know the simulation

00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,660
you know they don't necessarily you know

00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,130
you know love simulation instead of

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,710
real-world testing but they get it it's

00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:15,300
like you know if you're doing a binary

00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,130
logic worked or it didn't work but once

00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,410
you give us a problem listed you know

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:21,540
simulations it's you know we need to

00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,000
help them help us with a statistical

00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,940
model they can they can understand and

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,110
so what we've done is we've basically

00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:31,080
divided the world of simulation into two

00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,030
groups there's the you know system logic

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,830
and that's kind of binary it works or it

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:36,690
doesn't work and you saw that I'm gonna

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,210
cite two a little long later on the talk

00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:41,040
Julia knows presentation was excellence

00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:42,750
and so what he showed you with the

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,180
hardware in the loop and software in the

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,860
loop was largely system logic you know

00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:49,470
and he gave you a perfect example of

00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,810
some kind of combination of GPS loss and

00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,860
and you know and and and battery life

00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,620
and things like that you just want to

00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,840
make sure that the the failure cascades

00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,000
you know just kind of all percolate

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:03,630
through them you know through the matrix

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,970
of combinations of actions correctly as

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,799
expected so that's that's pretty easy to

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,090
do and suffer in the loop and hardware

00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:11,309
in the loop and and again it could

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:14,460
produce this kind of pass/fail results

00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:17,190
um the other ones are all probabilistic

00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,020
and this is like you know this has to do

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,230
with simulating environment simulating

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,789
sensors simulating the wind and things

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,890
like that and and there you're going to

00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,080
get it will never be perfect yes because

00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:29,669
we can't simulate the real world with

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,539
infinite fidelity and so it's going to

00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:35,870
be some some approximation of the real

00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:38,640
world the question is is it good enough

00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:40,230
so you know so this is this is the way

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,390
you we're gonna we're going to propose

00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,190
this that you're gonna end up with this

00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,779
here's the matrix of all the various

00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,700
combinations this goes back to kind of

00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:49,770
Julian's work on me on the system logic

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,510
here's that here's all the combinations

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,559
that you might see I just kind of put

00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:54,990
numbers up there but you can imagine

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,820
what they are and here's some of them it

00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:59,100
was easy to test in the real world we do

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:00,510
have what we call fail boxes that we put

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,029
on top of the throw and it's really just

00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:05,370
a box with a with a separate radio

00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:09,000
connection and that box will like cut

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:11,070
out a GPS or it'll cut out a motor and

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,679
all you know or it'll disabled you know

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:14,850
the RC and those ones we can test in the

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,279
real world there's a bunch of others

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,110
that are that that we can't test in the

00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:21,149
real world or it's not practical to test

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,700
my real world and those will do in

00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,409
hundred the looper software in the loop

00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,850
this is the slide from from Julian's

00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,500
presentation I really would this is one

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,789
of the pre-recorded ones and I really

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,730
would encourage you to go back and look

00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:35,039
at it was fantastic but this is the two

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,860
- a screenshots from this that on the

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,320
top right you can see his hardware in

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,760
the loop in a box and that's and that's

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,039
great you can see it's besome motors

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,510
it's got some servos and you know in

00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:47,820
that way we can sort of test you know

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,620
some some basic logics and then I mean

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:51,480
you can automate those tests especially

00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:54,000
and both in hardware in the loop

00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,039
Manso the loop and he talked a lot about

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,220
how you could do that so that's that's a

00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:03,120
way to really do a logic testing at

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:04,950
scale and to help populate the matrix so

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,899
I'll leave that to his talk and

00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:09,240
encourage you to do that but there's a

00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:10,520
lot more simulations that need to be

00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,990
done so those are just

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,210
terminus ik ones on the probabilistic

00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,610
ones there's six more simulations that

00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,260
need to be done - you know it's -

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,960
essentially you know fully simulate a

00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,330
vehicle um there's the stuff that's kind

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,640
of you know basic aircraft operations

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,600
this is what's gonna be required by the

00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,429
DNR

00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,559
there's the Eva the physics and dynamics

00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:31,670
and then the environment you have to

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,740
simulate you can't just simulate the

00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:35,929
vehicle you have to simulate the error

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,090
and the wind and the antenna the

00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:39,710
temperature so you have to simulations

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:43,460
their aircraft physics and then

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:45,470
environmental ethics the GE presentation

00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,840
earlier yesterday it was also really

00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:49,100
good on this man Kurt if you haven't

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,860
seen that go back and see that they

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,530
really focus on on this sort of the best

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,510
practice in physics and dynamics how

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,120
they found you know the right ones for

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:01,280
them you know the pros and cons of the

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,690
various options and so I hope to work

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,550
further with them on that I was really

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:06,559
impressed by that then we need to

00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,210
simulate the environment in the problem

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,160
with the many the simulators we use

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:11,990
today like you know unity or on Unreal

00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,460
assessor's that they're really good at

00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:15,050
simulating kind of you know videogame

00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,900
environments but what we - we could

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,809
simulate something is appropriate to FAA

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:23,179
and a lot of this has to do with gusts

00:23:19,809 --> 00:23:24,260
and turbulence and around structures

00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,140
like in buildings in an urban

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:31,520
environment and instead it's a very

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:34,520
unusual sort of you know this is you

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,530
know fluid dynamic simulation I'll talk

00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,480
to you a little bit later about about

00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,100
you know the test environment work we're

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,540
doing some of that right now but those

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,030
are kind of you know those that's we're

00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,190
focusing and you know just give you one

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,830
example how difficult is sometimes to

00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:50,540
assess the fidelity of a simulator let's

00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:52,940
just say that we simulate wind gusts

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,320
pretty well we think well how do we how

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,510
do we compare that to the real world

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,179
well how do we measure wind gusts across

00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,920
an entire area you know there's all the

00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:02,750
wind vectors and all the altitudes and

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,580
geographies in that entire era well so

00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,960
the weather map won't tell you that will

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,460
just tell you the overall weather you

00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,720
can put up one weather station or two

00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,400
other stations that I'll tell you what

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,929
the weather's like there you can fly the

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
drone around to know what the weather is

00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,100
like around the throne itself but how do

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,990
you do the entire wind vector field for

00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:19,940
the entire area at a resolution that

00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:21,830
sort grown sized that's really in an

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,760
unsolved problem there's some efforts in

00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:26,090
doing that with Doppler

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:28,160
radar you can certainly do the you know

00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:29,600
try to measure wind gusts on the vehicle

00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,210
itself and then kind of project that

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,380
into a vector field but it's it's an

00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:36,950
interesting problem we're going to be

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,799
resolving that later uh you saw the Eris

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:41,630
M is highly focused on precession and

00:24:39,799 --> 00:24:44,570
there it's not just cameras but it's

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:46,460
lidar depth sensors radar sonar things

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,040
like that we have to simulate all those

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,299
all those sensors and then you have to

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,830
you know when you're let's say you're

00:24:50,299 --> 00:24:53,090
you're looking at a surface and you want

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,730
to see you you know how you know can I

00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:58,130
see that well you know which sensor can

00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:00,470
you see it in with your cameras that was

00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,480
it nighttime can you see what lidar you

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,220
know possibly is it large enough to hit

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,870
your resolution what about radar well

00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,700
what about the absorption of the surface

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:09,169
to radar you know is it doesn't this

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,000
advanced radar does it not and so we

00:25:09,169 --> 00:25:13,910
have to now model the material

00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,970
properties of the environment to get

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,049
that right and then we get into a you

00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:20,929
know the stuff that was covered in the

00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:23,080
iris talk about you know detect and

00:25:20,929 --> 00:25:25,340
avoid and you know traffic management

00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,100
there there's a there's quite a lot of

00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:30,740
good work especially done by NASA and

00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:33,140
the FAA in the past but detect an avoid

00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,520
in particular is a little difficult that

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,410
we don't have a lot of real-world data

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,700
of collisions thank God because this

00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:39,710
would be bad and we don't want it we

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,120
don't want to go up and fly up airplanes

00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:42,679
at each other all the time because that

00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:44,480
would also be dangerous and so now we

00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:46,990
need to kind of persuade the proceeding

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,419
excuse me procedurally generate

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,500
realistic collision scenarios approach

00:25:50,419 --> 00:25:54,200
scenarios

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,780
you know combinations of vehicles and

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,980
that you know that not only you you you

00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,690
are likely to see but also the ones

00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,220
you're unlikely see but not but not

00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,870
impossible and so that's gonna be a

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,580
probably to use things like you know

00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,929
jitter to that material networks and

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,840
there's been a lot of work on stuff for

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:11,299
having cars - you know model pedestrian

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,549
car you know Road combinations including

00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:14,750
really unusual ones and so we're

00:26:13,549 --> 00:26:18,980
probably going to build on some of that

00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:20,210
work in in in that domain um then we get

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,070
to the question of how do we how do we

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:23,870
prove with the fidelity and we're

00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:25,730
actually doing a lot of work on this

00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:28,010
right now there's something called a

00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:29,720
comet eel coefficient which is basically

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,700
actually comes out of a Shannon

00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,980
information theory it's an information

00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,440
entropy but it's basically you take two

00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,230
data sets and just

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,230
figures out how correlated they are and

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:42,880
so we've created a little bit of a of a

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,720
tool here that you can see on the left

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,420
we upload two to two data logs one real

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,890
one sim you can then you know let's say

00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,480
that their coordinate systems reversed

00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:53,980
you can you know to quickly align their

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,330
coordinate systems you can sort of move

00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:58,120
them around to the line of timestamps

00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:00,430
and then you can drag over the area you

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:03,670
want to see the correlation it'll

00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:05,680
generate a coefficient and we're doing

00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:08,440
this with some of the team same teams

00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,990
that are working with with Microsoft

00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,940
Mayor Sims autonomy and the University

00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:14,290
of North Dakota and as you probably saw

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,260
in the earlier demonstration there

00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,610
they're using a wind turbine field to do

00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,530
their research that's that's actually

00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,210
really useful because wind is the number

00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:23,470
one thing that we need to simulate and

00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:25,570
so not only to the wind turbines that

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:26,530
they have turbines so they have you know

00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,690
they know what the wind is at the

00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:30,250
turbine level but also so well it so

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,340
it's a wind farm so there's a really

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,080
well characterized you know wind

00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,490
environments and structures and

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,890
turbulence around the structures

00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:41,020
etcetera so so what's that space but

00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:45,340
we're going to be you know delivering

00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:48,430
some initial takes on the fidelity of a

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,320
very sim against the real world and also

00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:51,820
you know Alice of px4 because that's

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,440
what it's based on and we're gonna find

00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:55,150
out it's not gonna be perfect no it's

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,430
not gonna be perfect the questions where

00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:00,610
does it matter how predictive is it and

00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:02,290
how do we make it better so I just want

00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:04,870
to finish with this with this last slide

00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:07,420
before I before I take some some

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:09,640
questions this is uh this is an ongoing

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,430
research project that we're doing with

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:13,660
an industry working group you can see

00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:15,820
the list of the people were working with

00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:18,640
right now obviously I'd love you know I

00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:20,620
tend to add you know the GE folks and

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,830
the iris books you know say nothing of

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,030
the you know Tyrian folks to this going

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:27,040
forward we're really just getting

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:29,440
started on this it's an ad hoc group

00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,760
it's not official yes but we do this

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,330
part of the drone advisory committee I

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:37,120
haven't asked to to to to interject it

00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:40,090
as a sa it's a possible policy topic for

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:41,260
the FAA and DNR in the future and so

00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,660
what we really want to do is we want to

00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:45,330
kind of all get together figure out what

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,220
what what makes sense

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,180
prove it you know it with a couple pilot

00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,460
projects

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:54,070
then deliver it suit the FA in the form

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,710
of white paper so they formally find a

00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:58,630
way to accept simulation data in lieu of

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,270
real-world data to help us do the DNR

00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:06,220
type certification more quickly more

00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:09,040
cheaply or more reliably so that more

00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,350
people can do it so that is the end of

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:15,250
my formal presentation I think that is

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:17,650
also the end of my window so Ramon what

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,780
do you think should I am take questions

00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:22,300
here or do you want me to just take more

00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:23,140
slack you can take a few questions here

00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:26,230
okay

00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:33,220
good let me go back here and the

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:36,970
question is popping up I will I think

00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:41,200
they're also probably on the on the

00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:43,030
YouTube channel right yeah they're

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,130
injective channel 2 okay don't worry

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:46,930
let's do this why don't we send the

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:48,610
questions under public gigs for that

00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:53,110
summit channel and you can join us there

00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:54,400
yeah there are there are two there's one

00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,720
question I can take right now if you

00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,820
don't mind please okay this this

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,740
question was how did the updated FAA

00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,240
requirements affect waivers flights of

00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,660
experimental or the drums during the

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,340
initial R&D effort and the answer to

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,380
that is that many is are intended to

00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,330
expire in October and be replaced by

00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:15,370
type certification I think this will not

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:19,240
surprise you we're running a little late

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:21,250
on on this system it's it's it's a bunch

00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:23,260
of things but you know it's a new

00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,340
process for a it's quite radical and I

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,950
suspect there probably will be some

00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,730
extensions that it's not like everyone's

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,350
been being founded in October but what

00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:34,990
you are going to hear if you already

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:36,340
have a an FAA waiver or exemption you

00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,470
are going to hear from the FAA think

00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:40,660
I'll watch you to pretty much start

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:42,340
entering the the type certification

00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:44,320
process now they're not a lot of

00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:47,230
continue expanding the the waivers they

00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,300
don't have to so get on a type certified

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,180
platform there there will be several

00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,920
some of them are coming out of the px4

00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,970
community there's at least four that I

00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,720
know of they're going through the

00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:58,670
process right now including

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,770
three DRH 520 G which is our

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,920
collaboration with unique so there will

00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:04,910
be choices but in addition they'll you

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,710
know are the work we're doing right now

00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:09,710
is gonna make a lot easier for anybody

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:12,170
