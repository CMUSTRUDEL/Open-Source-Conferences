	Title: Is it a drone? Is it a plane? No, it's Jetman!

Summary: The Swiss pilot and inventor Yves Rossy has created the Jetman --a wearable wing powered by four jet engines-- with two simple goals: fly like a bird and have fun. After 25 years of development, the Jetman has demonstrated amazing feats, among which was the crossing of the English channel, a flight in the Grand Canyon, and formation flights with the French Acrobatic Patrol. However, to enable a truly autonomous human flight, the last remaining step was vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) from the ground.

In this session, I will show how the PX4 ecosystem enabled the world's first VTOL flight with a wearable wing capable of a maximum speed of 350 km/h and a maximum altitude of 5000 meters. The presentation will focus on both the technical and safety aspects of the project and will contain behind the scenes images of the test flights.
