Description: 
	Title: Is it a drone? Is it a plane? No, it's Jetman!

Summary: The Swiss pilot and inventor Yves Rossy has created the Jetman --a wearable wing powered by four jet engines-- with two simple goals: fly like a bird and have fun. After 25 years of development, the Jetman has demonstrated amazing feats, among which was the crossing of the English channel, a flight in the Grand Canyon, and formation flights with the French Acrobatic Patrol. However, to enable a truly autonomous human flight, the last remaining step was vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) from the ground.

In this session, I will show how the PX4 ecosystem enabled the world's first VTOL flight with a wearable wing capable of a maximum speed of 350 km/h and a maximum altitude of 5000 meters. The presentation will focus on both the technical and safety aspects of the project and will contain behind the scenes images of the test flights.

all right everyone uh we're back

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
your host remote here i'm happy to be

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,760
here uh

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,599
day two of the px4 developers summit um

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,400
next up we have an interesting session

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,960
we have uh

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
is it a drone is it a plane no it's jet

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,039
man

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
by julian the court he's culinary from

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,720
los angeles he calls a doctor in

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,880
robotics from epfl

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,080
and currently working as an r d engineer

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,240
at flybotics

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,680
he is the science and engineering

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,240
consultant for jetman

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,480
ive rossi help the jet man develop a

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,600
hover flight stabilization system

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,440
for jet powered wing and intuitive

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:41,760
pilot wing interfaces on body movements

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,920
in this session he will show how the px4

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,719
ecosystem enabled the world's first btol

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,360
flight with

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,079
wearable ring capable of a maximum speed

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,360
of 350 kilometers per hour

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,879
and a maximum altitude of 5 000 meters

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,480
the presentation will focus on both

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,920
technical safety aspects of the project

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,520
it will contain the behind-the-scenes

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,399
images from test flights

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,800
i'm really excited please welcome uh dr

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,800
julian

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,280
julian this oh yeah and we're live

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,080
everybody

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,880
i'm live okay hello everybody welcome

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,520
thank you

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,720
go ahead that's great pleasure to be

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,320
here today

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,439
to present you uh this project it was

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,600
very an amazing project um so let me

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:31,119
share my screen

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,000
all right so is it a drone is it a plane

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,439
no it's chatman so this is a project

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,479
where we have

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,479
achieved the world first

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,600
vertical takeoff and landing with a

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,200
manned

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,880
aircraft jet powered that is capable of

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,520
flying

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
almost 400 kilometers an hour and 5 000

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
meters high

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,759
um of course working on the manned

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,560
aircraft was very intense and but that

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,960
was

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,880
i think best project i've had the

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,920
opportunity to work on

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,759
and on the top of that eve rossi who has

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,399
developed the wing

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
he's a wonderful person and i'm very

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
glad that i've

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,280
met him so if you don't know him here is

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
a short video that describes what he has

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,360
achieved with

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,200
his wing

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,879
well this next story you have to see to

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,480
believe the latest chapter in the

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,959
amazing adventures of

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,800
jet man this time he's really outdone

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,840
himself soaring to new heights

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,840
even superman might be envious of

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,640
with a pilot known as jet man will soar

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,640
across wisconsin later today

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,879
rossi invited us to come along as he

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,280
flew beside this v17

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:19,840
vintage bomber this is the kind of

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,840
formation plot you don't usually see

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,799
[Applause]

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,239
there is no turning back now he is over

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,599
the english channel

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:47,840
and underway ladies and gentlemen

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:47,840
has landed in england

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:15,840
because i don't want to become a salami

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
so

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,440
so if you look up in the sky around the

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,440
us and think it's a bird with the brain

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,080
all right so pretty impressive right

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,680
when you've done all this what do you

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,400
want to do next i mean

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,919
flying formation flight with aircraft

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,360
going in the grand canyon

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,479
crossing the english channel well do

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,280
everest has been dedicated on a journey

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,400
to

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,800
feel the flight like a bird would do

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
well we're talking about very specific

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
kind of birds that have

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,919
jet engines but yeah that's that's

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,720
that's the idea and one

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,199
missing part is the door vertical

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,080
takeoff and landing

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,400
right now a flight looks like this you

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,759
go

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,080
up using a helicopter and then once you

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,880
reach a safe altitude around a thousand

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,160
meters

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,000
of the ground then the pilot jumps out

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,639
of the helicopter then gains

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,160
speed and then can fly and do loops

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,320
whatever he wants

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,919
at the end of the flight he has to open

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,280
a parachute to go down

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,400
safely what would be awesome

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,680
would be to remove the helicopter from

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,280
the equation

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,800
that would reduce the cost tremendously

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,440
and also make it way cooler and

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
even better would be to also remove the

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,880
parachute

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:12,080
so you don't need anymore to be an

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
experienced paraglider

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,440
to to operate the wing

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,600
but that's pretty challenging so

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,039
what do we do how do we how do we get

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,319
there

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,319
first thing we need is safety

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,560
so you will see throughout this

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,639
presentation safety was always

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,039
first and it should be and

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,880
up until before this project here rossi

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,840
was always playing at high altitude

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,120
because that's where you have the safety

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,759
of the parachute

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,800
if you are higher than 800 meters above

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,639
the ground you have

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
time to open a parachute in case

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,039
something goes wrong

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,280
you even have the time to eject the wing

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,160
which will then land with its own

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,199
parachute

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,840
and open the second safety parachute

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,639
when you go down close to the ground

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
that's where

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,400
it's getting really dangerous so i will

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
say it

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,199
once maybe repeat it during the

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,120
presentation do not try this at home

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,560
um unless you really do what you're

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,479
doing it's

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,319
very dangerous to fly close to the

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,440
ground and you will see that we have

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
taken

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,440
all the measures we could to ensure the

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,639
safety and px4 was

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:31,039
never the last remaining safety measure

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,919
we always have always had a backup

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,520
right second thing we need is power

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
obviously if we want to take off

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,759
vertically you need to sustain your

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,720
weight and even more

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,160
for this we are covered because the wing

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,440
is now equipped with four

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,080
jet cat engines that each deliver 55

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,120
newtons

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,319
of uh uh of 55 kilos of

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,680
thrust um

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,240
considering that the weight of the wing

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,240
plus

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,240
the pilot plus the fuel is 180 kilos

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,160
that means that you have a thrust to

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,680
weight ratio larger than one

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,199
you can go up vertically at 180

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,319
kilometers an hour

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,520
which is the speed that you fall

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,639
down when you do freefall

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,759
right and last thing you need is

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,560
control here i'll take a step back

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,039
and mention something that i haven't yet

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,720
there

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:34,000
are no flaps on the wing if rossi

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:37,440
wants to feel the flight like a bird

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,440
and he uses body movements to control

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,959
the flight there are no joysticks no

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,000
flaps on the wing

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,120
in order to roll he twists the

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,839
shoulders to go left or right uh if

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,480
he moves the torso forward it will pitch

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,800
down

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,080
also back pitch up and move the head to

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,800
do a bit of yo

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
and that's it and actually there were

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,800
tests

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,040
done in a wind tunnel that showed

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,880
that the wing design should not be

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,519
stable

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,000
however this particular design was used

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,920
to cross

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,680
the english channel so that's to tell

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,399
that having a human on board

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,279
actually controlling the platform is

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,600
really

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,839
something different from what we have

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,240
what we are used

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,800
to to do with drones that are entirely

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,160
rigid

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,200
and robotic platforms

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
so knowing that the first trial was made

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,839
without

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,959
any stabilization system and

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,959
here you can see all right

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,839
now that you've heard the nose i will

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,000
mute all the videos

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,440
what you can see on this video is that

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,160
the thrust

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,519
is controllable manually there is only a

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,000
potentiometer in the hand

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,080
that controls the thrust and that's

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,640
enough to control the altitude however

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
the all

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:03,120
the other axes are not stable enough

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,160
on the rolling pitch it drifts very

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,200
quickly

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,720
and on yo you have no control at all so

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,120
the solution to that

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,120
is oops

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,880
yeah the solution to that is to use

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,440
a thrust vector system so

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,320
press entering nozzles here in red on

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,800
the

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,399
on the drawing were added in order to

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,399
deviate the airflow

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,160
left and right and front and back on two

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,640
of the engines

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
in order to make the flight controllable

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:45,279
then as i said before the idea with this

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,079
wing is to be as intuitive as possible

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,560
to let you

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,680
control the flight as if you were flying

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,480
you

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,440
you should not feel the wing behind your

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
back

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,880
and the way we achieved

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,480
this during hover flight is the

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,399
following

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,519
the wing here uh

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:11,360
pictured with uh an airfoil is

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:16,800
uh stabilized in order to stay level

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:20,000
like like it is on this picture and then

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,640
when the pilot will move its torso

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,160
forward it will offset the center of

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,519
mass

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,920
for what which will be

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,240
considered as a disturbance from the

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
point of view of the controller

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,160
wind gust body movements are all

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,200
considered disturbances for the for the

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,760
controller

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,480
then as a reaction the controller will

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,920
align

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,680
the thrust vector with the center of

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,079
mass so that the platform does not tilt

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,360
and

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:56,240
the wing remains level

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,120
but now we have a new stable

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,480
equilibrium point where we have a

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,320
forward component of thrust

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,040
which means the platform is moving

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
forward so that makes it very intuitive

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,360
to fly

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,519
you move forward the platform moves

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
forward you move backwards

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,560
the same thing happens the tilt vector

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,760
will move

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,760
and it will move backwards

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:22,160
right so let's put that in practice

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
we need a test pilot and i'll introduce

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,079
you

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:29,120
a check chuck was the brave first

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,040
test pilot of the platform and

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,519
although he's made of plastic he is

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:36,639
nonetheless a very proud and

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:40,079
talented pilot he

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:43,120
the test with chuck allowed to tune

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,720
roughly a pid controller

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,880
um that was then used

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:54,639
on realflight with evoc on board

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:59,120
so here you can notice a safety harness

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,320
that limits the movements of the pilot

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,399
so that it can never touch the walls

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,959
both on the top and on the bottom

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,440
uh so we have taken measures so that

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:14,160
nothing wrong can happen

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
here you can see the wing flying with

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,680
the stock

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:23,040
pid of pixel pixel

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,240
um no no big change in the code

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,639
just some tuning so one might say that

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,600
the tuning is not correct and here i

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,959
will pause

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,480
whoa yeah just a reminder that

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,040
things can go wrong very quickly so

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,880
it was very important to take the safety

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,639
measures for that

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,480
yeah so that's the closest we've been to

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,760
to an incident it was nothing nothing

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,399
bad but

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,959
we are happy that we have taken safety

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,720
measures

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,600
uh precisely for that type of uh

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,639
of event well i was saying that some

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,440
might say that

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,480
the tuning was not great on on this

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,680
flight

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,240
and they're probably right but the thing

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,680
is

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:13,760
you have to consider that each flight is

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:17,440
only a few minutes and we can do

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,560
only two three or sometimes four flights

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,760
a day

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,720
because it takes some time to prepare

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,519
and it requires up to five people to

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,360
operate

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,199
like to have all the safety measures we

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,760
wanted

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,320
um so it was very time consuming to to

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,639
tune

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,360
uh the controller so instead the

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,279
approach

00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:43,040
that i've taken was to

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,079
to do some system identification here

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,519
we are looking at a roll and pitch

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,240
jerk um that were

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,000
measured from the flight i just showed

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,279
so in blue you have the measured

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
jerk and in orange you have the

00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,440
predicted jerk

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,800
predicted from the actuator movements

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,000
you can see that we can have

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,680
pretty good modeling of the platform

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,720
and this was used in a model based

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,320
control that replaced the pid

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,399
controller existing in px4

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,519
and here i wanted to show this short

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,600
video because

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,440
this was the first test of this new

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,000
controller and

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,480
it was very nice moment because you can

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,519
see

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,600
in his highs that well that's the moment

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,040
we both knew it would be working right

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,040
he's testing the strength of the

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,279
controller and

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:41,759
then here yeah he's he knows that it's

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:45,040
it's really strong and that it will work

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:48,560
so that that was very exciting

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,040
um okay now that we have

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,600
uh something that is able to stabilize

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,959
the

00:15:51,600 --> 00:16:00,000
the flight we need to prepare for

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:03,440
outdoor flight so a bit of architecture

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:07,279
in the wing we have a pixel

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,720
that has a few custom

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,800
applications running the first one is

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
called the jet guy command it's

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,839
basically

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:21,360
an application that replaces um

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,160
the the commander and we

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,880
wanted to have as much control as

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,079
possible

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,279
on the behavior of the system and we

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,199
could not afford

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,480
the system to switch mode i don't know

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:36,000
like go to land

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:37,199
or disarm without us knowing so what jet

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
guy commanders

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,320
is when all the safety checks are passed

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:47,600
and the button is pressed he

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,920
then forces the system to off-board mode

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,639
so it's an off-board mode that is

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:53,040
triggered by

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,440
on-board applications it's a bit

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,560
backwards but it's the best way we found

00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,759
to have a good control on the behavior

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,880
of the system

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,720
and and be sure

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:08,319
that it follows our state machine so

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,400
speaking about that i'm very excited

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,799
about the ongoing work on

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,720
state machines because it will make px4

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,240
much more

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,839
much easier to comprehend and to easier

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,959
to assess what the behavior of the

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,120
system is

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,640
right now that was the best uh the best

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,039
solution for us there is also

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,200
a jet guide control which implements the

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,480
the controller and button that handles

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,320
the the

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,280
the the button state um

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,039
on the left we can see that we have

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,880
added a second pixel

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:46,080
in the helmet and this pixock

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,600
also runs custom apps um

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,080
one use is to provide information to the

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,799
pilot

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,679
through an led about the state of the

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,960
system

00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,160
and the second use is to give

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,360
commands to the controller your commands

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
and a bit of trimming on the role and on

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,760
the world and

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,000
in pitch and on the right side we have

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,280
a non-trig non-critical part of the

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,640
system which is

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,280
a raspberry pi running a web server

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,799
exposing the state of the system and

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
then a smartphone on the ground

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,160
that is very useful when we set up the

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,200
system

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:28,080
to know that everything is fine all the

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,960
estimators are healthy and all the

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,960
batteries are charged

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,280
okay and with all this

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,720
here is an example of the

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:45,360
kind of flight that we achieved this was

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:48,000
i think about um a year ago today

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,880
um so let me fast forward a bit where it

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,760
takes off

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:57,360
oh i can no i can't apparently

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,520
um well the point is it's

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,640
very very stable and according to the

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,039
pilot

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,919
it's very easy to fly you don't have to

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,640
do a lot of

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,440
uh crazy motion to stabilize the system

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,400
you just

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,520
lean backward let it move backwards then

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,559
you turn the head

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:15,360
and it just follows move forward and it

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,840
moves forward

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,840
that's apparently very very easy to fly

00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:29,280
um right then uh

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,559
we prepared for the outdoor experiment

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,440
um removing uh

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:38,000
the safety barriers one by one always

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:41,200
being precocious so the first test was

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,480
going outdoor with a light breeze

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,720
and with the

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:53,440
upward anchor removed and but the

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:57,200
downward wire was kept for safety

00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,000
and then we did first hops

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,960
on the boat so thanks to sagar for for

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,360
lending us

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
the boat it was very great it was a

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,640
short flight

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,440
but it was the first that was completely

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,880
unfettered

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,200
it was very very exciting uh and

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,360
the whole team was was super happy after

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
that

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,000
um and finally here is

00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,600
uh the flight that we've done

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,080
on the shore the first vertical takeoff

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:30,000
completely autonomous no remote no

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:35,840
joystick

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,840
only body motion to drive the flights

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,769
[Applause]

00:20:55,290 --> 00:20:58,490
[Applause]

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,919
[Applause]

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,960
okay right so

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,120
what next at the beginning of the

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,600
presentation i promised you

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
that we could remove the helicopter from

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
the equation

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,760
take off from the ground have fun in the

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,120
air and then land

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:42,400
we are not quite there actually uh

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,880
here i highlight all the zones where we

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,320
have flown so very low on the ground

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,400
less than two meters

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,080
above the ground we have flown a bit

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,799
higher above water

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,960
because in case of failure that's a safe

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,000
splash down

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,559
we have flown higher than

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,320
800 meters because that's where you have

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,000
the safety of the parachute

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:10,000
and there we tried forward flight

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,360
vertical flight transitions both ways

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
all works great uh eve has also

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,480
developed

00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,520
um a ballistic parachute

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:25,840
that allows to open a parachute

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:27,760
down to 200 meters altitude

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,679
but there the vertical flight was not

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,039
tested yet

00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,799
and what's missing is the blank area you

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,200
can see between 10 meters

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,679
and 200 meters there

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,240
we don't have a system to ensure safety

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,120
yet

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,520
and that's somewhere we will not go

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,559
until we have the safety measures

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,240
to to go there um so if you are

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:57,120
a manufacturer of a system that provides

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,120
safety down to 10 meters then please

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,919
contact us

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,919
otherwise we we will not do that for now

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,400
and if you see anyone doing it or

00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,799
claiming that it's okay

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,919
it's according to me and to eve it's

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,919
just irresponsible

00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,600
it's just taking too much risks right

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,120
to finish the presentation i would like

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,440
to show you this

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,020
short video because i find it wonderful

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
it was

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,520
[Applause]

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,799
after trials of transition

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,080
at high altitude eve spotted

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,520
a nice cloud and decided that the test

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,280
session was over

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,480
and he started to climb

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,360
4 000 meters altitude and

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,919
started to play into the into the clouds

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,360
which is

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,159
very wonderful and yeah

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,440
on that video i will look at your i'm

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,919
sure many questions

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,919
and i thank you for for your attention

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,840
hi julian can you hear me yeah i can

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,360
thank you awesome that was awesome um

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,440
let me share some questions from the

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,440
community with you real quick

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,760
uh can you do me a favor can you um

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,039
share your screen for now

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:20,320
yeah all right then

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:23,120
yeah yeah uh wait for those questions um

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,840
community please go to the px4 slack

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,559
channel for

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,279
the px4 dev summit uh one thing by

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,360
julian here

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,520
live on stream uh he's on the hook now

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,039
so jillian can you go to the slack

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,320
channel and share some of those videos

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,840
with the community that would be really

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,960
cool

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,840
uh yep i'll do awesome all right so

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,400
uh questions uh trusters are they

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,200
electro

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,960
electronic uh fuel based uh if so which

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,400
fields

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,360
so the thrusters are fuel based these

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,600
are gas turbines that run on the jet

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,400
fuel

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,440
so if the question was about the

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,720
environment

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:06,240
environmental aspects um yes it pollutes

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,400
uh a lot it uh consumes

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:14,640
30 liters in eight minute flights so

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:17,679
it it it is gas based but the

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,720
the power to great ratio of these uh

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,720
gas turbines is just unbeatable you have

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,760
a gas turbine of five kilos that

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:28,000
produces 55 kilograms of thrust

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,120
and it's all contained in a small

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,039
package

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,039
uh you cannot afford to have large

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,799
propellers on on this platform

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:38,799
so for now that's the only solution

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,559
great thank you another question is what

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,240
is the reason behind the decision

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:48,080
to not have control services

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:51,200
so that that's by design um

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:55,039
the goal according to heath to eve

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,080
was to get out of the cockpit

00:25:55,039 --> 00:26:01,600
when you are in a cockpit you

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,080
are driven by the aircraft you

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,279
move the joystick and then some

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,400
mechanics

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,880
happen the aircraft moves and then you

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,159
follow the aircraft on this wing that's

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,600
the opposite

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,240
you are moving and then the wing follows

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,039
you

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,440
so it's completely different uh feeling

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,720
and

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,559
that's that's the goal of the project

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,840
great thank you okay so i'm gonna leave

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,000
some of those questions

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,600
uh for you to answer on slack um

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,720
there's a lot of good interesting

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,000
questions but i think they're better

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,120
answered by you on

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,440
uh on slack asynchronously

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,159
thank you again for being here today all

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
right thank you

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,640
for your presentation and i look forward

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,159
for the following presentations

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,159
thank you bye-bye thank you

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,120
all right uh hi your host here from

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,840
phone speaking

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,679
please join me in taking julian decor um

00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,000
i'm concerned by chuck's

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,039
safety now we gotta check on that safety

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,760
pilot

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,799
and uh just a quick note before we

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,960
continue please

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:11,200
like julian said don't try this at home

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,960
this is done by professionals

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,240
don't try this at home that's not why

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,799
px4 exists there's a reason uh

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,480
there's safety in embedded into the

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,159
application please

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,159
