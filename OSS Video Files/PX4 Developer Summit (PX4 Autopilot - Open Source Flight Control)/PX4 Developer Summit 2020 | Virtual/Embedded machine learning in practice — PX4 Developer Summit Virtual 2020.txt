	Title: Embedded machine learning in practice 

Summary: TinyML is a global community of software engineers and data scientists working together to bring more intelligence to sensors on embedded devices. This movement has enabled a wide range of applications on the tiniest of devices, from predictive maintenance to object detection to sound recognition. In systems where decision-making needs to happen in real-time, it is important that the processing can be done as close as possible to the data source - enhancing security and cutting down on network energy consumption, latency, and bandwidth usage.

During this talk, you will learn why you should consider doing ML even on the most constrained computing devices available to you and how to get started in practice.

The PX4 Developer Summit 2020 is the annual flagship conference hosted by Dronecode for the drone development community. https://bit.ly/2YXe4Rd
