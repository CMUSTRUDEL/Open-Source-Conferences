really happy to be here

00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:21,730
welcome to the tube the px4 developer

00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:26,179
summit thanks to everyone for joining in

00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:31,580
we had a great day yesterday there was a

00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:33,410
lot of community driven talks thank you

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:35,150
everyone that joint slack to join the

00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,250
chatroom Jones social media and followed

00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,410
us you guys are doing great

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,989

from that summit hashtag if you're here

00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,070
to watch the px4 developer summit you're

00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:09,619
the right channel I'm from Andrade I'm

00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:12,320
the project manager for drunk code we

00:01:09,619 --> 00:01:13,939
have a great event today coming up I

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,700
want to say a few things

00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:19,549
announcements for the day we had awesome

stats on they want we had around 400

00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:25,340
average viewers yesterday on YouTube

00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,470
Facebook Twitter we also had around 400

00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:31,579
on Billy Billy which is the Chinese

00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:33,049
mirror in total around 800 that's

awesome

00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:38,030
social medias blowing up the hashtag

00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:41,659
thank you again we got a couple hiccups

00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:43,579
own audio yesterday same as today well

00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:44,930
make sure we got those so thank you for

00:01:43,579 --> 00:01:48,520
your response thank you for the feedback

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:50,479
let us know we're here we're listening

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,520
there's going to be a few additions

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:59,719
today today we're going to have pulse on

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,479
slack during the livestream when we're

00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:05,360
switching from speaker to speaker we're

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,399
gonna throw a few polls on slack so we

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,160
make sure your joints lock there's going

00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:09,960
to be

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,790
community volunteers sharing the links

00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:16,980
on stream there's going to be also

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:18,720
ratings so go to get the event

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,760
management platform you can also rate

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,790
the sessions from yesterday you can also

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,470
do that from the sessions today please

00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,720
do so it's gonna help the speaker it's

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,960
gonna help us organize a better event in

00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,150
the future let's see what we got next

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,860
the live recordings thank you for asking

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,100
for those there's gonna be available to

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,600
three days after this ends video

00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,280
proceeding team is really recent right

00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,750
now putting together everything you're

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,350
seeing on screen today so give us a few

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:50,790
days before we upload the end products

00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,530
for those if you're on slack please let

00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,660
us know share your LinkedIn profiles

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,940
share your social media share pictures

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,390
if you're looking for a job

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,300
jump on slack say hi if you're a company

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:05,490
trying to recruit px4 developers jump on

00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,220
our slack post your LinkedIn post post

00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,830
your careers pages let's strive to make

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,360
this the best event possible who we can

00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:16,500
and lastly there's going to be

00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,190
not-so-secret afterparty

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:23,220
that's gonna happen 3 to 5 p.m. Pacific

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,780
but here's the catch that's only going

00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,360
to be unlocked there's going to be a

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,580
link chart in there please make sure you

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,290
go to slack and get the name bite to

00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,520
that it's not gonna be churn on YouTube

00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,100
it's not gonna be straight to Facebook

00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:37,320
or Twitter only on slug so make sure you

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,380
go back to slack reach out to the

00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:42,989
community volunteers and get an invite

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,530
having said that I think it's time we

00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:51,209
introduce our speakers for today the

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,890
first speakers a single he got next so

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:54,720
looks like we got big sock

00:03:52,890 --> 00:04:00,510
community-driven open standards for

00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:03,600
drones and we got one two three four

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,380
five speakers we got Peter from

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,420
Netherlands

00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:09,300
Alex Kalani from Salt Lake City us

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,610
Michael from Zurich Switzerland Lawrence

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,000
also calling from Zurich nuna from

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:17,620
Portugal and we're starting the day off

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,030
with a great panel

00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,150
look forward from this session guys

00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:24,340
thank you again for being here don't go

00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:26,410
anywhere I'll be back after the session

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:30,790
ends and thank you again for being here

00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:32,860
stand by while I connect you welcome

00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,180
back to the px4 developers summit my

00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:37,330
name is Roman broach I'm the host for

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,740
today I present you the pixel panel

00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,470
pixel community-driven

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,270
open standards for drones that picks up

00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,250
open standards provides related standard

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,040
available harbor specification and

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,840
guidelines for drone system development

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,070
does pixel special interest group is

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,720
that network of companies that are

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:54,970
innovators on maintenance of the pixel

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,060
reference standard I'm joined today with

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,100
the leads for that special interest

00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:02,169
group this group meets every Tuesday

00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:05,410
we've been meeting for the last couple

00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:07,770
months doing tremendous work for Pixar I

00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:10,900
am really excited for this talk and

00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:18,190
without further ado I introduce you to

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:22,479
the panel hi everybody so finally we're

00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:25,300
on thank you for the introduction Ramon

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,450
I will be quickly introducing the

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,479
background of each panelist because our

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:34,560
goal here is to have a really hands-on

00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:39,039
live discussion this is not pre-recorded

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:43,510
we do not we did not prepare any

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,990
specific points to present so we have

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,150
here Luna Marcus Nuno has worked in the

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,849
last month specifically on the

00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:56,979
high-level can and onboard messaging and

00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:59,530
well I have a lot of questions for him

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,199
why that's important how that's useful

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,970
we have peterfreund apart from the park

00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:10,419
from NXP he is deeply familiar with the

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:13,240
transport layer on can NSP is the

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:17,650
leading software combat or a hardware

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:20,860
company in the automotive space and they

00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:25,169
have lots of experience with for example

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:28,210
can there and safety we have Alex who

00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:30,150
joins us alex is running his own

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:33,300
electronics company

00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,580
with that has looked very deeply into

00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,560
smart batteries and what it takes to

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:40,290
really take this ecosystem to the next

00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,690
level and finally we have Michael

00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:44,610
Michael has been the product manager of

00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:47,910
Sky node which is a very integrated

00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,490
avionics solution and is also very

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:55,020
deeply involved in the standardization

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:59,820
efforts around pixhawk standard

00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:03,289
evolution so the first topic that we'd

00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,919
like to dive into on this panel is

00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:09,570
onboard

00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:12,330
avionics and how we build networks on

00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:15,650
board a lot of you who are familiar with

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:20,960
drones will know that there's this

00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:23,490
inheritance from hobby parts and so the

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,789
interface is so far have been extremely

00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:29,880
minimal for example with PWM and so the

00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:32,310
first question to you Nana would be like

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,680
you know I can't connect motor

00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,760
controllers and servos and everything

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,630
right now like what what why do I need

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,840
something else why do I need a standard

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:46,560
yeah

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,430
so we inherited most of the best of its

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,880
applications or will be the usage of PWM

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,700
my splits in spy particles for the

00:07:53,880 --> 00:08:01,320
reflow connects me to explore the most

00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:04,220
we use PWM for ESC control I scratch

00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:09,120
against five for sensor data collection

00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:12,770
but these are these are functional these

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:17,970
these protocols have known for once

00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:20,789
regarding regarding reliability right so

00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:24,599
there are some specifics to the

00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:27,320
technology that make them probably not

00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,960
suited for safety critical system

00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:33,029
systems that require a much more robust

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,050
layering and depth that work is not just

00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:39,180
applied to communication between central

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,829
control and 118 years it's which

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,140
basically connects to the different

00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:43,500
peripherals or avionic components but

00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,310
also

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,220
for firstly regarding distributed a UNIX

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:53,730
system as we talked about so besides

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:58,080
that there's the need for that master on

00:08:53,730 --> 00:09:00,390
those buses removes the ability of

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,180
having this ability of young system

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,640
which is capable of working with the

00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:08,820
central units or it's capable of working

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,280
but without that central units that

00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:15,450
defines addresses that defines data

00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:18,840
waste etc and that's why the usage of of

00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:23,190
care on a you know on a young systems we

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:27,450
can say much more relevant as can brings

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:31,260
these peer-to-peer network capability

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:35,390
we'd no need for for a metaphor master

00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:38,670
right okay you know that's great but

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:42,540
there are already can parts a lot of

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:44,370
them even DG is using cans so why why

00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,910
are you working on a on a message

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:50,790
standard for that yes so if if we

00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:54,330
consider that each each each vendor

00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:58,920
actually defines their own hand code of

00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:01,740
all even if Lane is the same physical

00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,830
protocol as Chancellor could also be or

00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,290
can s be if they're using or they feel

00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:11,130
of their own protocol stack and

00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:16,230
specification that will basically mean

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:19,040
that for for an interoperable component

00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:22,140
that we're trying to achieve right

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,120
hardware vendors in a mystical there's

00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:27,510
basically consuming that same hardware

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,150
will have problems in actually having

00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,390
their components or there are actually

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:35,910
compatible we immediately with the

00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:39,240
different systems so having in its

00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:43,170
standard actually assures that we can

00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,110
guarantee that interoperability and at

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:49,490
the same time we are the vendors and the

00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:51,839
idler the other manufacturers are also

00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:54,270
making sure they are complying with

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,540
cedar specific set of rules and

00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:56,540
requirements

00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:04,670
and they know also that them their

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:07,320
product is also plug-and-play okay so

00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,720
essentially the key takeaway is with

00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,600
that message standard I can just connect

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:15,240
I don't know a servo or motor controller

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
to my commercial drone and it will just

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,769
work

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,860
no no software changes yes exactly

00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:25,320
okay very cool so one of the things that

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,820
I find personally be confusing and I'm

00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:29,940
sure a lot of people in the audience

00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:33,870
will have similar questions is like you

00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:37,170
know what we already have have UD can V

00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:43,110
zero now we're moving to you you can be

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:47,420
one as part of that proposal so how how

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:51,570
is that related isn't you we can already

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:53,970
defining what we're doing so I'm

00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:59,250
confused there Peter maybe maybe you can

00:11:53,970 --> 00:12:02,910
help me there yeah so there were

00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:05,370
multiple reasons why Pavel the designer

00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:10,920
and the new African team decided to go

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:14,430
for the one but it's mainly it's mainly

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:18,750
because they wanted to move forward to a

00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:22,610
one good generic system but also support

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,610
for can FD as well

00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:27,140
where policies are marring a lot of

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:33,740
noise

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:33,740
[Applause]

00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:44,279
yes we're back again so with the lessons

00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,860
learned from z0 the designers from your

00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:49,880
vegan decided to come with a clean slate

00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:55,019
and designed a new protocol that's

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:58,889
simpler and also it's useful for a

00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:02,430
safety critical application so they want

00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:07,620
to support redundancy so that's inside

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:13,920
this this protocol and yeah keep it as

00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:16,880
simple as possible I think okay so

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,699
essentially what you're saying is that

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:24,720
on the protocol level this is a really

00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:27,630
solid base to build on but it's it's not

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,980
specifying everything up to the sort of

00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:35,639
full implementation messages and and and

00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:39,180
that's essentially how the Diaz 15

00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:43,380
standard comes in yes

00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:45,990
so the when you look at the transport

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:51,350
layers we have fair canvas which just

00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,350
basic has basic frames and your V can

00:13:56,750 --> 00:14:02,220
should send big frames on canvas and you

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,339
don't have to worry about the framing of

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:07,889
those messages but here is kind of where

00:14:05,339 --> 00:14:11,639
your V can stops so distilled

00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:15,329
interoperability between a let's say a

00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,370
motor and fmu is not there and the main

00:14:15,329 --> 00:14:20,130
goal is that if someone implements such

00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:23,220
a motor controller they can follow the

00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:27,420
Diaz 15 rules and have a easy to plug

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,550
and play system furthermore as a fine

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,550
management unit we know what we expect

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:34,860
from those components and we have an

00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:36,660
interface where we can leverage that

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,480
through for instance include a

00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,620
bootloader or have a mechanism to easily

00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,620
set up those components

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:48,920
okay so it's pretty much like like

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,529
having used B of course not literally

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,870
but equivalent like I can just connect a

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:55,699
device and it'll work

00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,320
yeah that that's the main goal of it the

00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:02,329
mango is having a plug and play

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:05,779
experience and well still be able to go

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:08,360
deeper if you really want to but but

00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,730
also for the implementer it has to be

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,940
clear rules on what your device has to

00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:17,769
support so from both sides you can

00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:21,560
integrate to a nice tightly with brother

00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:24,170
yeah that makes a lot of sense so if if

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:27,100
I'm interested to to contribute there

00:15:24,170 --> 00:15:30,259
and if I'm interested to make my device

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:33,290
compatible or if I just generally care

00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:46,100
about this like how do i how do I engage

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:49,850
no no you know you're muted sorry

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:51,260
okay can you hear me so yeah so we have

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,060
the you if you can intense

00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:57,230
standardization coordination fall that

00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:59,750
happens on bi-weekly on Tuesdays at 4

00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,569
p.m. et si you can check it from

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:05,860
calendar and add that event to your

00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:09,589
calendar as well so basically that depth

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:13,130
that standardization or coordination

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:15,410
call is mostly used to foster the

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:18,560
coordination and collaboration among the

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:22,940
adopters and also the stakeholders of

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,399
the unmanned avionics industry and those

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,649
might include on net they're not limited

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:31,760
to of course the hardware manufacturers

00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:35,439
and and vendors and also am an aviation

00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:39,529
leading companies that use specific

00:16:35,439 --> 00:16:43,550
avionics components that leverage can or

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:45,620
a weekend and mostly what what happens

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:49,130
on those on those calls as a specific

00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:53,040
goal we try to discuss and organize the

00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:58,050
efforts around writing and improving

00:16:53,040 --> 00:17:01,440
PSO 15 can Jones tender then it involves

00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:05,339
some open discussions over the specific

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,690
matters of the standard also reviewing

00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:12,930
what was the work done on the past two

00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,880
couple of weeks and the added and

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:17,580
updated components verifies they make

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,390
sense or not and of course also defined

00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:24,360
the girls for the course of work on the

00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,839
next couple of weeks so we can say can

00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,390
say you will see it like a scrum a daily

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:35,190
scrum call but like week happened

00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:50,750
bi-weekly adding also the poker removing

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:52,020
you can say it's go can you hear me yes

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:55,320
yep

00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,680
okay cool so remark maybe you can share

00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,210
the links with the audience in the chat

00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:04,680
while we're talking so people can engage

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:08,850
otherwise I can I can follow up in the

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:10,610
chat later after this as well that's why

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:12,560
you know thanks very much and already Oh

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:17,670
perfect

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:20,640
so now that brings us to the next topic

00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:24,180
so I already mentioned that Alex has

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,680
particularly experience with batteries

00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:32,570
so I mean I've been using lipo batteries

00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:35,390
for the past ten years on um sort of

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:39,180
development systems or in these systems

00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:41,610
like why why do we need to change that

00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:46,740
why do we need to change to a different

00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:49,770
approach use of using batteries yeah I

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:52,590
think for the for the pixhawk hardware

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:54,720
ecosystem to really evolve we need smart

00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:58,200
batteries are kind of that last that

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,580
last key thing to bring the safety and

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,399
reliability up to the next level

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,789
hi I'm from YouTube I gave a good talk

00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:08,500
yesterday on the technical background on

00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:12,450
how smart batteries operate but

00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:15,429
ultimately it's you can get the full

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:18,010
full capacity out of the pack safely

00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:20,559
without having to worry about completely

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:24,070
running out too early so you can fly

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,769
your drones longer and safer with small

00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:34,809
entities so that's kind of goal of the

00:19:26,769 --> 00:19:38,620
smart battery standard okay so how is

00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:40,360
how is the standard in what state is it

00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,299
how is it being developed what are the

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,539
next concrete steps for smart batteries

00:19:43,299 --> 00:19:50,019
yeah so so far we've got the you know

00:19:46,539 --> 00:19:51,820
order we've defined the connector we've

00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:56,500
got the connector the pinout defined

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:58,240
we've got the messaging set to find the

00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:02,139
communication interface that's gonna be

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:06,070
on the can bus with maybe can be one and

00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:08,620
as part of that UAB can standard they

00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,659
were just discussing we've defined the

00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,880
battery message set that all smart

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:16,960
batteries to meet the pixhawk standard

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,720
will abide by so the being on the can

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,970
bus and using UAV can will allow

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,419
multiple batteries in parallel to be

00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:29,049
used much easier than just using sm bus

00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:32,110
that was one main main driver there the

00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:34,330
next steps are defining that mechanical

00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:37,299
interface and matching that's probably

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:40,360
the next big hurdle otherwise most of

00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:44,950
the most of the electrical and protocol

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:47,620
is it's in place at the moment that's

00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:49,899
super cool when when do you expect from

00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,889
from the adopting companies to see the

00:20:49,899 --> 00:20:55,570
first products on the market yes oh I'm

00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:58,899
I'm partnered with holy bro at the

00:20:55,570 --> 00:21:01,210
moment to bring bring the first pixhawk

00:20:58,899 --> 00:21:03,399
smart battery to the market so that

00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,980
should be sometime this year you should

00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:10,000
see that on the market and that'll be

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:13,370
that'll be a 99.9 watt our success pack

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:18,740
something you can carry on a plane

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:22,480
and yeah it's pretty exciting I think it

00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:25,970
is I have met people who were

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,340
essentially saying like Otis open-source

00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:30,890
fly control work is really great and

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,770
we're really happy with it but as long

00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:38,570
as our end users have to use batteries

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:42,610
that have leads and that have to be

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:45,800
actually you know dialed in on a charger

00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:47,150
we can't sell that to our end users it

00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,430
needs to be something that just gets

00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:55,010
stuck into charger and that never gets

00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:58,270
deep discharged and so I think that's

00:21:55,010 --> 00:22:03,910
that's as important as the radio link

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:06,650
very very cool so the natural evolution

00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:10,400
we've talked about the network we've

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:12,740
talked about you can as a transport v1

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,150
we've talked about the message set for

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:19,880
that as part of the Diaz 15 standard

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:22,600
that naturally takes us to a part that

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:25,370
is already in pretty good shape already

00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:30,080
which is the flight controller itself

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:35,380
pixhawk and the fact that we've

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:39,830
open-sourced the harbor design 2013-14

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:41,960
so already six years ago led to a lot of

00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:43,940
compatible designs because people were

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,690
mostly happy with it and didn't change

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:50,540
too much and so it just worked but over

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:54,530
the time there was more discretion and

00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:56,240
so today we have I don't know 10 15

00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:59,450
different types of flight controller

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,540
designs they're all Pixar derived but

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,830
they're a little bit different and

00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,510
sometimes the hardware vendors are

00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:09,380
relatively small companies and they

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:12,320
struggle to maintain software so that is

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:16,430
obviously obviously the segue Michael to

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,010
the question to you which is why six

00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:21,320
years after seven six seven years after

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:25,049
the first Pixar do we need to

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,340
standardize this why do we need standard

00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:30,179
for flight controllers and flight

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:32,190
controller interfaces as your honor

00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,610
mentioned they have been like a ride fly

00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:37,169
controller designs over the years and

00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:38,580
I'm offering I would say the more

00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:39,419
successful too rough to get arrested

00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,100
faster

00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:44,070
that's a issues from a fan perspective

00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:46,259
from power supply perspective or just

00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,899
the support for no we welcome you to

00:23:46,259 --> 00:23:51,659
effort on behalf of the lines now

00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:53,340
penalizing an interface and the

00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:55,710
interface between stops I'm half in that

00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,139
space really means that there is a

00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,090
pretty defined standard and how I can be

00:23:58,139 --> 00:24:02,580
defied consolidated fully supported by

00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:04,289
the software side and both and please

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,619
know what they were encounter and it's

00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:09,269
like it is a seamless transition that it

00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:12,869
just gives confidence for an empty with

00:24:09,269 --> 00:24:15,450
it you can buy a product that is you

00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:20,879
also knows that px-41 nicely on that

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:25,350
platform okay that sounds fairly

00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:27,509
important what what does that mean for

00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,419
future upgrades so we know there are

00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:32,220
always new processors there are new

00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:37,559
processors coming from nxp with

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:40,999
automotive safety features how how does

00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:44,190
this one standard help us in that regard

00:24:40,999 --> 00:24:45,419
this so currently integrating a flight

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:48,509
controller in a specific vehicle

00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:50,009
typically means also integrating against

00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:52,799
an interface that is defined by the

00:24:50,009 --> 00:24:54,960
manufacturer or vendor or a commercial

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,059
or industrial theater the dolphin

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,289
inquires to design a current PCB that

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:00,720
their interfaces to the flight

00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:02,489
controller by introducing a standard

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,799
like to think of all the pilot bus is a

00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:07,259
way to complete this standard instead an

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,119
open it up to the market to develop a

00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:11,460
flight controller and that is been all

00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:14,220
the future compatible to in aircraft

00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:16,619
that follows the same interface the

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,720
standard has a pin out if you find the

00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:20,999
connector on it it has in a chemical

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,859
layout and both in size and how its

00:25:20,999 --> 00:25:25,379
mounted in the other connector subpage

00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:26,519
so if a drone OEM decides to integrate

00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:28,559
against it's then that it's not just

00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,749
compatible with the current bike

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,789
controller designers on the market but

00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:35,399
it also is compatible future designs

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:37,919
that are coming later on with better

00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,060
from huge different designs or other

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,980
innovations that we will see

00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:44,010
industry just happening naturally by

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:49,230
like other companies growing into the

00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:51,570
markets by direction okay that sounds

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:58,050
pretty important for for this industry

00:25:51,570 --> 00:26:00,150
to scale good so how if if if I want to

00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:02,250
use that flight controller because I

00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:05,430
want to create my own base board or I

00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:10,230
want to maybe create my own flight

00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:12,210
controller how do I engage so there is

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,810
like Pixar talk as the central point of

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,190
reference

00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:15,930
I'm very published also the

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,030
documentation for all these standards

00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,000
and you can find the latest releases

00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:23,100
that are already finished or complete

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,440
then there is a five if you call a rich

00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,210
like a Tuesday where you can engage with

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,630
the community that we discussed there is

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,550
profit on this all odd if I can't

00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,710
believe I'm like actually is an actual

00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,540
or the other generations that belong to

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,760
it we discussed it weeks ago the pilot

00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,490
death there but then there are also

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:43,140
other standards like Pixar failure class

00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:45,690
or the Pixar smart battery that were

00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:47,400
also part of those discussions so please

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,840
join there and provide your feedback so

00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,040
you can have an influence on what we'd

00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,950
actually standardize on how that

00:26:50,040 --> 00:27:01,050
interface will look like in the end very

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:03,660
good so okay I think I think we've we've

00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:06,540
covered a lot of ground so those were I

00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:09,260
think my main questions now I would

00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:13,800
really love to turn to the audience and

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:18,150
see what questions are coming up so I

00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:19,950
believe that there is one or rather two

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,180
topics that I quickly would like to

00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:25,890
cover that we haven't touched so one is

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:28,170
we haven't really specifically talked

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:32,160
about it but part of the Pixar standard

00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:34,440
series is also a payload bus and that is

00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:38,340
defining the interface to a gimbal or

00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:41,240
camera or both and it's using Mavs link

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:45,960
for communication it has Ethernet it has

00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,760
USB and it's something that you should

00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,510
also check out if you're interested in

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,430
the standards

00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,770
we're not the

00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:53,470
getting it to full depth today because

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,900
we have different people on the panel

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,360
but it's something that is also well

00:27:56,900 --> 00:28:01,310
specified and where you will find drafts

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,190
and where there is a biweekly discussion

00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:05,990
in the working group now the other topic

00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:08,360
that was already asked in the audience

00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:13,360
and please write more questions into the

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:16,640
chat was unmanned traffic management UTM

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,960
integration and what are we doing there

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,030
so two things number one there are a

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,310
number of standardization efforts and

00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:29,900
bodies already in the space there is

00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:34,420
also a inter unmanned system traffic

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:37,610
management open source project into USS

00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:40,640
part of the Linux Foundation you can

00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:44,960
check that out and we're implementing

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,480
that of course as a community that's

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:51,290
focused around the flight controller

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:53,840
kernel we are not necessarily driving

00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:55,850
our own airspace standards so we're

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,880
we're working with the existing bodies

00:28:55,850 --> 00:29:01,820
were really close there we did an

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,190
integration with air map with px 4 and Q

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:08,750
ground control about two or three years

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:12,410
ago you can I'm pure find the

00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:15,020
announcement online this is something

00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:18,260
that you can also explore and of course

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,800
we're more than happy to welcome other

00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:24,550
UTM providers with an integration with

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:27,650
key ground control in our community so

00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:29,090
very active there we're not driving it

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,720
ourselves though because there are

00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:35,260
already great efforts underway so let's

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:40,850
see what came on came in in terms of

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:44,740
questions so one question is how does

00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:47,380
Pixar roadmap to compare to Sky node so

00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:50,210
it's really important to tell us apart

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,790
sky node is a product of a company so

00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:55,250
from px4 perspective and you know it's

00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:58,040
just one of the products that is using

00:29:55,250 --> 00:30:00,680
the standard in terms of standardization

00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,730
we're looking at all the different

00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:06,120
stakeholders all the different kind

00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:08,549
use that participate so there's there's

00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,660
modal AI they're companies like holy

00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:14,250
Bros you the there are other vendors who

00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,380
might not have engaged yet in the

00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:20,190
standardization effort but who are super

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,960
welcome to their end users like free fly

00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:25,020
for example that are using these

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:29,850
standards or quantum systems or others

00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:32,160
and the goal of the autopilot standard

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:35,010
is to create a common base in terms of

00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:37,169
mechanical and electrical interfaces for

00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:39,480
these different parts and companies to

00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:45,030
work together and then individual

00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:47,520
products use it and are compliant and so

00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,970
you know that when a product uses the

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,470
standard that you get certain levels of

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:54,690
interoperability the same way as you

00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:57,059
know that if a product supports Wi-Fi or

00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,010
Bluetooth or USB that certain things

00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:03,650
will work and that's exactly the goal

00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:06,650
here let me see if there are more

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,650
questions

00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:14,700
payload bus for RGB cameras only no the

00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:18,559
payload bus is super general-purpose you

00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:23,070
can connect a lidar you can connect

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,440
thermal cameras anything by default we

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:30,570
have a pretty worked well worked out set

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:34,070
off camera standards including four IR

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:40,620
cameras but that's being continuously

00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:44,070
expanded so it's not limited to it let's

00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:47,690
see more questions 200 people there no

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:47,690
questions on standards

00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:58,570
any thoughts on working with parachute

00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:01,630
recovery system companies yes absolutely

00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:06,220
I mean by all means we're looking very

00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:09,910
heavily now in architecting software

00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:12,760
hardware for safety and that's part of

00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:15,160
the standardization effort so parachutes

00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:18,670
are of course an important part of that

00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:24,730
solution and so we're more than happy to

00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:26,220
collaborate on that Hey Lorentz promote

00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:29,200
here I have a question from the audience

00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:30,940
yes why reinvent the wheel with

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,620
standards when the industry got plenty

00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:39,550
of standards were already avionics IOT

00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:41,710
why not just pick one that's a good

00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:44,950
question because everybody is trying you

00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:46,720
know the old story is you have 13

00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,120
standards then you try to do one

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:52,330
standard to unite them all and then

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,340
after that you have 14 standards we're

00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,890
very well aware but what you need to

00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,370
know is that we've done this pixhawk

00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:03,760
standardization in the beginning since

00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:07,180
2008 but really where the whole drone

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,590
industry adopted it around 2013 which

00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:15,100
picks off one and so that is a

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:17,230
well-established thing Google Pixar see

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,730
how many different models are out there

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,830
they're all using the same system

00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:23,800
architecture they're all more or less

00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:26,500
software compatible and that has already

00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:29,380
set a standard in this industry that a

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:34,000
lot of people are implicitly relying on

00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:37,690
the same way as the IBM PC set standards

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,820
like the ice ax or PCI bus for the PC

00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:42,820
industry and so we're already there

00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:46,390
we've already done it and we've done it

00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:51,240
because all the aviation standards that

00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:54,990
are out there they are targeting pretty

00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:59,770
hot I wouldn't say high-end I would say

00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:02,110
large very regulated systems and it

00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,710
starts with things like that every of

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:06,770
the standard document

00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:09,139
copies is like $500 so if you're a

00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:11,089
smaller drone company and you want to

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:14,919
implement I don't know an aviation

00:34:11,089 --> 00:34:18,080
system you end up easily spending

00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:21,109
$20,000 on PDFs and so that's a

00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,460
non-starter already so our standards are

00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:26,659
not just standard they're also open

00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:29,210
they're free you can just download them

00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:32,060
that's one big topic and then the other

00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:34,399
topic is their compact they're easy to

00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:36,859
implement they're small and again we're

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:39,260
not starting out of nowhere we're taking

00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:39,740
all the legacy all the history of

00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,070
pixhawk

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:48,290
and we're just formalizing what

00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:49,490
everybody is using already great Thank

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:51,020
You Lauren so I'm gonna give you one

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:52,399
last question and then I need to let you

00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:54,679
know because they have another speaker

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,990
queued up our last question is is there

00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:01,130
going to be a specific organization to

00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:05,630
take care of the standards so the

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:08,960
specific they're all the standards are

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:12,770
all part of the picsArt working group

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,530
that is a project of the drone code

00:35:12,770 --> 00:35:18,560
foundation so part of what we're

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:21,560
presenting here part of this dev summit

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,490
and so we do already have a nonprofit

00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:27,880
organization that is already very

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,710
familiar with standardization efforts is

00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:34,190
backed by the Linux Foundation so we

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:37,280
have also the professional structure

00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:40,220
around it and yeah that's that's how

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:43,900
we're driving it excellent thank you

00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:43,900
guys thank you for your time

00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,200
hey folks welcome back to the picks for

00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:50,270
developer summit lateral uses are gone

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,950
this was just the panel Thank You

00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,720
panelists this was really awesome I want

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,670
to thank them for their time and their

00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,290
awesome contributions they're making to

00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:58,070
the open source community dick-suck

00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,930
standards

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,210
check out the website we just linked it

00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:05,349
on the chat room on slack and also on

00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,349
