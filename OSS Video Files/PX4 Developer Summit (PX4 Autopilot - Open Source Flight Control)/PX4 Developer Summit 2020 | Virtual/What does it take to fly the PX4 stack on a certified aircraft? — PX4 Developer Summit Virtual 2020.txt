hey everyone my name is Gokul I am the

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:14,910
director of technology for robots expert

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:18,660
today I would like to talk about what

00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,560
does it take to fly the px4 stack on a

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:26,330
certified aircraft specifically we will

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,550
be going into details about the do-178c

00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:32,550
certification and what's involved in the

00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:36,300
process and how do we go about getting

00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,969
the certification has a short

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,079
introduction robots expert this is the

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:45,890
company I work for is a Finnish company

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,350
and we've been involved in several

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,570
national and international projects one

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,180
of them worth mentioning is the 5g

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,370
drones project which is a current

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,800
project actually funded by the European

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:04,019
Commission under the horizon 2020 scheme

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:08,570
and we have about 21 partners spread

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:11,010
across the European Union and we have

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,500
done a few things in the past for

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:18,869
example we were the first company to be

00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:21,240
a part of the project which did the

00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:24,090
air-taxi flight which was the Bullock of

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,890
Korea aircraft I flew in Helsinki

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:31,799
Airport and beber a party us-based

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,689
project the Gulf of Finland and it was

00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,570
the first international drone Logistics

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,490
flight between Estonia and Finland so

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:42,509
that was another accomplishment flying

00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,000
across the Baltic Sea and also we were

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,960
the first company to perform

00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,360
drone logistics flight in less than one

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,500
kilometer from an active airport which

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,270
was the helsinki-vantaa Airport and we

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,210
will also the first one to perform BB

00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,180
loss flights in Finland for an aircraft

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,000
weighing more than hundred kilos and

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,970
ultimately be contributed to the Gulf of

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,520
Finland new space project specifically

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,870
the architecture which is now being used

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,900
as the reference architecture in the

00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:19,569
Union having said that I would like to

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,370
move on and talk about who could be my

00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:22,720
target audience for today and then who

00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:28,540
can really benefit from this

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:33,250
presentation now we have OEMs companies

00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:36,129
that manufacture drones and they have

00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,430
Hardware suppliers now here when I say

00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:42,390
how they're I'm referring to just the

00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:45,400
bare metal so in this case composites

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,239
could be the servos and propellers and

00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,590
the different fuselage for the aircraft

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,730
then you have the flight controller

00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:57,340
hardware in this case the pixhawk it

00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,530
could also be your d TI 83 or n3 v

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,680
controller it doesn't matter and then

00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:05,410
you have the software that runs or

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:08,769
controls the flight controller so in

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,420
this case it's the px4 and autopilot i

00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:14,319
think in all fairness I'm going to be

00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:16,720
focusing on the px4 flight stack so now

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,989
these three together would form the

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,980
system level components that's essential

00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:26,170
to have an aircraft successfully fly now

00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:29,139
outside of this you also have external

00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,780
software supplier for example many

00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:35,440
people write AI software on on immediate

00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:38,349
chipsets that would be mounted on the

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,900
aircraft it is not a part of the flight

00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:44,950
controller but it's something besides

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,900
the flight controller now there could be

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,630
an arrangement there the external

00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:52,419
software supplier is collaborating with

00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,139
the company that's making pixhawk or

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:58,030
manufacturing pick silk or it could be

00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,889
that the external software supplier is

00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,709
collaborating with the OEM itself

00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:07,359
correctly we have some examples of that

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:10,510
for example unique as a company you have

00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:15,160
hotel you have impossible airspace many

00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:17,169
different companies now if we leave all

00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,459
these things aside you have EAB operator

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:23,860
now this may not be an entity that's

00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,500
involved with the manufacturing process

00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,740
per se they're they're more involved in

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:31,940
the field work

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,340
and then finally you have the end user

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,009
I'm gonna move this a little bit so it

00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,620
doesn't block the view perfect

00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:43,520
you had the end user now the end user

00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:46,340
male pain a drone which is fully

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,220
assembled ready to fly from the operator

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:51,530
they may not own their own they may be

00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,560
just leasing it or they may just be

00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,810
using it for an hour or two or the

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,240
inducer might procure the drone directly

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,440
from the OEM so there's several type of

00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:06,160
types of arrangement

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:11,419
now the do-178c is directly applicable

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:15,020
for this group which is writing the form

00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,360
there or the software or the piece of

00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,990
code that controls the flight controller

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,740
and everything related to that all right

00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,750
now if you belong to this crew meaning

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,139
if you're someone that's writing code

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:34,190
for pixhawk or the pilot or the px4 form

00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:36,440
there or if you work for an OEM or AP or

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:38,720
an OEM and you're building all these

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,660
things in the house or if you're an

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,270
integrator you don't build but you

00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:47,320
actually assemble things in your in your

00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:50,960
company this presentation could be

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:55,159
useful for you but that being said I

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:59,659
would like him on this a bee a bee is a

00:05:55,159 --> 00:06:04,070
Dutch Evie tall manufacturer I've known

00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:06,889
them for a few years now and they've

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,199
been pioneering pioneering in the drone

00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:12,050
industry they were part of the sapphire

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,199
project which was which was a us-based

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:18,949
project and they performed flight in

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,570
urban conditions and they've been doing

00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,949
some really good work related to medical

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:24,440
deliveries and such things you should

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:27,409
check them out but what I like about

00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:30,500
them is their safety framework combining

00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:35,750
FMEA and sort of framework they have put

00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:37,849
together a robust safety by design set

00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:41,280
up and and then it's really interesting

00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:44,270
now instead of me talking I'm just

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,580
loading the words from the foundry here

00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:50,130
this is done by designing a system for

00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,680
specific mission by calculating

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:54,780
potential likelihood and impact to

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,480
identify potential risk and then

00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:02,960
mitigating that mitigating that risk by

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:06,120
enhancing the design now a V was able to

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,790
design their aircraft in such a way that

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,860
it is currently the only aircraft in the

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:13,169
Netherlands that is approved to

00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,690
regularly fly BV last missions now

00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,010
that's a big deal if you are involved in

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:20,100
the drone industry and if you are trying

00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:23,430
to fly be with us either in the US or in

00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,840
the European continent you know that

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,050
it's a big deal to fly by Balazs

00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,050
missions and to be able to fly regularly

00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:37,890
it you have to prove a lot of safety

00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:40,500
critical aspects do the yes are and then

00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:42,930
other related authorities and then I

00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,479
think hats off to what AV has done so

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,960
far and I am NOT surprised that they won

00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,540
the safety award in the most recent lake

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,190
Kibo challenge now I'm quoting them as

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:58,350
an example to show that safety is

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,810
perhaps one of the most important things

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,090
when it comes to aerospace engineering

00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:05,039
especially flight design and then and

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,770
then software related to flight

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,039
controller now but that being said I'd

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:15,660
like to move on directly to the subject

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:19,470
do-178c an arp four seven six six one a

00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:21,600
now that's a lot of acronyms a lot of

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:24,350
numbers to digest so let's start with

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,870
the basic things you have an ecosystem

00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:29,900
ARP four seven six one a it's a safety

00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:33,900
assessment it stands for aerospace

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,390
recommended practice now remember I will

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,280
notice the keyboard here it's

00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:41,580
recommended practice right it's it's not

00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:44,940
mandate its it's not a rule it's

00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,430
recommended now through the safety

00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,709
assessment you would come up with your

00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:52,080
initial architectures and criticality

00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:55,150
levels like how you how you would

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:59,680
perform solo for example and

00:08:55,150 --> 00:09:06,250
you would couple that with ARP 475 for

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:09,850
alpha now 475 4 is different from 476 1

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:15,150
in this instead 476 one focuses on

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:17,050
safety assessment but 475 for the 54 is

00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:19,630
specifically used for system development

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,940
now and it comes to system development

00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:26,020
you would split it into two one is the

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,370
do-178c which is for a software and the

00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:30,460
other one is do-254

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,650
which is for hard work now today's

00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:37,030
presentation they're going to focus on

00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:39,760
the software part now in all fairness

00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:43,720
it's going to be impossible to name this

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:47,110
topic in just 15 minutes talking about

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:52,390
Bo and 7/8 C could take anywhere from an

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:54,700
entire day to roughly a month but let's

00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:57,940
try our best to grasp as much as we can

00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:02,250
and my intention is to have this

00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:04,600
presentation act as an eye-opener and

00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,730
then talk about some of the critical

00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:11,920
aspects involved in in proceeding with

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,400
do-178c and there's a lot of myth behind

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,890
this in and I would like to you know

00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:21,310
debunk some of those now having said

00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:24,100
that do 1 7 8 is the worst standard in

00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,670
the world except for all the others

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:31,390
right this is a direct quote from one of

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,700
the one of the experts who was one of

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,740
the contributors to do one seven eight

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:38,410
it's been around for decades it's

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:42,010
nothing new but some of the rules have

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:45,580
changed recently due to adapt to

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,410
unmanned systems now has we move along

00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:51,670
you will find a lot of terminologies

00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:53,830
which says passengers and now we want to

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,990
try and refine those two more unmanned

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,240
we don't have to work hard the hard work

00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:01,690
has been done we just have to go along

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,080
with it right now why do we want to do

00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,430
this

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,730
the FAA and yassir are considering

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,740
do-178c

00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:14,959
and

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:17,660
4750 for more closer than ever in degree

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,120
in the last four or five years they've

00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:22,700
been accepting these frameworks and then

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,250
standards more more and more and

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,420
especially they are starting to support

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,640
model-based design and then several

00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,959
other concepts so we're going to look at

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,240
the some of those today now we see the

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,230
first terminology here already be ale

00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:43,610
it stands for design assurance level now

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:47,630
you have levels a through E where a is

00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,410
catastrophic and he is no safety effect

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,160
at all

00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:56,230
which means that if something were to go

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,980
wrong in the software and it leads to

00:11:56,230 --> 00:12:02,660
you know failure of the aircraft system

00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,490
would the crash of the aircraft lead to

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,580
something catastrophic or would it lead

00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,399
to no safety effect at all that's kind

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,770
of like what we're looking at now one of

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,649
the columns is two objectives you can

00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:18,940
see that for safety level a which is

00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:22,100
catastrophic you have to meet 71

00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:26,420
objectives now these objectives are like

00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:29,089
let's say checklists or prerequisites

00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:33,230
that the software has to pass in order

00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:35,480
to qualify for level a level e you don't

00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:38,270
have to bother much now what's

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,630
interesting is the independence part on

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:46,940
the rightmost column the independence

00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:49,390
states that all of 71 30 of those

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:52,070
checklists or prerequisites

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:56,240
prerequisites I'm sorry or conditions

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:58,970
must be independent meaning the person

00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,029
who authored the code or wrote that

00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,610
piece of code cannot be the same as the

00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:06,430
person doing the testing validation and

00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:08,870
verification it must be done by

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:12,050
different individuals now what's

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,360
interesting to notice here is that from

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,870
level a to e they can see varying

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:21,350
numbers of independent requirements and

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:23,690
in the scale of the increase in

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,120
in those levels it's pretty drastic here

00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:28,820
so let's let's go through the different

00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,950
levels and then kind of like establish

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,250
the basics catastrophic

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:38,360
well failure may cause fatalities and

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:41,990
lots of airplane the most recent one is

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,360
the Boeing 737 max we all know about the

00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,760
issue related a.m. Cass and then there's

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,110
still a lot of study going on so so we

00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,530
don't want to comment on such things but

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:54,580
hazardous hazardous might leave a large

00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:58,400
negative impact on safety or performance

00:13:54,580 --> 00:14:02,540
it may lead to physical distress or

00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:05,300
fatal injuries among passengers now in

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:08,540
case of drones there's not going to be

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,850
passengers but it might lead to some

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:16,030
damage at ground level when they don't

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:18,980
cassia's now major as the word says

00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:22,700
significant increase in the damage

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:25,010
that's what we're looking at minor as

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,070
the name says it's minor effects it

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:29,780
might for example cause injury to

00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:33,740
someone but it's not going to be

00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:37,360
anything critical or fatal and no effect

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,650
at all it's pretty straightforward now

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,130
this is the most important part the

00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:45,410
process how does this work we start with

00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:48,590
a simple safety assessment and

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:50,680
requirements we want us to be robust we

00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:54,380
want this to be as clear as possible

00:14:50,680 --> 00:15:00,290
once we have that we want to establish a

00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:02,600
QA Quality Assurance and once the QA is

00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:06,320
set in place you start defining the

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,640
system requirements and the system

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,280
requirements would leave you

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,810
automatically to development plants

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:17,110
standards and checklists and once you

00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:19,940
have the checklists and and and

00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,560
standards in the plants you would start

00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,360
writing your traceability now

00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:28,130
traceability is critical here

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,710
India one seven eight it's given a lot

00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:33,380
of importance for example you would have

00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,570
to create RPMs requirement traceability

00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:38,240
matrix that's just

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:41,600
one example now once you have the

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,790
traceability or the traceability systems

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,960
you would go into configuration

00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:50,300
management systems now after this point

00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,170
you'll be very for the first stage of

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:57,350
involvement which would be SOS are

00:15:54,170 --> 00:16:01,630
basically stages where you would have

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:05,150
your first official review or audit by

00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:08,750
ESO or FAA or the authority that that

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,940
will be referring to once you complete

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,260
your first SOI

00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,470
you'll go into defining the high-level

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,270
requirements now at this stage we are

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,460
not talking about code we're not talking

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,970
about logic or flowcharts or anything

00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,620
this is high level requirements and from

00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:29,780
there they would move on to low level

00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:31,490
requirements pretty obvious now once you

00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:33,970
have the low level requirements you

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:36,320
would start going into design principles

00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:38,570
storyboarding things and flowchart such

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,670
things now what's important and notice

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:46,220
here is that the requirements here

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,980
actually have a connection to the system

00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:52,730
requirements that we wrote in the

00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,740
previous stage and there the system

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,310
requirements you would split it into

00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:01,760
software and hardware which is do-178c

00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:04,280
which deals with software and Bo 2 5 4

00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,410
which deals with hardware I'm not

00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,820
touching on the hardware part here at

00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:10,280
this point because we are discussing

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:11,839
only the software but just wanted to

00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:14,240
mention that all these things are

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,720
combined it's an iterative process in

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,540
and none of these things can or should

00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,150
happen in silo you know everything has

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:25,579
to go hand-in-hand otherwise you're

00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,670
going to have a software that literally

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:31,100
has nothing to do with the order so

00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,810
let's go back design so once you have

00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,380
the design you would start going into

00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:39,410
code and logic now this is your initial

00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:41,360
code source code and logic and once you

00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:44,390
finish that you will be ready for your

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:48,100
second stage of involvement or the

00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:51,330
review and this is critical once you

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,410
a second SOI you would go in immigration

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:54,550
he would start integrating with

00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,650
different things you might have

00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,810
different pieces of code you want to

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:01,210
start putting them together

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:01,930
now remember none of these things are

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,780
happening

00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:07,840
on and so on all of these things are

00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,880
happening in a loop in a way that I will

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:13,690
show that on the side and then in a

00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:16,510
short notice but these things are

00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,400
connected to each other by a loop called

00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:20,950
the verification and validation system

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,730
and I'm they're going to look at that in

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,800
detail but once you finish the

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:30,510
integration you would go into conformity

00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:33,790
review now this is crucial because

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,150
that's when you get the third state of

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:39,490
involvement from the verification and

00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,740
validation system remember I was saying

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:45,130
all of these things are interconnected

00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:46,630
and we're all in the loop so the high

00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,390
level requirements would feed to the

00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,100
verification and validation and the low

00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,470
level requirements would also freedom to

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:55,990
the verification and validation and it's

00:18:53,470 --> 00:19:00,400
in a way that at each and every stage

00:18:55,990 --> 00:19:02,500
you're actually looking at verifying and

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,900
validating the results from each stage

00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:07,390
and it's it's a fairly iterative process

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:10,780
and there's the same for design and then

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:13,330
code and everything so once that

00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,210
iterative process is complete you would

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,330
go into third stage of enrollment like

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,190
how the same and the results of that if

00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:24,400
you pass you were going to conformity

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:26,560
review and that takes you to the fourth

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,010
stage of involvement remember there's

00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:32,710
four stages of involvement here so this

00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:36,340
is gonna be good because you have four

00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:39,190
opportunities to have the authorities

00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:41,770
audit your process order to your system

00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:43,240
that way you don't wait until the end of

00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,270
the process and then figure out that

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,030
something is wrong you get feedback at

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:53,350
each and every stage so that's one of

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,450
the biggest advantages here so if you

00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:58,380
pass the fourth state of involvement

00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,540
you're ready for flight test because

00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,780
that's actually your certification

00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,170
now there's a lot of things involved in

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:10,750
these different stages and then there's

00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:14,410
different matrices involved different

00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:17,740
calculations obviously it's not within

00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:19,090
the scope of this presentation as much

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,270
as I would love to go into the details

00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:27,850
of these boxes and then can I explore

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:32,560
them further I'm gonna say that this is

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:34,600
one way of going about the do-178c

00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,470
process there's there can be many

00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,590
different ways

00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:42,070
now what's critical is that depending on

00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:45,040
the method that you use the cost for the

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,530
process would vary I'm not saying this

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,780
is the best process I'm saying that this

00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:51,670
is one of the methods that's been proven

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:56,470
in the industry over the last several

00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:59,080
years so you can you if you pay sheep

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:02,500
you can you can start using this right a

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:06,970
big now what's important to notice here

00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:10,120
is how long have to move this again all

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,130
right on the top you see the blue boxes

00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,260
they are all in the planning phase

00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:16,510
that's why I was saying in that phase

00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:19,860
you don't write a single line of code

00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:22,690
you don't touch your C++ compiler at all

00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:25,300
now in the bottom you have the green

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:28,630
boxes that's the development and

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,800
correction trees they there you will be

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,960
handso on your your team is actively

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,660
working on a daily basis to fix some of

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:42,160
the errors or bugs that you might come

00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:45,790
across so but this is a cyclic process

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,800
this is an iterative process and this if

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:49,930
we were to visualize this in a more

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,360
appropriate way instead of these clumsy

00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:55,000
boxes it would look something like this

00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:57,520
it's a standard beam model for software

00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,820
development life cycle except in this

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,620
case we broke it down even further so

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:05,500
you start from the top left your

00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,810
planning process so once the planning is

00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:09,760
done you go into requirements and you

00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:12,800
start passing things around from one

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,990
stage to another but at the same time

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,910
your your stages are being verified and

00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:22,130
validated so you can see that there is a

00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:25,130
separate development process and there

00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:26,480
is a verification process and all of

00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,720
this is handled by the software

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,160
configuration management process and

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,740
this comes under the umbrella of

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:37,730
software Quality Assurance process now

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:42,590
all of this remember is only for

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:45,350
software do-178c does not deal with you

00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:48,640
know how well your EEOC's perform or how

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:52,180
good your GPS is no this is only

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,430
software for the flight controller

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:58,340
especially the essential and critical

00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:02,240
components that we are talking about now

00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:06,800
if you were to integrate the do-178c B

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,810
model with the do-254 B model this is

00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:12,740
what it would look like so you start

00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:14,360
from the left top start defining the

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,810
aircraft requirements you start

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:21,830
identifying then from there you would go

00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:25,130
into system requirements so and then you

00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:27,320
break the system down into items so once

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,870
you've identified and defined the

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,410
requirements for the items you would

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:35,380
start designing well once you start

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,600
designing them he would start very fine

00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,970
so once the items are verified you would

00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:43,880
go into system verification and finally

00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:46,100
aircraft verification now this would

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,870
sound a lot like unit testing

00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,740
integration testing smoke testing blah

00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:54,200
blah blah VP software engineers know

00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,840
what I'm talking about but for the ones

00:23:54,200 --> 00:24:01,640
that are not software engineers this is

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:06,530
a typical B model combining hardware and

00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:09,170
software development so if you want to

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:11,600
build an aircraft you should start with

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:14,810
both the hardware and the software and

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,540
take the constraints requirements and

00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:20,500
put it through a design process put it

00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:26,429
through a beam on something like the

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:29,129
47:54 here this would ideally if

00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:32,039
everything goes as per the plan this

00:24:29,129 --> 00:24:37,230
would ideally lead you to a robust

00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:42,749
system that's safe and also with high

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:46,200
quality so that takes us to who's using

00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:48,990
these systems today I mean these are not

00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:52,499
common these are expensive processes

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:57,059
sended time consuming so expense in

00:24:52,499 --> 00:25:00,480
terms of resource and time and money so

00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:03,240
who is using these processes and why are

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,929
they using it well we know some familiar

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,919
players micro pilot the last article

00:25:06,929 --> 00:25:17,399
that I read they were going to achieve

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:18,659
do-178c certification by q2 2020 so so

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:22,259
we need to go back and check on the

00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:24,749
status General Atomics they are the

00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:26,759
creators of the predator drone and some

00:25:24,749 --> 00:25:31,200
of the other drones that we may have

00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:33,360
heard of Ekstrom again they are one of

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,169
the largest suppliers of unmanned

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,600
vehicles for the United States military

00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:42,600
Lockheed Martin no need of introduction

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,279
for them now these are not only for

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:48,499
military applications these can also be

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,480
used for commercial applications

00:25:48,499 --> 00:25:54,240
especially larger fleet operations I'm

00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:55,710
not talking about pilot projects I'm not

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,990
talking about research and innovation

00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:00,119
projects I'm talking about commercial

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,580
projects where the market is established

00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:04,470
already so if you are a company doing

00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,720
drone delivery and and you want to go

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,759
fully commercial you've identified your

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,679
business models you've identified your

00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,230
infrastructure ecosystem everything you

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,700
have a customer waiting for you if the

00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:16,980
only thing pending is the regulatory

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:20,720
aspects I would say start preparing for

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:23,580
video one seven eight it's high time now

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,960
why do we want to do it well it's an

00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:26,639
expensive process we already talked

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,149
about it and it's going to take let's

00:26:26,639 --> 00:26:34,379
say on an average two to three years to

00:26:30,149 --> 00:26:36,840
obtain MTU 178 C certification then on

00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:39,840
top of the O and 7/8 C you have po2 five

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,970
for the other certification

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,409
you would have to worry about depending

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:48,179
on whether you're an OEM meaning if

00:26:46,409 --> 00:26:52,909
you're building the entire drone

00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:59,400
in-house or if you are someone like

00:26:52,909 --> 00:27:02,309
Damien for example or if you are someone

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,240
like AV where you manufacture the drone

00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:06,650
but in the pixhawk

00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:11,640
is coming from another reputed company

00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:14,640
so the responsibilities would differ so

00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:19,200
what I would say is perform a gap

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:23,220
analysis now what does that mean the

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,669
myth is that b-17 made C sorry they own

00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,390
7/8 in general you shouldn't have to

00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:29,190
start over

00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:32,669
you shouldn't have to start from the

00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:35,669
beginning most of the companies and most

00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:38,610
of the developers have these processes

00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:43,020
in place already right now

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:46,049
the gap analysis in do-178c would

00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:49,950
identify how much of what you've already

00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:51,690
done in terms of you know software

00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:54,000
development lifecycle management and

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,080
configuration management documentation

00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,179
how much of that can be utilized towards

00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:03,419
one seven eight C certification and then

00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:05,789
how much more spending now now that gap

00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,100
analysis is critical because it would

00:28:05,789 --> 00:28:09,899
actually give you a good idea of how

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,880
much time it's going to take for you and

00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:14,070
how many people you'll need in the team

00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:18,390
and how much money you will need all of

00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:20,940
these things will directly affect or

00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:24,090
impact your your business model and such

00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:28,919
things so please do have a look at the

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:31,350
gap analysis for do-178c now the most

00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:33,600
important thing is we want to try and

00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:37,230
minimize human involvement as much as

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,990
possible so you could use automated

00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:44,490
project management and review tools for

00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:47,850
example matlab already offers really

00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,679
advanced and effective model-based

00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:52,239
design tools

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,759
you can actually do end-to-end testing

00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:58,299
and automation and QA and all of those

00:28:54,759 --> 00:29:01,539
can be done within within the tool

00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:04,450
what's important is this poll do and 7hc

00:29:01,539 --> 00:29:06,190
say agnostic to the court meaning the

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,529
programming language you could be

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:12,119
writing your code in Python or C++ or C

00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:18,399
or who cares Java it shouldn't matter

00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:23,259
what does matter is the software line of

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:27,549
code sock loc so the number of lines of

00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:30,159
code has a strong correlation to the

00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:33,579
team that's required to do this

00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:35,379
certification and the cost and the time

00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:37,209
it's going to take to obtain this

00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:38,919
certification so that's something you

00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:42,070
might want to watch out for but of

00:29:38,919 --> 00:29:45,399
course automating these things would be

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:49,719
a lot more cheaper and finally if you

00:29:45,399 --> 00:29:53,289
have the do-178c and maybe some of the

00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:55,089
other certifications by the end of it

00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:59,489
you actually have any other space create

00:29:55,089 --> 00:30:04,719
product so which is now certified

00:29:59,489 --> 00:30:07,690
validated and verified now this could

00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:09,339
open up different doors for you

00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,519
depending on the type of market you're

00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:15,039
targeting it could be in the oil and gas

00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:16,419
industry could be some project with NATO

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:19,509
it could be some project with other

00:30:16,419 --> 00:30:21,969
difference organizations so things are

00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:26,969
changing so it's always better to be

00:30:21,969 --> 00:30:30,459
prepared with a product that has the

00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:34,179
quality in the industry and going there

00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:36,429
with a roughly designed product that's

00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:39,099
that's not up to the mark

00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:41,109
but you believe it is then when you put

00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:43,809
it to test the customer reports that

00:30:41,109 --> 00:30:47,320
something failed some of the things I

00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:49,379
could point out me and my team we used

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:54,419
to do a lot of testing with px for

00:30:49,379 --> 00:30:58,079
different releases of px for I think the

00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:01,569
the team of developers they have done

00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:02,380
incredible work and then hats off to

00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,289
them for

00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:08,070
for putting in their time and effort in

00:31:05,289 --> 00:31:10,480
not only developing the code but also

00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:13,299
you know in taking the time to review

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:17,730
the issues and and correct some of the

00:31:13,299 --> 00:31:21,820
errors fix the bugs that takes a lot but

00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:24,880
but you can't go to market but that kind

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,270
of system where you are testing a

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,299
product on the fly and that's not a good

00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:34,539
idea if you want to go commercial now if

00:31:31,299 --> 00:31:36,580
you're a research organization fine but

00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:39,669
if you want to go commercial you want to

00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:41,799
start using drones for spraying not just

00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:44,320
one don4t drones at the same time or you

00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:45,909
want to do it on deliveries or you want

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,880
to use drones for survey so whatever

00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:51,159
application the last thing you want to

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,100
see is that the drone is crashing

00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:59,710
because of a bug that was left unnoticed

00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:04,210
or unidentified so we have seen some

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:06,309
cases of drones crashing in public I

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:10,870
don't want to mention any names here it

00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:13,659
happened quite a few times and that in a

00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:17,070
way halted the production and in

00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:22,570
progress for the other companies so

00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:25,510
adapting to a more standardized way of

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:28,960
developing software would lead to a more

00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:33,780
productive and better quality in the

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,429
product so that's that's just fact now

00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:39,490
with all of these things what I want to

00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:40,990
say is that flight safety is simple the

00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,330
number of successful landing should be

00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,669
equal to the number of takeoffs it's

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:48,909
straightforward I don't know who the

00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:53,110
author was I I found it online and I've

00:32:48,909 --> 00:32:55,840
always admired this quote and I I it

00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:58,960
helps me stay grounded in and kind of

00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:02,280
like look at safety as a first and

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,590
foremost priority while designing things

00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:09,190
but that being said I want to say thank

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:11,500
you to all of you on behalf of me and my

00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:12,010
team from robot 6-foot thank you
