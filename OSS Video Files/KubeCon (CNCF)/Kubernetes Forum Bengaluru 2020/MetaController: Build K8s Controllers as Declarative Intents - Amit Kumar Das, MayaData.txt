MetaController: Build K8s Controllers as Declarative Intents - Amit Kumar Das, MayaData

In the world of Kubernetes (K8s) it is natural to have heard about controllers. Controllers are a natural extension to K8s that help in building domain specific infrastructure logic. In case you have written any controller logic, you would have noticed a lot of learning curve to implement the same. There has been various attempts to provide scaffolding and code patterns to ease this development. While these guidelines have tried to provide nice abstractions, they fail to groove us into the reconciliation mindset which acts as a steep barrier to enter into Kubernetes paradigm. In this talk, Amit will showcase how MetaController (https://metacontroller.app/) help teams to think and design controllers with reconciliation as the first class citizen. They will also demo how K8s specific details are pushed to the background enabling teams to innovate on their lines of business.
