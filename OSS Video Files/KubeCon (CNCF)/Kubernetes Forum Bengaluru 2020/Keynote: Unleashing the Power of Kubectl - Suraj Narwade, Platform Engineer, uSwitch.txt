Keynote: Unleashing the Power of Kubectl - Suraj Narwade, Platform Engineer, uSwitch 

Do you use kubectl? How efficiently do you use kubernetes? In this talk, I will give you a tour of some of the most powerful, interesting and less-known features of kubernetes command line i.e kubectl. While preparing for CKA(Certified Kubernetes Administrator), I found some of the commands very interesting and worth sharing with a wider audience. These tricks will help the audience to learn new things about kubectl which will improve their productivity with kubectl. The talk will involve things like how you can set editor of your choice for kubectl, how to know about kubernetes resources using kubectl only and a lot more cool stuff. We will also discuss extending kubectl using plugins and an awesome new tool.
