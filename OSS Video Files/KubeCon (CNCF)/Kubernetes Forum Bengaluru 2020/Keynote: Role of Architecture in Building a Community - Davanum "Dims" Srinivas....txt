Keynote: Role of Architecture in Building a Community - Davanum "Dims" Srinivas, Chairperson of Kubernetes Forum Bengaluru & Staff Engineer II, VMware

Kubernetes is being hailed as the next big thing for managing cloud-native environments. What is it about Kubernetes that has triggered large scale adoption? Is it the architecture? Is it the community? How do they affect each other? In this talk, we will explore some of the basic concepts quickly and try to understand where we are and how we got here. We will go over some of the landmarks in the timeline and how decisions were made to shape the project and community to where it is today.
