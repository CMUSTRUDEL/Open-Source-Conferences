                              value that community brings and how can                                you become the part of this community                                and how can you bring yo well

you can remember                                that CN CF has a few dozen open source                                projects and all of them are developed                                by people they are all developed in the                                open way and in the open source way all                                these projects have the solid                                contributors community and the soul and                                users community around them and all                                these projects again they are all built                                by us by the representatives of the                                community so the first thing that here                                should be wearable if you are                                considering becoming a contributor to                                the cloud native ecosystem is to check                                out our contributing contributors guides                                on that are hosted on github they are                                available to everyone and they share the                                insights and how can you become a code                                developer for some of the ciencia                                projects how can you start your local                                meetup group for example how can you be                                more successful in some different errors                                of the community building and what are                                other available things that you can do                                for this code a typical system                                one of the easiest way to get started                                with the cloud Native community is to                                join one of our meetup groups today we                                have more than                                                        the globe and

                    the kubernetes community i'm going to do                                a very shameless plug here I gave a                                lengthier version of the stock in the                                 previous last year's kubernetes raise                                 India so if this is something you're                                 interested in also go watch that talk so                                 the upstream communities project is                                 divided into multiple groups the most                                 common one that you might have heard in                                 this whole conference is special                                 interest groups or six six other groups                                 which own code and and you might have                                 heard of cigs like saccade six CLI or                                 six testing which focus on certain                                 aspects of the project there are also                                 groups called working groups which are                                 temporary groups for crossing efforts                                 there are user groups which have a focus                                 towards users of kubernetes and there                                 are committees which deal with sensitive                                 items in the project so as you can see                                 we have a ton of these groups and you                                 can join and participate in the ones                                 that you're interested in all of these                                 groups have mailing lists and slack                                 channels where you can join interact and                                 ask questions to maintain us and all of                                 these groups also have public meetings                                 which are published on YouTube so even                                 if you are not able to attend then you                                 can view those and all meetings also                                 have meeting notes if you're not a fan                                 of watching lengthy video recordings                                 this is something that Tim's mentioned                                 in his talk I just want to reiterate on                                 this we                                 have three India specific slack channels                                 in the kubernetes slack a lot of folks I                                 think like                                                           there on the in-depth channel already                                 but if you're not already on this                                 channel please join it and if you are                                 already on this channel say hi                                 drop a line or two about who you are                                 what you work on and what you would like                                 to work on in the community the in users                                 channel is for users of kubernetes the                                 in events channel is for events                                 happening in India just like this one or

speakers and                                 cfp so this is a good Avenue to figure                                 out where you can give a talk as well if                                 you're not

                      you are interested in it won't take too                                 much time please check it out but                                 contributions are not just about code                                 they can be about much more than that so                                 if you are interested in something like                                 project management on helping run                                 contributor events like contributor                                 summits or being a moderator for YouTube                                 slack or we also have code of code of                                 conduct committees and communication and                                 from all of these places that you can                                 contribute to without involving code we                                 also have dedicated of mentoring                                 programs in the upstream project the                                 release team especially is an excellent                                 example of this I'm pretty sure there                                 are folks over here who have been                                 previously on the release team and also                                 on the current release team the release                                 team has specific rules define and rural                                 handbooks and each role has a lead and                                 multiple shadows so you can become a                                 lead                                 you basically shadows our mentees and                                 leads our mentors and in the next                                 release cycle you can even become the
