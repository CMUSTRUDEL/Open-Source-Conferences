A Safari into the KubeVerse - Dhananjay Sathe, Rapyuta Robotics 

Kubernetes is for the most part is a whole new universe where the wonders of kubectl and friends enchant the amateur onlooker with the magical objects of pods, self healing deployments, networks all operating in the promised land of #webscale. The talk intends to demistify the basic workings of kubernetes by following the common kubectl command as it traverses the kubeverse by gently introducing a treasure trove of "shiny new things" like the API server, admission control, initializers, the GVK, objects, controllers, informers.
