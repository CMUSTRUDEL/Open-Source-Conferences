Auditing in Kubernetes 101 - Nikhita Raghunath, Loodse 

Have you ever wondered who created particular changes in your cluster, when they created it or what resources were modified? All of such information about “what sequence of events lead to this scenario” can be obtained using the powerful audit logging feature. In this talk, we will first go over what audit logs are and how to leverage them to stay informed with what goes on in your cluster. Keeping both performance impact and accountability in mind, we will then walk through examples of policy configurations to enforce best security practices, detect misuse and make your cluster more compliant. We’ll also do a demo of setting up auditing on a cluster and inspecting the logs. Finally, we will see what future improvements are planned for this feature and how you can provide feedback and get involved.
