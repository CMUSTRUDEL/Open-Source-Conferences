Turtles All the Way Down: Inception for Kubernetes - Hardik Dodiya, SAP 

Kubernetes has evolved into the de-facto platform for managing cloud-native workloads with consistent development and operational experience across infrastructure providers. But there is one workload which Kubernetes doesn't normally manage: Kubernetes itself! We study the design, benefits, and challenges of the INCEPTION model: treating Kubernetes as yet another application for Kubernetes to run. This is accomplished with standard means (eg, StatefulSets, Services, Machines via Cluster-API) and is productively used in SAP's open-source project Gardener. By enabling Kubernetes as an INCEPTION platform, we drastically reduce the management complexity by avoiding imperative toolsets, whilst extending the capabilities and scope of Kubernetes itself. Lastly, we show a live demo of how this works in practice. We also discuss opportunities for this work in the sig-cluster-lifecycle.
