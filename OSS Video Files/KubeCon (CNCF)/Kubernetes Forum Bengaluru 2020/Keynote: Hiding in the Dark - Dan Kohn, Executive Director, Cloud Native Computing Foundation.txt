	                              good morning Bengaluru I am so thrilled                               to be back here for the second year in a                               row for kubernetes forum Bengaluru we                               have a spectacular turnout of sold-out                               with twenty one hundred attendees and I                               would like to thank all of you for                               coming today                               so I want to give you a little bit of a                               background the cloud native computing                                foundation is the organization that                                hosts these open source projects and                                organizes this event we also publish the                                cloud native definition quote one of                                CNCs goals is to democratize                                state-of-the-art patterns to make                                innovations accessible for everyone in                                order to share with you a short parable                                about this democratization I need to                                introduce my family we live in New York                                City where my wife Julie is a climate                                scientist she couldn't be here this week                                but her climate change forecasting                                startup Jupiter intelligence uses                                kubernetes this is our younger son                                Ellis who's                                                         front row he and his brother were able                                to join me for their first-ever trip to                                India                                Ellis throws a solid fastball this is                                our older son Adam who just became a                                teenager and this is our cat Kouros now                                when Adam was just a seven-year-old                                second grader a bunch of his friends                                started playing Minecraft so I installed                                it on his iPad and a week later I found                                Adams sitting on the couch but with an                                iPad screen instead of books and no                                little brother and with the frightened                                expression like this but the strange                                part was that his iPad screen was black                                why are you staring at a black screen I                                asked I'm hiding from the zombies he                                replied I don't see any zombies I said                                the zombies come out when the Sun sets                                he explained the screen is black                                he said because I'm hiding in a hole in                                a hill you see minecraft might look like                                this during the day but at night the                                zombies come out and my second grader                                had not yet learned any of the ways that                                he might defeat zombies but he had                                figured out that he could dig a hole                                with his hands and close it in around                                himself until the screen went black                                this story is a metaphor the                                second-grader represents most                                enterprises                                although kubernetes cross the chasm last                                year the majority of all enterprises are                                still not cloud native zombies represent                                software failures specifically anything                                that can cause downtime hiding in a hole                                represents precautionary practices such                                as long release cycles infrequent                                dependency updates and manual quality                                assurance now I want to emphasize that                                for both second-graders and for most                                enterprises they are not acting                                irrationally the zombies are real                                precautionary practices are a reasonable                                response I also want to make clear that                                in comparing enterprises to second                                graders I'm not exempting my own                                organization CNC F is part of the Linux                                Foundation we host software including                                Linux nodejs                                and let's encrypt and yet projects we've                                undertaken like an open-source CoA bots                                have been delayed the solution for my                                second grader Adam was to arrange for                                the older sibling of a classmate to come                                over a fourth grader and the fourth                                grader taught us about crafting tables                                you know how when you combine software                                development with information technology                                operations you get DevOps well similarly                                minecraft consists of mining and                                crafting and my second grader had                                figured out how to mine on his own or at                                least how to dig with his arms but he                                didn't know how to craft and crafting is                                critical to the                                game let's take a look at a simple                                crafting example take a pumpkin some                                sugar and an egg combine them using a                                crafting table to get a pumpkin pie                                yummy but not so useful so let's take a                                more complex example that will help us                                stop zombies chop a tree to get wood                                 which you form into wood planks and then                                 used to make a stick                                 now kill a spider using a bow and arrow                                 to get some string now dig and gravel to                                 find flint and kill chicken to get a                                 feather and finally combine these using                                 a crafting table to create a bow and                                 some arrows as long as you ignore the                                 circular dependency error the lesson of                                 Minecraft is that you can take simple                                 things and combine them together into                                 more complex things to build very                                 powerful tools and here at kubernetes                                 forum bengaluru we're doing the same                                 thing as you probably know kubernetes                                 uses the firewall technology iptables                                 to create networking connections between                                 pods iptables depends of course on Linux                                 and specifically the networking                                 subsystem the first Linux firewall IPFW                                 originated from BSD it was replaced with                                 IPFW a ADM the Internet Protocol                                 firewall administrator which was more                                 complete and easier to use                                 this was reimplemented as IP chains                                 which was superseded by IP tables as                                 part of the Nelnet filter system it is                                 now being reimplemented using EBP eff                                 the extended berkeley packet filter                                 which has an awesome logo so firewalls                                 are a core building block of kubernetes                                 that have been crafted into more                                 advanced forms over time but so are C                                 groups and the domain name system and                                 the raft distributed consensus algorithm                                 implemented at CD in fact kubernetes is                                 built on hundreds of foundational                                 technologies that have been combined                                 together but I would go a step further                                 and argue that kubernetes itself is like                                 a crafting table it is a kind of alchemy                                 that turns simpler things into more                                 powerful ones kubernetes in short is                                 like Minecraft you have all the tools                                 needed to build what you want and even                                 tools to build new tools but what we                                 construct is up to us finally where do                                 the fourth graders and the second                                 graders come together to share their                                 crafting formulas the answer is                                 kubernetes forums and also cubic on                                 cloud native con please raise your hand                                 now if this is the first kubernetes                                 event you've ever attended fantastic                                 about half or two-thirds you are the                                 metaphorical second graders and what's                                 the benefit to the fourth graders there                                 are two first after we got educated                                 about crafting my son Adam gave the                                 fourth grader a cookie no I mean a                                 cookie the metaphorical fourth graders                                 in the audience who can provide                                 assistance to those second graders may                                 find that they are showered with cookies                                 and you know job offers and the second                                 and even more important reason is that                                 the second graders will soon enough                                 become fourth graders in our community                                 where democratization is a core value is                                 eagerly looking for people who can                                 contribute new and improved crafting                                 ideas kubernetes is only five years old                                 which means that we are all still in                                 elementary school I look forward to                                 seeing what we will learn from each                                 other thank you very much
