Intelligent Workload Re-shuffling to Minimize Idle Resources Across Cluster - Yash Bhatnagar & Hemani Katyal, VMware 

A common problem in kubernetes is the fragmentation of available resources across nodes. Inadvertently, pods eventually end up getting scheduled across nodes in such a way that for any new pod, ALL the resources requested by it are collectively unavailable at any single node, making the pod un-schedulable. Even though your overall cluster might have much more capacity available across the nodes, a scale-up is still needed. It creates a "pseudo" resource crunch that could be simply avoided by carefully re-scheduling the pods across the nodes. In this session, we will present an efficient, smart but yet simple solution that, whenever possible: 1) Provides a feasible migration plan to any fit new pods stuck waiting for resources, within the existing infrastructure 2) Avoids such a fragmented scenario by periodically balancing the resources on the k8s nodes.
