Resiliency Patterns in Kubernetes - Ravi Hari & Lakshminarayanan S, Intuit 

Kubernetes being a de facto standard for container deployments and orchestration the applications running on kubernetes platform should be highly available and resilient to failures. With Nodes and Pods being ephemeral in kubernetes there are high chances for application users/clients to get 504 or 502 (5xx) errors when a node restarts or a pod gets terminated. This session discusses how Intuit came up with these resiliency patterns and have applied in Kubernetes clusters and applications run in them avoid the failures. This session also talks about Life-Cycle manager an open source project (https://github.com/keikoproj/lifecycle-manager) which uses lifecycle hooks from the autoscaling group to pre-drain the instances and it will also deregister the instance from any discovered ALB target group to avoid in-flight 5xx errors.
