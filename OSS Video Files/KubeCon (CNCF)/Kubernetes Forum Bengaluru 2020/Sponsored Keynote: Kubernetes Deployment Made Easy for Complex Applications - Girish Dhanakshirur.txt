Sponsored Keynote: Kubernetes Deployment Made Easy for Complex Applications - Girish Dhanakshirur, Distinguished Engineer & CTO | Cloud Pak System, IBM Mobile Foundation, IBM Hybrid Cloud 

Containers are the new fabric for cloud native applications, bringing simplicity in packaging and portability to developers. However, container images by themselves do not address key enterprise needs for production applications. Beyond containers and Kubernetes, developers need to orchestrate their production topology, and to provide management, security and governance of their applications. Girish Dhanakshirur will share the lessons learned during IBM's journey of containerization and how IBM sees Kubernetes fit in the broader IBM strategy.

	                              good morning everyone for the next maybe                               about five to six minutes                               you know I'd spend some time so by the                               way I'm one of the CEOs in the cloud                               division where the week spent good                               amount of time playing with some of                               these technologies building on top of                               this and again you know contributing                               back back to the community so for the                                next maybe five six minutes you know I'd                                spend some time on applications                                application platforms and you know how                                that that fits into into communities                                I do participate in many of the meetups                                here in Bangalore I'm based out of                                Bangalore so you can hit me on Twitter                                Gary's deed tweets so I mean like myself                                I think many of you have been you know                                building applications for quite some                                time I'm guessing so so perhaps some                                   to                                             we pretty much had you know just two                                technologies we were building                                applications right so there was Java or                                there was dotnet right so those were the                                two technologies or two two languages                                where we were you know building                                applications the developers were focused                                on building applications and the heavy                                lifting of deploying those applications                                was done by the underlying application                                platforms so the role of application                                platform was doing essentially you know                                heavy lifting from security scalability                                integration and in doing most of the                                boring job you know while giving the                                time back to you as application                                developers to focus on you know building                                best of the best applications so what                                has changed you know over the period of                                last you know maybe about                                               we are doing the same thing or somewhat                                similar in the cloud in the cloud era                                right so if you're building a similar                                platform to run cloud native                                applications you know so that again you                                know same things around security                                scalability you know are available for                                these cloud native applications so there                                are some expectations from from the                                application platform so DIMMs talk                                talked about                                you know what makes the kubernetes and                                you know what what it forms is that as a                                base so there are certain things for                                developers where you know developers ask                                for you know can I build a stateful                                application let's say a database can I                                build a web application a stateless web                                application or you know I want to build                                an event-driven application let's say in                                a service application and of course you                                know the platform has to be you know                                very simple and flexible so there are                                many application platform vendors you                                know focused on building you know all                                and and addressing all of these                                requirements so in cloud native world so                                we see in essentially that these three                                styles or these three programming styles                                right so there's one which is twelve                                factor applications you know which is                                primarily driven by cloud foundry you                                know the project in CNC F then there's                                cloud functions you know from IBM as                                your functions from Microsoft lambda so                                these are service applications and the                                last one is about container izing and                                deploying container based applications                                of course you know on top of kubernetes                                so the good news is you know over the                                period of let's say last three four                                years the community has come together                                you know while there were many projects                                for doing many things the community has                                come together in order to create you                                know some sort of you know opinionated                                stack so for example you know we were                                more or less settled on container engine                                to be container d and again you know                                we're sort of you know settled on the                                orchestration layer based on kubernetes                                and then of course you know there are                                new projects like service mash service                                catalog came native you know there we                                are converging on you know many of these                                projects coming together to create that                                opinionated stack so you know we're                                proud to say that IBM has built you know                                 that particular stack and today IBM                                 container kubernetes container service                                 on public cloud is built on the stack                                 and we want millions of applications or                                 billions of containers today                                 it's not just running your applications                                 so we also have built in a good amount                                 of our investment you know things around                                 Watson                                 things around you know machine learning                                 services things around databases Cloud                                 Foundry functions sto many of these                                 today run on the same kubernetes                                 platform and you know I don't want to                                 encourage most of you in the crowd to                                 also participate and you know contribute                                 towards this upstream projects and                                 actively I mean just like you know what                                 we're doing at IBM you know I would look                                 forward you know for many of you to be                                 also actively participating in these                                 projects so let me switch the gear a                                 little bit you know of course that's our                                 public cloud story and you know share a                                 little bit about what we do with our                                 clients when we look at our clients                                 again I'm bringing this up because you                                 know many of us here in Bangalore you                                 know working in most of the GSIS and                                 there are many of the other captive                                 companies so we focus on this you know                                 this type of projects so there's a                                 customers are looking to move existing                                 applications over to cloud continue                                 rising them in or building brand new                                 applications using cloud native                                 technologies and run it on containers                                 and the last one is about you know how                                 do I manage this massive infrastructure                                 you know running very complex                                 applications so I'll illustrate this                                 with you know a very simple example you                                 know what we did with American Airlines                                 so if you look at if you if you look at                                 this picture it's about using what we                                 call as a strangler pattern where you                                 run both new and existing in parallel                                 and you know while you know they                                 continue to coexist                                 you know you slowly turn off the traffic                                 coming to the old and then you know you                                 send it more and more towards you know                                 the new applications while delivering                                 features to both until at a tipping                                 point where the the traffic you know you                                 have you have a critical mass of users                                 using the new and then you can turn off                                 the old the reason I'm bringing this up                                 is because today what we have in the                                 community what we're building around                                 kubernetes and you know many of the                                 projects many of the technologies allows                                 us to do many of these or                                 these patterns so at IBM in addition to                                 what we do on public cloud viewing heads                                 down for last couple of years container                                 izing our entire middleware stack to be                                 certified on kubernetes right so this                                 essentially you know we're taking our                                 existing products and products portfolio                                 and container izing them and what we                                 call these as cloud packs so we have                                 about six of them today so these cloud                                 packs basically range in all the way                                 from delivering offerings from Watson to                                 WebSphere to Watson business process                                 automation to block chains to api's to                                 mobile services so we embarked in a                                 whole slew of these things we're                                 building and we re basing most of these                                 products and middleware on kubernetes                                 and the fact that we are running this on                                 top of this open source platform you                                 know allows us to scale very well and                                 you know participate in broader                                 ecosystem so these cloud packs are                                 certified secured and you know ready to                                 go on day one and you know these cloud                                 packs are available for customers to run                                 it on public cloud private cloud                                 on-premises or whatever so so we've been                                 very active you know in the community                                 and you know we continue to work with CN                                 CF and see many of the new projects or                                 upcoming projects and actively                                 participate and you know we look forward                                 to you know working more more closely in                                 the community thank you                                 you
