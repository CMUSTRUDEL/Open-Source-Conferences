Sponsored Keynote: Kubernetes Deployment Made Easy for Complex Applications - Girish Dhanakshirur, Distinguished Engineer & CTO | Cloud Pak System, IBM Mobile Foundation, IBM Hybrid Cloud 

Containers are the new fabric for cloud native applications, bringing simplicity in packaging and portability to developers. However, container images by themselves do not address key enterprise needs for production applications. Beyond containers and Kubernetes, developers need to orchestrate their production topology, and to provide management, security and governance of their applications. Girish Dhanakshirur will share the lessons learned during IBM's journey of containerization and how IBM sees Kubernetes fit in the broader IBM strategy.
