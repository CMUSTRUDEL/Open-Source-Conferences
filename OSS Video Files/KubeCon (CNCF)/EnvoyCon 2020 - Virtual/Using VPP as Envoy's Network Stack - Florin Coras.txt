	Using VPP as Envoy's Network Stack - Florin Coras

Vector Packet Processing (VPP), part of fd.io, is a high performance, layer 2-7 scalable and multi-platform user space networking stack. Typical VPP use cases include, amongst others, deployments as a vSwitch/Router, Firewall, Load Balancer and TCP Proxy. This talk will discuss how some of the recent socket layer API changes can be leveraged to cleanly integrate Envoy with VPP's socket layer, the VPP Comms Library (VCL), and some of the potential benefits thereof.
