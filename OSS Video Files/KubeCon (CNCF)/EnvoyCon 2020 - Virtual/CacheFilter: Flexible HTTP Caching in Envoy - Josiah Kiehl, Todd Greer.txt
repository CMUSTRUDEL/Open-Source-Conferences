	CacheFilter: Flexible HTTP Caching in Envoy - Josiah Kiehl, Todd Greer

Web traffic relies extensively on caching proxies, and Envoy needs robust HTTP caching support to perform that role, but scaling and feature requirements vary too much for a "one size fits all" implementation. CacheFilter is an Envoy filter that handles the many caching-related request and response headers and directives, with the customizability and extensibility to support anything from single-server deployments to planetary-scale caching systems with extensive bespoke needs.
