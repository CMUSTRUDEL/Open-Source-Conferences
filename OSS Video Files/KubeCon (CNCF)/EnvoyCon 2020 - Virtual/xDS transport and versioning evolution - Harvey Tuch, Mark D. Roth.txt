	xDS transport and versioning evolution - Harvey Tuch, Mark D. Roth

Envoy’s xDS APIs are the foundation for its control plane ecosystem. We are in the process of evolving them towards the Universal Data Plane API (UDPA), supporting clients beyond Envoy (e.g. Google’s gRPC libraries). We also continue to improve support for versioning in xDS and are following on from last year's introduction of major versions with minor/patch versions.

In the first part of this talk, we will dive into UDPA. We will focus on the next steps in the xDS transport protocol evolution. We will provide an introduction to a new URI-centric resource naming scheme and how this will allow for transport simplifications and elimination of technical debt in both Envoy and the control plane. We will also cover advanced use cases, such as federation, caching, control plane scalability and reliability wins.

In the second part of this talk, we will provide a recap on Envoy's existing API versioning story and discuss the implementation of minor/patch versioning for xDS resources. This incremental strategy is the plan-of-record for xDS, managing the trade-off between Envoy/xDS technical debt and control plane complexity/implementation cost.
