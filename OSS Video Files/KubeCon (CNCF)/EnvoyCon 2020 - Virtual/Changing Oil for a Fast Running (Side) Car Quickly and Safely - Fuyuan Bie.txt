	Changing Oil for a Fast Running (Side) Car Quickly and Safely - Fuyuan Bie

While we all want our features in production ASAP, safety - on the other hand - is the last thing we should sacrifice. At Pinterest, mesh configuration story looks like this: - thousands clusters - under 25 minutes to fully deploy through all stages and availability zones serially - 0 incidents during xDS v3 migration - every change is validated individually - full visibility into change and client history Thanks to comprehensive pre-deploy validation, holistic health checks and a specially designed feedback channel based on xDS, configuration roll-out is safe and yet very fast. The machinery carries every config change to VMs, dockerized hosts, and k8s automatically. Should an issue happen, it can spot the problem within a minute. In this talk, we will share the architecture, design considerations, good practices, and lessons learned along our path towards configuration nirvana.
