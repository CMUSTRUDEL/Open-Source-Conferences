	Building idiomatic Envoy SDKs for Rust and Go - Yaroslav Skopets, Takeshi Yoneda

Support for WebAssembly is slowly coming into upstream Envoy.

Eager to get our hands dirty, we've embarked on a journey to develop our very first Envoy extensions in Rust and Go - languages beloved by the Cloud Native Community.

It's been a bumpy ride and we're happy we've made it :)

In this session we will share our learnings from building Envoy SDKs for Rust and Go:
* what challenges we've met
* what issues remain open
* what makes SDK ergonomic

We will give a demo of practical extensions that have been made possible so far and, most certainly, will beg Envoy folks to give us even more features we miss so much :)

Our goal is to raise awareness in the community about the current state of Wasm, and to invite everyone to collaborate on the SDK for the language of their choice.
