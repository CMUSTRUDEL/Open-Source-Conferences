Cloud-Init with Crossplane - Marques Johansson, Equinix

Baremetal and VM instances provisioned with Crossplane must rely on user-data fields or other forms of provisioners. It is only with these additional provisioning steps that it is possible to replicate managed services on bare metal or managed infrastructure. Cloud-init is a standard format for user-data that allows for numerous config files or scripts to be combined, all in different formats. Cloud-init data can be lengthy and cloud providers limit the size of user data. It is often necessary to combine and compress cloud-init scripts. We’ll explore ways to leverage cloud-init as user-data, demonstrating the higher-order integrations that are possible when Crossplane manages low-level resources.
