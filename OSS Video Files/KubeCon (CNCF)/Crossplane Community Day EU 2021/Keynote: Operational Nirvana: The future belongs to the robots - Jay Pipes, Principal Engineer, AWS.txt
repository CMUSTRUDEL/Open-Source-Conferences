Keynote: Operational Nirvana: The future belongs to the robots - Jay Pipes, Principal Engineer, Amazon Web Services

AWS Controllers for Kubernetes (ACK) lets you define and use AWS service resources directly from Kubernetes. The ACK project has a code generator that is now used for generating the Crossplane AWS provider. In this talk, we will discuss why declarative Kubernetes-native configuration management tools like ACK and Crossplane are so important: they enable a GitOps-centric operational model for safely deploying infrastructure and application resources.
