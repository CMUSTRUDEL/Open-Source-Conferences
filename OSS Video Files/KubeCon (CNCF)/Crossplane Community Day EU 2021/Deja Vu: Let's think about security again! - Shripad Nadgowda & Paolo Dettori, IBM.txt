Deja Vu: Let's think about security again! - Shripad Nadgowda & Paolo Dettori, IBM

While Crossplane is emerging as the new CNCF project for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure directly from Kubernetes, according to the National Security Agency (NSA), misconfiguration is still the #1 cloud vulnerability. So as we move the control plane for managing infrastructure to Kubernetes through Crossplane, we need to revisit and re-evaluate security and compliance implications.   In this talk, we will review on-going security transformations for cloud-native solutions  in the form of DevSecOps, Zero Trust and discuss their potential applicability to Crossplane. At the same time, it is equally critical to identify early if there any any gaps, need for new tools and techniques for developers and security experts and call for common best practices or standards across users and providers.
