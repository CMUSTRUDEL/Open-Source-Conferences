Lightning Talk: Crossplane - An Extensible Approach in Distributing Workloads - Jason Bonafide, Dell

With systems practicing multi-cloud strategies or even migrating from one cloud-provider to another, there may be a need to programmatically instantiate new workload clusters. At Dell Technologies, Jason has leveraged Crossplane in providing functional extensibility at the application-level in creating Kubernetes workload clusters across different clouds. Jason aims to share some of the lessons learned in leveraging Crossplane as the facilitator in creating Kubernetes resources for the different cloud strategies.
