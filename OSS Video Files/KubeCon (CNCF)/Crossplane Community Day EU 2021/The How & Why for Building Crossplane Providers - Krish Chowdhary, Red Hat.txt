The How & Why for Building Crossplane Providers - Krish Chowdhary, Red Hat

Provisioning and managing cloud resources like infrastructure, services, and applications are one of the core features offered by Crossplane. We achieve this goal by creating independent Providers which expose Custom Resource Definitions in a Kubernetes cluster. Although the development of these Providers is community-driven, there are overarching design patterns that exist in all the Providers. In this talk, we will be going over the fundamentals of Crossplane Providers, the architecture, and how to contribute. Additionally, we will talk about the how and why for creating a Provider, what drives the use case, and when is it a good idea to create a Provider as opposed to other options like Helm Charts, Operators, or Kustomize resources. We will wrap up the talk by bootstrapping the development of a new Provider, as well as a small demo for creating a new resource.
