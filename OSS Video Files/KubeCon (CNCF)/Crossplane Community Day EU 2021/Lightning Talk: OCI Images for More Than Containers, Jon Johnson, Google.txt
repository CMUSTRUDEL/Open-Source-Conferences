Lightning Talk: OCI Images for More Than Containers, Jon Johnson, Google

OCI images have become synonymous with containers, yet the fact that they are used for running containerized processes is nothing more than an implementation detail. In reality, OCI images are capable of packaging arbitrary data, and because of the wide proliferation of registry offerings, they are an attractive distribution mechanism for hosting and sharing standardized artifacts. In this talk, Jon and Dan will peel back the layers of the OCI image specification, exploring what components are required and which are optional, as well as how to build your own images by hand. The Crossplane package manager’s usage of the go-containerregistry library will serve as a reference for how these concepts can be used in practice. Attendees will leave with a greater knowledge of how Crossplane works under the hood, and how OCI images may be used to solve their own artifact distribution problems.
