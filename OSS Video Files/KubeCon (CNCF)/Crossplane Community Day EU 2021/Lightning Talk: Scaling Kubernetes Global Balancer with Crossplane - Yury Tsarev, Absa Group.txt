Lightning Talk: Scaling Kubernetes Global Balancer with Crossplane - Yury Tsarev, Absa Group

Global load balancing, commonly referred to as GSLB (Global Server Load Balancing) solutions, have typically been the domain of proprietary network software and hardware vendors and installed and managed by siloed network teams. k8gb is a completely open source, cloud native, global load balancing solution for Kubernetes. k8gb focuses on load balancing traffic across geographically dispersed Kubernetes clusters using multiple load balancing strategies to meet requirements such as region failover for high availability. Absa runs more than a hundred GSLB enabled clusters and the number is continuously growing. To handle the configuration overhead Absa uses the combination of Crossplane XRD abstracting and simplifying k8gb deployment configuration for cluster operators, minimizing the potential human errors and enabling GitOps best practices for huge scale hybrid cloud deployment.
