Outgrowing Terraform - Nic Cope, Upbound & Dalorion Johnson, Guidewire

Curious how Crossplane compares to Terraform? In this session Dalorion and Nic will discuss some of the challenges organisations can face when they need to scale their Terraform use to empower multiple teams to collaborate on declarative infrastructure management, and how Crossplane addresses these challenges. The session will be rooted in Dalorion’s experiences building and managing advanced Terraform configurations for a large software engineering organisation. Nic will highlight how the kind of challenges faced by Guidewire have informed Crossplane’s architectural decisions, allowing it to overcome some of Terraform’s pain points.
