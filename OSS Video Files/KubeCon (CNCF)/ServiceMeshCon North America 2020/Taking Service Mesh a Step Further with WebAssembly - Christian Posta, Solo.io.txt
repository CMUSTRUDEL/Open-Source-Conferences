	Taking Service Mesh a Step Further with WebAssembly - Christian Posta, Solo.io

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. Wasm support in Envoy means that that opens up new possibilities in customizing service meshes built on Envoy with modules that modify the behavior of the sidecar proxy in any language. The possibilities are endless and in this talk we will explain: - The state of Wasm in Envoy and how it works - Demonstrate the developer experience in building, sharing, and deploying modules - Demonstrate a range of modules types and the kind of behavior it can customize in the sidecar proxy
