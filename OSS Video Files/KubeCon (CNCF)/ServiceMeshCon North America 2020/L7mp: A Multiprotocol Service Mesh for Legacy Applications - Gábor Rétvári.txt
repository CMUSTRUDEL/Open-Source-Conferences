	L7mp: A Multiprotocol Service Mesh for Legacy Applications - Gábor Rétvári, Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME)

The service mesh is too cool to keep it HTTP-only! Despite the increasing use of HTTP as a common application transport protocol, there are tons of legacy non-HTTP applications that would greatly benefit from the traffic management and monitoring capabilities provided by a service mesh. Primary examples are anything that runs on top of UDP or SCTP, including telco apps, VPN, IoT, video-gaming, or DNS. Currently, these applications are left behind by the cloud-native community. Taking a real telco media-plane use case as demonstrator, this talk makes the case for l7mp, a joint industry-academy effort to build a service mesh prototype with first-class support for legacy applications. L7mp aspires to serve as an incubator project to experiment with radically new service mesh designs and features, including full multi-protocol support, programmable protocol L7 parsing, native stream-management, and kernel-based offload for sidecar proxy acceleration.
