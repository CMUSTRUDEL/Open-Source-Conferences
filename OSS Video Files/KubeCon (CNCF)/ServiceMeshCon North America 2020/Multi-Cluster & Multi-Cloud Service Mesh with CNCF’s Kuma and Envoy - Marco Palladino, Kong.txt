	Multi-Cluster & Multi-Cloud Service Mesh with CNCF’s Kuma and Envoy - Marco Palladino, Kong

Learn how to run a distributed Envoy-based service mesh on multiple Kubernetes clusters and multiple clouds in just a few steps with Kuma, a CNCF project. In this session, we'll be firing up Kubernetes clusters in multiple regions to demonstrate how we can secure, route, connect and observe service connectivity in a distributed service mesh.   In this session, we will learn to:  - Use Kuma’s multi-zone deployment to spin up a multi-cluster and multi-region service mesh. - Leverage the global/remote control separation to scale reliability with HA.  - Use the built-in service discovery and ingress capability for out of the box service connectivity across multiple zones, clusters and regions.  - Use Kuma’s policy to determine the behavior of traffic across different clusters, like Traffic Route, mTLS, Traffic Permission and so on.
