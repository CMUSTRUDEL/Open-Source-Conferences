welcome to servicemeshcon 2020. i am

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,799
marco palladino

00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:09,040
cto and co-founder of conch and i'm very

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,280
excited to be here today

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,400
today we're going to be exploring the

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,040
state of the art

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,720
of service mesh in our industry explain

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,640
to us from the makers

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
and the users of the service mesh

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,240
ecosystem

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,640
the goal for today is to capture

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,119
actionable insights on service mesh

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,560
what options we have best practices what

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,080
to do and what not to do

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,239
when deploying a service mesh in

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
production but first

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,800
let's take a look at why service mesh is

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,600
important and let's start by exploring

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,320
the single

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,200
most important thing that every modern

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,320
application

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,120
must do right connectivity

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,039
and that is because every time a team

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,120
builds any new application

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,960
they create connectivity and the more

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:55,199
distributed and decoupled

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,960
our applications become and the more

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
connectivity we have

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,039
the thing is our services really do talk

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
to each other a lot

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,119
if our services were people they would

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,560
never be invited at any party

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,600
they talk non-stop over http over jrpc

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,560
over kafka database protocols and so on

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,680
so let me tell you a story about how

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
i've discovered

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,600
that this was important when i was the

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,080
cto at mache

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,799
and we transitioned to microservices we

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,799
were so

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,080
focused on the applications themselves

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
and decoupling them

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
from the old monolithic code base that

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
we didn't think

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,400
about connectivity as much as we should

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
have

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
we almost took for granted that our

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,360
cloud vendor

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,439
would provide fast and reliable

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,280
connectivity for our services

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,240
and we learned a very hard lesson that

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,320
day when we ran our new architecture

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
nothing worked the way it was supposed

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,399
to work connections were slow and

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,200
reliable they were failing all the time

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,000
we had to spend a lot of time building

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,719
and fixing

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,600
that connectivity ourselves it was very

00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:59,840
painful

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
it was like sailing around the world and

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,439
focusing so much on the immediate needs

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,439
like the gear and the boat

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,880
but forgetting to bring food on board

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,319
and so halfway through we're going to be

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,479
having a big problem

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,400
we didn't think of connectivity until it

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,959
was too late

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,000
don't make the same mistake i made in a

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,640
digital world

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,520
we succeed with reliable fast and secure

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,000
connections

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
across all of our services when

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,200
connectivity doesn't work

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,040
our applications don't work so

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,560
if the application teams are in charge

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,560
of building the products

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,160
and the architects are in charge of

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,280
building infrastructure

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,040
who is in charge of building

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,480
connectivity is it the application teams

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,480
or is it the architects

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,560
it should be the architects but today in

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,280
most organizations

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,760
it is the application teams the problem

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,840
is

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,800
when the application teams build service

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,800
connectivity

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,480
they're not doing their job their job is

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,040
to build the products and make the users

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,599
happy

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,239
not managing connectivity and because of

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,640
that

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,159
they lose efficiency and we the

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,040
architects lose control

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,599
of our own infrastructure with service

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
mesh

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
we turn the application teams into

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,680
consumers of connectivity

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,000
while providing the right technology for

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,800
the architects to build it

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,720
so today we will explore a variety of

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
different service mesh implementations

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
and user stories that will help us

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
become the super

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,560
hero of connectivity and build reliable

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
distributed software

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
to create value in our business and in

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,319
the world

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,280
and with this let's get started with the

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,360
first talk

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
