Level Setting the Cloud Native Edge: Definitions and Core Principles - Keith Basil, Rancher

Everyone has a different definition of the “edge”. Collectively we’ve found it useful to establish a baseline definition of the edge so that meaningful discussions can ensue. In this talk we will review an example framework that has evolved over time during the natural interactions with engineering, partners and those doing real-world cloud-native edge deployments. Borrowing from the aforementioned framework, the session will also succinctly highlight core principals and attributes that are present in the majority of the Kubernetes edge use cases we see today. Attendees of this session will get an introduction to the edge challenges in the areas of application, cluster and operating system management at edge scale.

hello folks welcome to kubernetes on the

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,680
edge day

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,600
my name is keith basil and i'm the vice

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,559
president of product for cloud native

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,200
infrastructure at

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,160
sousa i also helped shape souza's global

00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,679
edge strategy

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,679
and i'm here to talk to you about edge

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,440
today i'd like to thank kubecon

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,880
and the cncf organizers for this

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,359
opportunity to present

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,960
and with that let's get started so i

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,880
wanted to build on the quote that was

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,039
given by the linux foundation and here

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,640
it says the edge computing space will be

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:31,279
four times larger than cloud

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,960
and will generate 75 of the data

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,600
worldwide by 2025.

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
that's a very bold statement and with

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
that statement it gives us quite a bit

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,640
of runway to work

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,000
into that space as we move forward so

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,239
walk with me if you will

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,360
if you can imagine a global deployment

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,360
of 7 500

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
remote locations and within those

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,840
locations you've got a thousand

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,760
industrial iot

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
devices at each one of those locations

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,480
right so when you do the math

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,480
you're looking at 7.5 million things

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,359
that need to be orchestrated and managed

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
at the edge

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,719
and so what i want the big takeaway here

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,119
is that the law

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,360
of large numbers is absolutely at play

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,840
here and we need to be ready to scale

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,880
to meet that challenge and so to add to

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,040
that complexity

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,000
we're seeing deep and diverse edge

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,600
scenarios

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,680
and this goes from underwater

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,680
deployments all the way up to

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,240
satellites in space and everything in

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,080
between and so kubernetes is being used

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,320
to manage cloud native

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,479
applications everywhere across that

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,320
spectrum and so within our ecosystem

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,200
here we have the facilities to tackle

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,960
this challenge

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,560
and before we dive into that let's

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,880
establish a framework for

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
defining what the edge is because

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,840
everybody has a different a different

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,799
definition of edge right and so

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,479
collectively

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,399
we found it very useful to establish

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,920
this baseline definition of edge

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,799
so that we can have meaningful and

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,880
relevant discussions going forward

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
and so the first thing i want to uh to

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,360
walk through here is what we call the

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,159
narrative so

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,680
um just walk with me for a second off to

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
the left-hand side of this screen

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
is the centralized services large data

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,240
centers and the like so

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,240
that's where all the centralized

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,840
services are today and so as you move

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,880
from left to right you get closer and

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,399
closer to the edge

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,399
and first thing not

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,360
edge available so these mech deployments

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,840
are actually very interesting because

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
we're seeing demand for mech solutions

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,640
that support what's on

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
the right-hand side of that line of

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,599
demarcation there and

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,440
there's a few things here that are

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,959
nuanced in the diagram that i want to

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,360
expand on so number one

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,120
the border around that near edge

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,519
definition is meant to represent two

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,680
things

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,760
one it's meant to represent the logical

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,160
network the ip space if you will

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,800
for that segment and it's also meant to

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,239
represent

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
the infrastructure that's within that

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,040
segment and the biggest differentiator

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,120
that

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
at um that supports the definition of

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,080
the near edge is who owns and operates

00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,760
the ip space

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
and who owns and operates the

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,080
infrastructure that's within that space

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
and here

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,519
again as i said this is the realm of the

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
telcos right

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,640
and the last thing i want to call out is

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
that that line of demarcation is

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
critical because

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,280
there are some edge solutions or

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,680
applications where

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,360
the communications providers are

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,959
providing appliances that go

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,120
up to and sit on that line of

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,840
demarcation and if we go back to that

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,560
ipspace definition the ip space that's

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,599
attached that

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,120
to attach to that device is managed by

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,640
the communication service provider in

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,120
fact that gear is typically owned by

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,640
them

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
and they offer services to the end

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,959
customers on the other side of that

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,720
dmarc so

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,480
that's a really critical thing in terms

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,280
of ownership to help us define what that

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,720
near edge

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
scenario is so um let me move to the

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,599
next

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,080
portion which would be the far edge and

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,519
so again we move to the on-premises side

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,879
this is the remote location

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
and this is where things get really

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,799
interesting um and so again

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
the border there is meant to represent

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,360
let's say a layer two domain from a

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,799
networking perspective

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,040
this is customer owned and managed

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,760
ipspace this is customer owned and

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,519
managed

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
uh infrastructure in the form of like

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,920
hardware that supports your kubernetes

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
clusters right

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,439
and so we've got boxes there if you see

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,200
visually represented

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,799
we've got boxes of various sizes to

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,959
represent uh multiple

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,400
cluster sizes so in some for example

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,400
manufacturing use cases

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,919
they've carved out a portion of the data

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,160
center to um sorry

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,680
a portion of the factory to act as a

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,000
small data center and they've got

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
you know classic you know 2u machines

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,160
racked up and

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,919
they it like a data center and those are

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,280
very large clusters we also have

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,320
locations that have

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,080
a single node a single node cluster to

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,160
serve their uses as well

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,919
also they're shown on the screen are

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,440
three broad industries where we see the

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,240
far edge playing right so you've got

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
commercial

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,840
you've got industrial and you've got

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,120
public sector use cases and we think the

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,520
majority of

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,000
the uh edge the far edge use cases will

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,880
fall under those three categories

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,720
and so the the the clusters that are

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,080
running in that space

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,400
typically obviously would support cloud

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,080
native applications and those cloud

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,160
native applications represent a

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,560
transformational business value that's

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,919
actually pushed to that location where

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,240
it can do the best good

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,000
and many of these use cases have the

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,960
local kubernetes clusters within the

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
premises

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,240
to actually aggregate data from uh the

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,320
iot devices and sensors and such and

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,320
that's actually a great segue into the

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
third segment of the edge so so far

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,120
we've talked about

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,440
near edge we just covered far edge and

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,440
finally we've got what we call tiny edge

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,000
and i absolutely love this name i heard

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,240
this

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
uh naming convention at our edge

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,320
conference in the fall

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,120
given by folks from microsoft and this

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,199
is

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,520
really where the law of large numbers

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,960
kicks in so this space is early and we

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,240
are encouraged by the yeoman's work

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
being done by kate

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
goldenring and edward wong in this space

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,639
both of those are

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,400
microsoft uh employees and under their

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,400
leadership microsoft has introduced an

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,039
upstream community called awkry

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,800
um and ocari is all about solving the

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,400
problem that we have in the tiny space

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,840
the tiny edge or the fixed function

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,919
device management space

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,520
and it's really cool and you know at

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,800
susa we want to be involved in that

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,080
that community as well and we would

00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
encourage you to take a look at that and

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
i believe

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,080
later in the day there's uh or at the

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,440
session there's a talk by

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,960
uh edric that speaks about ocry and so

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,160
now that we have a definition a working

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,759
definition of the age let's actually

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,000
talk about the three pillars that make

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,800
up

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
the solution for uh managing kubernetes

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
at scale

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,280
so again i want to come back to this so

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,840
you could have one kubernetes cluster to

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,840
manage

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,440
let's say a thousand downstream clusters

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,479
and these could be globally uh

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,160
geographically the um dispersed um and

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,840
so given the law of large numbers and

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,840
the diversity brought to the table

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,520
we're seeing the three pillars that are

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,560
required to address this management and

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,199
scale challenge

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,680
at the edge and so the first pillar

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
would be

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,240
one uh of the distro right and so we're

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,639
very fortunate on the rancho side to

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,319
have released um k3s to the world and

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,479
it's a very popular distro

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,319
literally with one command line uh you

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,680
can have a cncf certified distro running

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,639
on very lightweight hardware

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,680
and so the the distro is needed because

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,720
importantly

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,440
it allows us to preserve reallocate and

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,759
extend

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,199
our existing investment in kubernetes

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,039
and we can extend that

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,800
that learning that skill set those

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,800
resources to the edge

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
where we need it to go and second we

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
need a distro that thrives in those

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
resource-constrained environments

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,400
through remote locations with limited

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,160
connectivity and also within

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,759
uh as a kubernetes layer in some of the

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,440
edge applications that we're seeing

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,199
appliances rather sorry the app the

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,280
appliances that we're seeing

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
and then the second pillar here is a

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,919
lightweight operating system so there's

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,520
many options there

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,039
where you have a lightweight operating

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,319
system that's container native or

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,440
container native friendly

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,599
there's probably a better way to say

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,400
that and we believe this is required to

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,319
provide

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,560
a low attack footprint from a security

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,479
perspective and also more importantly

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,919
to allow us to manage the full life

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,400
cycle of that operating system

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,080
because when you're managing let's say

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,440
707 500 or anything

00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,199
you know managing the cycle of the

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
operating system should be done in the

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,199
kubernetes way

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,639
right and then lastly the third pillar

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,080
is management and so

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,840
for us on the rancho side it's our

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
rancher management platform but more

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,400
specifically

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,240
it's the ability to adopt a get ops

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,080
approach to managing downstream

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,639
kubernetes clusters at scale

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,400
and so people are precious and those

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,759
that understand our space

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,759
they understand we need to adopt

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,960
technology that that allows us to

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,639
leverage our skill set

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,319
so that we can scale out our management

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,520
capabilities to those large numbers of

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,520
downstream clusters

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,800
and so we think that the getups approach

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,279
is one that naturally

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:37,599
fits the kubernetes declarative model to

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,880
manage infrastructure quite nicely

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,719
and so when you look at all three of

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,240
these pillars we think this is the the

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,599
minimum set that you're going to need to

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,399
have an effective

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,200
kubernetes at scale management solution

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,200
and so again

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,959
kubernetes management at scale with get

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,320
ops is great a lightweight

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,200
distro such as k3s or any other related

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,959
variants

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,399
um and then a lightweight operating

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,959
system that's focused on

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,920
the cloud native um front on the cloud

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,920
native uh

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,680
space and so when you look at it all

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
together you have that solution at the

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,120
bottom

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,880
it will allow you to attack and manage

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
all three segments of the edge so we've

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,000
got the near edge and the telco space

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
that's more of a classic data center

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
play with you know you know

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,519
small data centers or regional data

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
centers we can rack and stack at that

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,160
point

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
that's something that we know very well

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,120
the things get really interesting when

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,480
you come over to the far edge where you

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,279
start deploying a lightweight version of

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,800
kubernetes

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,200
a lightweight operating system and then

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,000
managing that with a declarative get off

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
source of truth

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,200
behind you know let's say 10 000

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,240
deployments and then

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
the tiny edge is emerging uh the acry

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
project we like it

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,959
a lot inside uh rancher and we want to

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,440
again

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,680
contribute to that community but it's

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,600
also very new right so there's a

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,120
handful of protocols that we support on

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
the industrial iot space

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
and we want to make sure we can mature

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,880
uh the capabilities or the adoption of

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
those protocols that are heavily used in

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,959
the in the industrial iot space

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,480
and so this is the complete solution we

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,920
think this is a win for

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,760
for the entire community and we are

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,160
going to be actively working on that and

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,440
so

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,760
ranch is going to be doing a lot of this

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,680
work and we ask that you join us

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,120
in the areas that we've outlined we'd

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,880
love to see the definition of the

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,640
framework that i discussed

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,040
adopted as we believe that it's going to

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,399
be very meaningful to have discussions

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,160
that are efficient in guiding

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,760
us to the solutions that work and

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,760
overall i think we should strive to

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,959
remove the complexity that's inherent in

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,040
our systems right

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,480
and so with that i just want to thank

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,440
you for this opportunity

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,640
and we hope to see you face to face at

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,079
the next coup con

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,120
going forward so thank you again thank

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:45,680
you again for your time and have a great

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,680
