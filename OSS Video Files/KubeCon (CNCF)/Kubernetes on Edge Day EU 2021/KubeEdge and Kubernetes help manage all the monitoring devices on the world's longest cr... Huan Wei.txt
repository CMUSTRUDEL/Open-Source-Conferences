KubeEdge and Kubernetes help manage all the monitoring devices on the world's longest cross-sea bridge - Huan Wei, HarmonyCloud

With a total length of 55 km, the HongKong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge is the longest cross-sea bridge in the world. In order to watch and maintain the safety of the bridge, a large number of sensors are deployed on the bridge, such as temperature sensor, humidity sensor, PM 2.5 sensor, vibration sensor, noise sensor, etc. Then each sensor continuously collects data, processes data locally, and reports the abnormal information to the cloud center for alarm through real-time inference of AI model. In this presentation, Huan will share his experience on: 1) An investigation on common cloud native edge computing frameworks, and the reason why he chose KubeEdge. 2) Introducing how to mapper every kind of devices on the bridge as CRD in Kubernetes. 3) Practice on how to manage applications deployed on edge nodes. 4) Lessons learned and further planning.
