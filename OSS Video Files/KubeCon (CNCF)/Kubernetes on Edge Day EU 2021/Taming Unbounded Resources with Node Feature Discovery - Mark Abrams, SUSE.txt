Taming Unbounded Resources with Node Feature Discovery - Mark Abrams, SUSE

Although Node Feature Discovery (NFD) can be used in any Kubernetes cluster, it's value really shines at the Edge. Kubernetes has 2 notable differences at the Far Edge versus in the data center. 1) The edge exploits and unbounded number of heterogenous resources 2) Enterprises are reporting cluster deployments defined in numbers from hundreds to 10s of thousands. These two characteristics will require management capabilities beyond what use in the data center today. This presentation and demo uses a small fleet of Kubernetes edge clusters and NFD to show how we can build solutions which expose the availability of any arbitrary resource desired. The capabilities proposed by NFD will provide much needed insights into the unbounded capabilities of the massive number of available resources at the Edge.
