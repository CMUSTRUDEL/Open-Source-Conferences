Centralized, distributed or both? - Architectures for Kubernetes on the edge - Gergely Csatari, Nokia & Ildikó Váncsa, Open Infrastructure Foundation

Edge cloud environments are distributed systems that can be implemented in various ways depending on the use case. As edge computing has a broad spectrum, it opens up different architecture choices when Kubernetes is used in the solution. So which parts of Kubernetes should be deployed where? Do you always deploy all components on every site? Does that result in a too large footprint or not? How does it look like with the different cloud platforms that provide infrastructure? In this presentation we will highlight the challenges of different architecture options as well as the problems they solve. You will also learn how Kubernetes fits into the different use cases and architecture options they call for. We will also explore the relevant projects and activities in Kubernetes, such as KubeEdge, K3s, Metal3 and their findings in relation to architecture choices for edge deployments.
