Akri: Using non-Kubernetes devices in Kubernetes - Edrick Wong, Microsoft

As Kubernetes move towards edge computing, a common question is: “Can you run Kubernetes on it?” The natural inclination is to say yes, but after looking at some scenarios, there are many devices that can’t run Kubernetes directly but would benefit from being part of a cluster. For example, sensors and brownfield devices might not have the compute or support for Kubernetes but can ideally be exposed to workloads in the cluster. The goal of this talk is to explain how Akri can be used to empower various edge scenarios. Akri is an open-source project that simplifies the process of discovering, monitoring, and using IoT devices from a Kubernetes cluster, without adding anything to the devices. At its core, Akri aims to address the challenges that come with the diverse set of devices at the edge, each with unique communication protocols and intermittent availability.
