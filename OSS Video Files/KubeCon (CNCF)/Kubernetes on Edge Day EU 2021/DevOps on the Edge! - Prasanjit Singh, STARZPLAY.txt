DevOps on the Edge! - Prasanjit Singh, STARZPLAY

These are exciting times! Three contemporary technologies are on course to define the next decade! "Containers", "AI & ML" and "5G Networks". Why so? That is because, this combination paves the way for a massive disruption - 'Edge computing'. For the uninitiated, 'edge computing' is a distributed computing architecture that moves applications as close as possible to the user base. Edge computing bundled with 5G tech & ML will transform how enterprises run applications and services today. Core to this transformation is the ability of deploying these applications to edge locations. Kubernetes & its ecosystem of utilities will play a defining role here as the edge orchestrator.

In this lightning talk, Prasanjit Singh will articulate on DevOps tools & tailored practices that will define the journey to edge computing and assess where we stand today in terms of edge capabilities.
