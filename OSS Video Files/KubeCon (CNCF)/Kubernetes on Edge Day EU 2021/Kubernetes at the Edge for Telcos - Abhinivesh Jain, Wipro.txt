Kubernetes at the Edge for Telcos - Abhinivesh Jain, Wipro

5G rollout is gaining momentum across the world and in next few years, 5G and Multi access edge computing will become part of our life. Considering the cloud native nature of 5G architecture and huge scale, Kubernetes becomes the defacto standard for Edge application deployment for Telco Edge. This session talks about Telco relevance of various kubernetes distributions, extensions and features. It also covers pros, cons, current state of adoption and future outlook for these. This session will be perfect start for you if you are starting your k8s journey in Telco world.

hello all welcome to this session

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,120
today i'm going to cover kubernetes at

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,240
the edge intel course

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
my name is binivej chen i'm 5gh

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,840
architect

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,840
working in bipro

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,199
some more details about me i'm

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,520
distinguished member of technical staff

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,000
i'm

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,279
open source contributor i'm an author

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,560
blogger

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,560
and frequent speaker

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,280
here is the agenda for today i'm going

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,120
to start with the

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
edge computing and uh so this part is

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
basically

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,200
uh to give a brief overview of edge

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,160
computing

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,960
for people who are not aware of it and

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,440
then

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:49,200
followed by that i will cover telco edge

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,680
overview

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,320
and then why kubernetes is suitable for

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,760
telco edge

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,600
and then i will list down all the

00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,199
requirements that telco have

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,800
from each platform and then we will do a

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,960
mapping of those requirements with

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,240
kubernetes and kubernetes ecosystem

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,479
products right to see the fitment

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,880
and then i will show one telco reference

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,080
architecture

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,920
and towards the end we will see on the

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,520
cncf focus item

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,799
around this telcos and kubernetes

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,119
and then we will conclude this okay so

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,600
let's get started

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,640
so what is such computing as computing

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,520
is

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
all about bringing cloud capabilities to

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
the edge

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,759
so it's like you bring your compute

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:47,119
network storage uh at the edge

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,320
right rather than running things from

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,920
your data center or

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,600
from your cloud which is again

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,720
centralized kind of

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,439
thing now edge computing is not

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,000
a replacement for cloud computing it is

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,360
rather

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,079
going to be a complementary right

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,479
and edge computing will be useful for

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,360
low latency

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,640
uh requirement related application and

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,160
application which

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,080
require real time uh processing okay

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,840
there could be several possible use

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,879
cases and

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,560
in the beginning uh we expect that the

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,120
cloud gaming and

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,040
high quality video delivery will be the

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,120
early adopters

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,239
okay from edge computing market

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,319
perspective

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,160
as per lfh state of the edge report

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,360
i have given the link here in this slide

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,319
so you can

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,519
see the detail uh this global edge

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,800
computing infra market

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,680
will be 800 billion by

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,800
2028 right so there is huge potential in

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,920
this

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,840
and lot of work happening in this area

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,360
okay on the right side of this screen

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,360
you see uh there is a

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,480
prediction from gartner that was done in

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,000
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,239
where gartner said that 75 of

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,040
enterprise generated data will be

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,560
created

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,560
and processed at the edge right by 2025

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,599
now what is telco edge so

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,680
in telco world edge computing is

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,400
commonly referred as

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,319
mobile edge computing or multi-access

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,239
edge computing which is new name of

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,760
mobile edge community and

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,000
there is a standards body called etsy

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
european telecommunications standard

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,400
institute

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,840
so etsy has defined msc reference

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,159
architecture

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,480
and also they have come up with several

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,920
mec apis

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:51,280
okay so you can have a look at etsy

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,760
reference architecture and other details

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,360
now this telco edge is also known as

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,720
service provider edge

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,799
right here edge location is

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,760
within the telco network so telco is

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,040
primarily

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,239
edge which is within control of telcos

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:11,040
right and it could be near edge

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,799
or far edge so when we say near edge it

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,879
is

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
near to the core data center of telco

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,720
right and

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,840
far edge is opposite of it so it could

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,120
be as far as

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,320
customer premise itself and this

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,759
edge computing or the nec is related to

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,919
5g

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:35,360
in fact msc is going to be

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,400
an absolutely necessary component

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,919
for achieving 5g capability

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,840
around your llc which is ultra reliable

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,600
low latency communication

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,199
right so 5g has three main capabilities

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,680
one is urlc other one is embbb

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,720
enhanced mobile broadband and third one

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,520
is

00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,400
mmtc massive machine type communication

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,120
okay so why kubernetes is suitable for

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,120
telco edge

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,720
number one scalability right so

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,199
uh since edge deployment will not be

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,720
like eight or ten uh the typical data

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,919
center deployment they will be in

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,919
thousands

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,440
so uh we need a solution which is

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,560
scalable right where we can do

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,639
deployment in

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
thousands and thousands of sites right

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,000
and which can

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,840
scale according to the needs so let's

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,639
say

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,520
if one particular 5g core component

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,360
needs to be

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,639
scaled up it should be easily possible

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,440
right then second

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,120
suitability parameter is agility so

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,759
kubernetes supports various

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,400
application types right so you can run

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,639
let's say aml workload using queue flow

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,560
you can read serverless using k native

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,199
and so on

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,280
now kubernetes is a container

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,360
orchestration system so it has very good

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,000
orchestration and life cycle management

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,080
capabilities

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,319
and the key feature of kubernetes is it

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,919
has portability across

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,880
hybrid multi-edge cloud so this feature

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,840
helps in

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,840
doing workload migration from

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,960
which could be in public cloud or which

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
could be in

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,039
another edge location on premises

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,000
location

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,400
okay and then kubernetes also give a

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,880
consistent user experience it provides

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,880
site resiliency by using the portability

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,000
then it is also aligned to 5g core

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,759
component

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,400
right let's say upf

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,120
can be placed closer to the consumer

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,479
right

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,479
and other components also and kubernetes

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,319
is also aligned to open ram

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:00,720
and cloud native nature of 5g

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
right so there were major difference

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,840
between 4g and 5g

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,840
that 5g goes 5g rather is

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,400
cloud is following cloud native

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
architecture

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,960
and kubernetes is a synonym to cloud

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,240
native architecture so if something is

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,400
compatible with kubernetes then it is

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
assumed to be compatible with cloud

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
native

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,520
now let's see what are the three

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,560
requirements of telco

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,800
and how does kubernetes and

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,680
its ecosystem map to these requirements

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,919
so

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:39,680
uh various telco companies have

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,039
so many requirements and i've classified

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,240
those requirement into four

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,479
areas one is application area right

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
so from application perspective what i

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,520
mean to say is

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,479
that whatever is the edge platform

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,360
that platform should be capable of

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,840
hosting various types of application

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,479
it could be ai application iot

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,199
application

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,960
serverless application and there should

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,879
be some match application lifecycle

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,599
management

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,199
option also right from network function

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,319
hosting perspective

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,680
telcos are looking for platform that

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,479
helps in hosting cnfs

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,879
which is cloud native network functions

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,360
and

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,039
vnfs also which is virtual network

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,560
function right which are

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:31,360
running on vms right so

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,959
and for private network uh they are

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,640
looking for

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,279
vnf or cnn based hosting right

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,880
and since telco workloads are very

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,560
network intensive there are

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,919
very specific features which are

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,440
required

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:49,440
like huge base support or sri uv support

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,519
even multi interface support real-time

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,959
kernel support cpu pinning

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
pneuma support uh ptp support there are

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,720
many more

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,240
actually right so

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,880
these are the technical features which

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,839
are required in the platform

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:08,000
and from use case perspective use cases

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,000
could be related to cloud gaming related

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,360
to video analytics related to iot edge

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,560
and so on so now let's see so how these

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,320
things are mapped so

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,480
many things are supported as is let's

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,399
say huge face support as a user

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,680
this in kubernetes and few things we can

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,920
uh implement using

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,600
related products projects right like

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,800
cube flow can be used for

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,320
implementing either edge or k native can

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,080
be used for serverless

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,560
similarly cuboid can be used to be in a

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,240
hosting right

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,000
and for tiny edge or iot edge we can

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,959
use kubernetes distributions like k3s

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,640
cube edge micro creators these are very

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,080
small

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,080
uh small footprint based distributions

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
okay so moving to reference architecture

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,480
so

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,560
i mean from previous slides it is clear

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,440
that we

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,560
we need kubernetes to run uh telco edge

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,760
kind of workload but

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:16,000
now how i mean what is the reference

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,880
architecture how do we

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,240
structure these components right so this

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,399
is one of the sample reference

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,279
architecture that i have taken from

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,160
acrino where i'm also one of the active

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,240
member

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,399
so uh in acronym uh kni blueprint which

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,720
is kubernetes native infra blueprint

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,120
the architecture is that at the bottom

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,920
of it you have

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,079
a bare metal server you have virtual

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,680
machines you have a

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,800
public cloud based uh machines like uh

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,360
aws cc2 instances right

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,000
and on top of it you are running either

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,920
uh

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,160
operating system like core os which is

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,680
very suitable for container related

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,120
workload or you might be running some

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,160
real time

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,800
kernel like centos rt right

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,279
and then on top of it you are running

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,920
some software defined storage like chef

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,720
and you have a multi network interface

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,720
supported

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,000
option like multis or cryo for container

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,120
runtime

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,640
and then you run okd right

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,399
which is open source kubernetes

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,519
distribution which is open shift

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,920
open source version right and uh on top

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
of

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,320
uh this kubernetes you run kubert during

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
various virtual machine based workload

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,000
or you run

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,600
container-based workload directly as mec

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
apps and only

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,399
so this is one of the reference

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,440
architecture you can also refer to

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,800
mec reference architecture given by

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,360
etsy right uh

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,519
that very nicely explains how these

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:04,480
components should be

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,519
assigned what is the role of each of

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,040
those components

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,680
and so on so it's a

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,320
recommended architecture and many

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,639
companies

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,639
follow that in fact right and now this

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,120
is one of the reference architecture and

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,750
there could be several different

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,120
possible

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,959
[Music]

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,399
reference architecture right nowadays

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,480
various vendors have also

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,920
started giving their as a reference

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,040
architecture like

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,560
aws has given one and let's say vmware

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,839
has given one and so on

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,839
right so

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,800
but more or less components will be like

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,800
this only right

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,040
okay now let's see what what is the

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,839
focus of cncf

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,160
or what cncf is doing in this area right

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,360
so

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:55,760
cncf objective is that they want to

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,040
do best utilization of kubernetes

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,399
features

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,639
by telco operators and these developers

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,079
who are working on

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,639
cloud native network function so for

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,720
that

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,320
there is a telecom user group i have

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,240
given the link also if you are

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
interested to join that group or want to

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,639
get more detail

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,200
so there is a telecom user group which

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,200
is doing

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
several things including they have cnf

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,800
test pad also

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,680
and there is a cnf working group

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,600
networking

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,720
spatial interest group right so a lot of

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
activities are happening

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,040
and cnf testbed is a very good

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,880
initiative where

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,079
one can test their cnf on kubernetes

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,079
and they also have openstack based

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,680
environment where they can compare that

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,760
with

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,800
corresponding venus right and do the

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
benchmarking

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,279
in terms of performance and in terms of

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,600
other parameters

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,560
now there are a few projects like

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,079
network

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,199
service mess right which is running

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:04,240
to handle this kind of requirement of

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,760
telcos then there is cuberd project i

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,519
have already covered about

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,399
uh kubert then there is linux foundation

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,600
edge project right this lfh is a

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,720
dedicated project

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,880
for edge computing

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
and there are so many edge stack uh

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,360
related to telcos

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,639
so you can have a look and actually know

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,839
h stack is

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,560
one of the project of lfh

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,880
out of six or seven projects and acronym

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,959
has

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,279
at least 20 different blueprints for

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,839
different electric use cases

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,680
so yeah there is a huge amount of work

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,040
happening

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,760
now in terms of current challenges

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,279
so is kubernetes all geared up and ready

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,160
for dengue

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,600
uh probably not not hundred percent so

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,680
there are some of the challenges which

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,000
are listed here number one bnf hosting

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,199
on kubernetes is still a challenge

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,040
because uh cubert is

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:04,560
uh getting matured at very fast pace

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,800
probably it will be ready in next few

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:10,880
months also but

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,560
right now it is not ready for vnf

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,639
hosting for getting telco great

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,880
performance right so that is one area

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,440
second is multi-cluster management so as

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,399
you know that uh edge deployment will be

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,120
running in thousands

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,839
so we need a multi-cluster management

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,959
solution

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,959
right from where we can have a

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,720
single pane of glass of everything that

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,399
is happening

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:37,839
uh in my let's say hybrid

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,759
multi-edge cloud right there are several

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,199
open source projects which are

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
trying to cover this flow and there are

00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:48,880
vendor-specific

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,000
uh solutions like uh aws has eks

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,040
anywhere

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,360
or google has anthos and then

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,199
azure arc is another solution so yeah i

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,759
mean vendors are

00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,160
uh coming up with such solution i think

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,680
reddit also has advanced cluster

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:07,680
manager acm solution

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:14,480
okay so uh next challenge is

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,160
automated kubernetes cluster provision

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,759
so this is very much required because

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,440
when you are dealing with a

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,160
large scale you need one click

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,040
deployment of not only kubernetes but

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,320
uh all the things which are required

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,440
alongside kubernetes

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,399
right so you need let's say

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,320
uh various operator to be deployed

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,120
automatically which are required

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,920
that's a chef rook operator or something

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,440
else

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,040
so that after that

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,880
your cluster is up and running without

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,320
any manual intervention

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:50,880
so that is required then uh

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,120
another feature which is uh required is

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,759
kubernetes cluster label dr

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,720
now uh what i mean by cluster level dr

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,480
is when

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,920
let's say i am having one kubernetes

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,800
cluster at h type one

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,240
and another cluster at h two and my s

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,720
site goes down

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,919
how do i move all the workload from side

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,679
one to se two

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,199
right so that kind of dr option is

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,799
required

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,640
uh kubernetes as such is not built

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,559
with that kind of architecture in mind

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,919
right it is always single cluster kind

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,760
of architecture

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,760
but we can achieve this kind of uh

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,400
functionality by using various storage

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,799
solution like

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,320
with sync replication async replication

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,039
at the storage layer

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,679
but those are quite challenging to

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,520
implement

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:41,360
right so and migration

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,799
in such cases is not very

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,000
straightforward and easy

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:49,280
even some of the best storage

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,559
uh container native storage vendor

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,440
are still uh figuring out the way to

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,720
provide uh

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,919
seamless migration from one trustworthy

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,640
cluster right okay so the last two

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,880
challenges

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,160
one is enough to cnf conversion is quite

00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,799
challenging

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,559
and deployment complexity is also very

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,880
high

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,520
the key takeaways here telcos are

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,520
becoming software defined earlier they

00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,840
were

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,120
very much applied centric and all and

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,799
not only telcos but

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,840
even the oems are also becoming softer

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,840
different

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,200
and telcos already getting ready for

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,840
playing bigger role

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,799
right and cloud kubernetes open source

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,919
these are

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:39,200
going to be essential technological

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:42,400
components in telco's journey

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,000
right educative applications are also

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,520
being built

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,520
and h native application

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,200
will be built on top of kubernetes and

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,120
uh

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:58,240
so so far we were talking about edge

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,720
edge and kubernetes but kubernetes role

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,919
is not

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,960
limited to edge in fact kubernetes is

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,280
also used

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,280
by leading 5g core vendors

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,520
and they are using it for 5g core and

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,799
various rand vendors are also using

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,919
kubernetes

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,919
for providing uh open ram

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,200
and so on right so kubernetes is coming

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,440
in big way in

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,440
telco landscape so that's a message here

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,880
so with that we have reached a question

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,000
session so if you have any question you

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,120
can

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,120
type it in the chat box and i'll answer

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,679
and if not then we have reached towards

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,520
the end of the session

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,760
so thank you very much for attending

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,760
this

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,280
