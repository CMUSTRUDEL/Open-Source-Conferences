Kubernetes running Manufacturing systems. A perfect match? - Moritz Kröger, RWTH Chair for Lasertechnology

The demand of modern manufacturing machines for better quality inspection and condition monitoring has lead to an increase of sensors and cameras in these systems. Especially in the area of Laser-based manufacturing where a typical machine can produce up to multiple Gigabytes of data per second single manufacturing computers are simply not powerful enough to handle this kind of workload. A research team of the RWTH Chair for Laser technology is currently building a distributed Kubernetes based control system for Laser manufacturing machines. This system not only aggregates the generated data and controls the machine in a distributed environment, but also allows the dynamic injection of data analytics at the edge. This talk gives an overview of the current state of the systems as well as the pros and cons of working with Kubernetes to control manufacturing machines.
