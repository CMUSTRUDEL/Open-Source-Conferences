we're going to talk to craig about his

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,280
career in technology including the

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,559
origins of kubernetes

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,760
we're also going to cover the past

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,039
present and future of all things

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,440
kubernetes and edge

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,640
hey craig how are you doing today i'm

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,840
doing really well matt thanks for having

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,039
me on

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,480
oh yeah this is terrific i've been

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,120
wanting to do this for a long time you

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,120
and i have

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,719
been friends for a while but we've never

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,320
been in a yeah i've never been in an

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,760
environment like this so this is really

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,400
really kind of fun to do this

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,640
um so how did you even get started in

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,880
technology

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,680
um it's funny like i was kind of

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,320
thinking about that and

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,680
i think the answer was the commodore 64

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,560
uh has with so many

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,960
uh kids of my generation um you know as

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
a

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,640
sort of nerdy teenager i discovered that

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,640
programming was

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,000
a great kind of creative outlet for me

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,200
and so i spent most of the years

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,320
from between 10 and 17 i guess coding uh

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,680
and then i took a little break from it

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
believe it or not during college

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,360
um i actually decided to pursue a

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,119
different direction

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,439
uh electrical engineering which in south

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
africa meant like

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,439
real electricity i don't think i'm not

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:44,880
sure that microsoft really understood

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,200
that when they interviewed me but uh

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
and actually do a lot of formal cs

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,479
coursework but um

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
it was close enough that uh enabled me

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,079
to uh get a job at microsoft and

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,640
the rest has been a great journey

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,799
yeah that's that's great and so uh when

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,399
did you leave microsoft and uh go to

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,439
google

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,119
um so i left microsoft uh

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,920
was back in about uh

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,239
roughly 2009 2010 somewhere around there

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,280
and

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,520
uh my first project at google was uh

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,640
i kind of lucked out um there was this

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,879
thing called uh

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,239
well it became google compute engine it

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,680
was called big cluster at the time but

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,920
that's where i met joe beta and

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
uh sort of starting point was really

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
just working on um

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,959
bringing traditional enterprise vms into

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,519
the uh

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,120
into the google data center and it was a

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,400
was a really fun project i learned a lot

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,480
about uh

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,920
what about google's infrastructure a lot

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
about some of the challenges of actually

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,080
bringing those enterprise-grade

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,680
workloads uh

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
into that sort of cloud environment and

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,239
it really set me up

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,120
on the journey that i've been on ever

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
since well and how did how did you go

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
from compute engine

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,920
to kubernetes you know it's interesting

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,920
story um

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,599
you know joe and i you know poured our

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,879
hearts and souls into building compute

00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:00,560
engine and

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,200
we felt like it was great technology you

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,640
know had a really clean elegant api

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,080
um had a lot of very favorable um

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,599
you know performance attributes some

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,080
really interesting networking

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,680
capabilities etc etc but

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,200
it was also kind of interesting because

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
in some ways it was almost too little

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,400
too late

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,519
um you know when we started the project

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,680
um

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,599
uh you know amazon had already opened a

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,239
huge lead in the ecosystem and we were

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,519
starting to see

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,680
a really strong uh convergence of

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,560
um you know isvs and a lot of other

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
organizations

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,360
around that uh around the um the amazon

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,640
ecosystem so

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,319
we step back a little bit and we're

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,680
really thinking about like well what can

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,680
we do to kind of change the

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
change the game some how can we be a

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,840
little disruptive we knew that was going

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,200
to take a while for google to build out

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,560
the strength and the go-to-market

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
side of the house you know get that

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,959
enterprise readiness that it needed to

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,640
really compete which i think they've

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,360
done a fabulous job under

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,200
uh thomas kiran by the way but um but it

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
was also clear that if we didn't do

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,680
something quite disruptive

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
we would you know have a really hard

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,080
time

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,760
competing over time and that really

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
motivated me to

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,319
think outside the box a little bit and

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,040
look at other options

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,799
yeah well you know when we met i was the

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,799
cmo of mesosphere

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,000
and uh what i think is really

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,199
interesting about the

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,880
cncf and kubernetes origin story is

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,479
that you actually embraced these

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,880
alternative technologies

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
can you you tell me a little bit about

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,560
what drove that thinking

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,600
and how that became part of the

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,960
foundational ethos of the cncf

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,960
you know it's it's really interesting

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,800
because um it's funny

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,400
you know i remember this one moment

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,479
where um

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,240
you know joe and i were uh kind of

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,759
working on compute engine

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,240
and it was it was really kind of sad

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,639
because i think the world had an

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,280
opportunity to normalize on something

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
like the

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,160
virtual machine uh image definition as

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
something that could be relatively

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
ubiquitous um

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,560
but that just never happened and i

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
remember turning to joe while we were

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,160
kind of working the project i just had

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,680
this sort of

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,759
like moment where i was like you know

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,919
whoever solves the

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,880
problem associated with packaging and

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,400
deploying

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,960
software atomically kind of like the way

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,039
we do within borg is ultimately going to

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,160
just have this amazing uh sort of you

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,240
know run of it they're going to be able

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,320
to be quite disruptive to the industry

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,600
but we were busy on on compute engine so

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,199
eventually um

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,639
once we got to a point where you know

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,360
compute engine was was

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
uh you know largely um kind of ideated

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,960
and was us on rails

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
we started playing with some ideas and

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
one of the things that immediately

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,919
caught our attention was docker

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,520
it was was funny because i remember um

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,800
you know someone mentioning this to me

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,160
like way way way way

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
back when way before doc was even

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,880
popular like hey you should really be

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,520
paying attention to this it's

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,880
it's kind of a neat model um and when we

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,000
started really getting stuck into it it

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,479
was it was like one of those moments

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,840
where like

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,520
you know wow we shouldn't really have

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,600
thought of this right like it's it was

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,639
such an elegant way to

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,560
you know express a unit of you know um

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,080
deployment um but the thing that was

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,840
most elegant about it wasn't necessarily

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,800
the technology which was you know by

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,960
google's we're thinking

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,080
somewhat uh mundane it was really the

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,680
experience

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
that had been created around that

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,560
recognition that that linux cisco layer

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,400
was um

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
was such a powerful abstraction and that

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
really got the wheels turning you know

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,199
we started thinking about like

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,479
well what would this look like done up

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,160
right and there were certainly some

00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,759
projects in the in the uh

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
in the ecosystem that were interesting

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,319
but more importantly the way that you

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
know my other friend brennan um

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,680
brendan burns who we were working with

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,600
at the time described it as like

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,120
we kind of had the puzzle box when

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
everyone was trying to figure out you

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,440
know how to fit the pieces

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,039
together we'd seen how this would work

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,759
at scale um

00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,880
and that really motivated us to do

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,160
something new and and

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,680
it became obvious that we had to do this

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,759
through the lens of the community you

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,160
know once we just saw or look

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,080
the disproportional level of attention

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,039
and traction and engagement docker was

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,639
receiving

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,400
you know versus the relative maturity of

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,440
the technology it was clear that

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,039
if we could create something righteous

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,479
meaning that had a lot of the

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,560
sensibilities that we've come to take

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,479
for granted at a place like google

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
but we could do it in a way that brought

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,280
the community with us

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,120
we could create something quite special

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,960
and i don't know which of the two

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,599
was that um you know kind of originally

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
you know came up with a crazy idea to uh

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,720
you know to make a run at an open source

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,479
project which became kubernetes it was

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
either brandon or job i i just

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,599
don't remember but they're like hey what

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,080
would it look like to do this and you

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,280
know i

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,360
thought about a bit and we're like yeah

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,919
like let's give it a go and see what

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,000
happens

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,840
and uh you know it definitely worked

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
that okay in the end

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,199
i i think it did i think you know one of

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,000
the things i've really always enjoyed

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,319
about you

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,759
is how methodical you are in your

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,720
strategic planning you know there's

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,479
always some

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,560
game theory equation going on in your

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,039
head and i think that is

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,319
why cncf ended up being the way it is i

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,800
think a large part of it had

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
had to do with just your conviction that

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,680
this was the

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,199
the proper way to uh to change an

00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,000
industry and it certainly has and i

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,160
think we say

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,759
kubernetes has has changed the industry

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,879
and it was continuing to change the

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
industry

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,639
um so so somewhere along the line you

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,199
left google

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,680
um and you co-founded a little company

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,560
called

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
heptio tell us a little bit about about

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
that

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,560
it was really interesting um you know

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,039
while i was at google i was working on

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
um you know so kubernetes was on rails

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,479
and i started to kind of play with some

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,680
other ideas in the space

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,599
uh you know what would the next

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,720
abstraction up look like um

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,639
you know how would we think about

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,360
creating a services ecosystem on top of

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,959
it and

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
i was working on a couple of things

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,120
there uh one of which was the uh apogee

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,440
acquisition and i kind of got friendly

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,880
with

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,800
um with uh chet kapoor who

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,000
who was the kind of founding ceo of

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,519
apogee and

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
he said something to me which kind of

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,279
just stuck in my head you know he was

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,680
like you know to succeed in

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,920
uh to succeed in a startup you really

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,399
need to look for a moment of disruption

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,240
where

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,839
you know the set of incumbents are are

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,880
not able to move as quickly as they

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
might like

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,000
where there's a high uh sort of total

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,120
addressable market

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,760
and uh and you're sort of in a situation

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,959
where

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,880
that's what you can create a successful

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,000
business on and that like it kind of

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,440
clicked for me i was like wow we're

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,160
never going to see

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,519
i'm never going to see these

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:19,279
circumstances again but it was also

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,279
for me um an opportunity to

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
really kind of step back a little bit

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,080
and walk the journey with customers you

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,399
know i

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,839
i'd looked at the sort of circumstance

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
where i was thinking about like well do

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,200
i want to do another kubernetes um

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,800
i was sure that there was another

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,760
kubernetes in that next layer up

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,839
so i thought there would be another

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,519
kubernetes in there somewhere right like

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,720
you know some of the ideas around you

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,160
know that eventually evolved into things

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,680
like service mesh and some of those

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,200
technologies but

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,600
the the really interesting opportunity

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,200
for me personally was the opportunity to

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,519
engage with customers where they were to

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,959
be an effective ambassador for

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,120
this this very rich open source

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,240
community and bridge the gap between

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,839
enterprise organizations that were

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,000
looking to get

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,080
more intrinsically aligned with upstream

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
technology and uh

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,279
and the communities that were supporting

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,079
them and so that that's really what you

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,360
know caused me to

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,079
to to go out and do to hep to you and um

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,760
you know my friend joe was uh he had he

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,200
decided to uh

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,040
retire which was kind of hilarious

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,880
because he loves i remember that

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,160
i didn't believe him when he tried but i

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,279
don't know like and then

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,240
eventually he was like hey when we're

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,839
doing a starter when we're doing a

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,519
startup and i just want to work with joe

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,839
again too i'll be honest like that was

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,519
i've always enjoyed his uh his

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,240
perspective on things and so that that

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,640
really

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,680
motivated us and uh you know that one

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,720
worked out okay too

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
so we're very pleased with um

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
with the traction we made in a

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,320
relatively small amount of time in terms

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,640
of just helping

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,600
some larger uh enterprise organizations

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,040
start to

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,959
make this journey towards cloud-native

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,800
technologies

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,800
what was the most surprising thing that

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,480
you learned on your journey at heptio

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,079
i don't know if this is surprising but

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,160
it's something that i would i certainly

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,720
took to heart as a

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,240
as a leader um when i look back on you

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,120
know what we created and

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,680
the impact that uh the team we brought

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,760
together

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,279
is having within my business unit and

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,040
within vmware is

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,600
you know there's no substitute for

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,640
culture um i think if you can establish

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,040
a

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,480
a very kind of effective cultural bar if

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,079
you can design your culture to the

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,440
problem at hand

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,279
and if you hold yourselves to a very

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,440
high standard you will

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,040
it becomes self-perpetuating um the

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,000
quality of individuals we brought in

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,680
um have just done tremendous work you

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
know within the parameters the community

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,040
within the parameters of vmware and i

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,959
couldn't be more proud of just the

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,240
people like it's it's

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,000
uh and i think that really just started

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,320
with being very very deliberate about

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,880
the culture we're creating

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,160
what were the pillars of the culture

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,399
it's funny you asked that um

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,000
there were there were kind of three sort

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:51,760
of pillars of the culture that

00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,519
um uh that we established the first was

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,200
what i used to say was honest technology

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,800
um you know we are a organization that

00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,920
is in service of the community and in

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,519
service of our customers

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,160
and what we build is honest technology

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,560
so you know we stand behind the way that

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
we

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,480
build we stand behind what we build we

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,600
take a great degree of of pride and

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,000
delight in creating honest technology

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
um the second kind of you know cultural

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,760
element

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,800
that um you know i used to push a lot

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,120
was carry the fire

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,720
like a real passion for disruption an

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
authentic desire to create something

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,959
that was bigger than

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
than anyone had seen and this this

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,839
willingness to

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
do the hard thing to walk the hard road

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
when you have to

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,600
um and then the third element that we we

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
put a lot of of emphasis on was we

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,760
before me

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,040
um the idea that um you know it's it's

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,800
uh it's about the quality of the

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,639
the the team it's about the quality of

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,639
the community it's about

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,160
um doing that little bit of extra work

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,200
so that someone else doesn't have to do

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,920
it tomorrow

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,519
um and obviously the there's a ocean of

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
nuance associated with each of those

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
three

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,000
uh those three elements but just having

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,120
that anchor of

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,279
um a culture that was really um

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,880
understandable and manifest every day it

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,760
informed the decisions that we made and

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,760
informed

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,200
who we hired informed how we interviewed

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
and i think that really set us up for

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
success

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,279
yeah and uh for for um for those who

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,880
don't know

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,680
and probably two people in the audience

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,959
haptio was acquired by vmware

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,480
and uh you know back when when you and i

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,040
were working closely together

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
uh we we used to get the question right

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,880
vms or containers

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,079
like which is gonna win and uh i think

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,040
we knew uh

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,040
that the answer was yes um and now i

00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
think definitively it's yes but can you

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,040
tell me a little bit

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,199
how heptio and i guess more importantly

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,480
to the kubernetes community kubernetes

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,519
has been integrated into vmware

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,040
and uh what is the vmware tanzu grid i

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,000
believe is the product

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,480
navigator yeah you know it's interesting

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,079
because

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:03,120
um you know i see containers

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,000
and vms as being um

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,839
they're fundamentally different

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
technologies one solves a packaging and

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,920
distribution problem the other solves a

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,839
uh a hardware isolation and abstraction

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,560
problem and we're certainly seeing

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,000
uh often as not a kind of yes and art

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,880
series of outcomes i think you know

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,760
almost every

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,480
vendor now has some form of hypervisor

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,040
isolated

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,399
um you know kubernetes uh or container

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,760
abstraction and we're certainly no

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,199
exception to that

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,560
um you know for me when pat approached

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,160
us um

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,240
and we certainly weren't looking to sell

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,320
i i you know like we were we're doing

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,839
great we're having a lot of fun but it

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,760
was also clear that to have

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,680
the impact that i wanted to have on the

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,839
industry we we did need a bigger boat

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,440
it's like that scene from jaws where you

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,120
seize the size of the opportunity see

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,079
the size the impact you can have and you

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,399
you need that bigger boat right and um

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,160
and

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,639
what i was you know so excited about was

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,160
the opportunity to

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,680
use the strengths that vmware was

00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,600
bringing to the table um

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,199
you know that incredibly trusted brand

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,480
in enterprise computing and awareness of

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,639
how to actually

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
operationalize at scale uh and

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,120
understanding that you know the first 80

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,720
percent

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,160
of the work is is you know only you know

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
getting to that eighty percent point is

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,040
only 20 of the effort right like that

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,720
last 20

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,079
of of enterprise technology is really

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,760
hard there's just an ordinary amount of

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,199
effort associated with

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,120
dealing with the edge cases and getting

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,279
everything set up and

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,720
you know to me i saw this uh this

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,320
impeccable opportunity

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,040
to you know be a part of vmware becoming

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,120
something

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,800
more than just a virtualization company

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,600
obviously vmware already was well done

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,959
the franchise

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,040
road i had a lot of different um kind of

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,040
you know businesses but

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,160
being in a position where we could build

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,440
out what i thought of as being a

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
legitimate meta cloud

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,120
you know something that would make

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,199
on-premises public cloud and

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,560
increasingly the network edge look

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,320
consistent um

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,639
was it just you know incredibly exciting

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,399
to me and so as i've been on this

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,160
uh on this journey you know i always

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,600
think of you know the kind of in my head

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,320
i'm pretty simplistic you know

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,000
one i want to deliver a ubiquitous

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,720
kubernetes substrate that's consistent

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
everywhere two that's not really

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,759
interesting unless you have an effective

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
control plane to manage it

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,839
and then three i want to render up uh

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
the software supply chain

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,360
that enables developers to produce

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,240
business outcomes in that destination

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,560
and

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,920
um you know through the initial you know

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,040
integration into

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,959
um vmware we just massively extended our

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,040
reach to all of those existing

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,320
uh facilities and became a really strong

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,959
anchor for vmware's

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,639
own navigation and migration to support

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,639
public cloud computing

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,920
um and then you know from a futures

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,079
perspective you know it's all about the

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,040
edge like that this is where

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,639
i see the most uh excitement you know

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,399
for me personally

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839
i think it's going to be a huge growth

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,160
area and a highly disruptive

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,759
um area of innovation you know the

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,360
coming years and i just can't be

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,680
couldn't be happier to be a part of that

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,120
journey at a company like vmware

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,320
well i'm glad you you brought up edge

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
because i was about to transition to

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,959
that since this is the

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,480
the the edge day um so so when you say

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
the opportunity at edge

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
and i won't make you define edge but i

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,720
want to see what what are the

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:16,000
opportunities you see for kubernetes

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,520
well i mean the whole point of

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,799
kubernetes was that it would be that

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,480
goldilocks abstraction

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,000
that enables you to treat um you know

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,880
most infrastructure

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,760
consistently and the opportunity here is

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,919
is no different

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,440
um you know i think you know obviously

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,320
there's a very broad

00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,760
you know array of definitions for you

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,039
know what edge computing is from you

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,960
know thick edge to

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,039
thin edge near edge far edge however you

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,600
want to kind of uh

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,960
taxonomize it and so the starting point

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,520
i think is just having that normalized

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,640
substrate like um that compute substrate

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
that you can then

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,919
tie back to a control plane so you can

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,280
start to reason about

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,200
your edge whether it's you know

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,559
geographically distributed whether it's

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,480
running in a variety of different

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,600
you know polities whatever the case may

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,080
be

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,039
as being a common destination and making

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,799
that destination

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,320
accessible to developers that are

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:09,760
building physical outcomes

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:11,520
is really interesting we've seen so much

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,799
excitement and engagement around things

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,559
like reactive

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,320
computing patterns we've seen the

00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,840
emergence of you know cdn based

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,600
capabilities

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,120
that's really addressing the kind of

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,679
outward flow of of

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,799
developer assets you know to the edge

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,559
device

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,480
the really exciting thing is what about

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,000
the reverse like how do we start to kind

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,520
of synthesize and process information

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
that's being generated at the edge

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,640
how do we do that in a topology aware

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,400
way

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,880
that's making appropriate use of what

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,840
computational resources home they're

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,280
you know balancing computational

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,320
consumption with network

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,400
um backbone consumption um

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,440
and that to me is just i could not be

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,320
more excited about the

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
the opportunity to to to look to

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,160
participate in

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,960
in that part of the so journey me unpack

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,919
that a little bit

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,720
so um if you think about you know

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,360
kubernetes as being a

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,559
over simplistically but uh i think

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,200
usefully a

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,240
a platform that will take a container

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,679
and based on

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,039
a declaration run it somewhere and um

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,600
in a single data center um there's a set

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,280
of

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,799
you know common declarations that we

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,080
might make that the

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,520
scheduler can interpret to figure out

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,320
where those workloads run within that

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,960
cluster

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,160
in that data center do you see that

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,360
metaphor

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,360
uh translating you know the ten thousand

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,480
or the ten thousand servers in my my

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,160
single data center

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
that different from the ten thousand

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,679
servers in the

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,120
you know 500 data centers that are that

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,880
i might be using at the edge

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,559
is do those metaphors translate you

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
think i think they do to a certain

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,559
extent but you have to recognize

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,160
that it's it this sort of added

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,320
complexity to the problem

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,000
right so the the interesting challenge

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,120
with uh with edge is

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,400
um you know one is

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,559
you're just dealing with a scale of

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,720
operations within within the logical

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,360
construct of a data center

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,400
you can afford to have an operating

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,080
model that

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,840
that scales you know somewhat linearly

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,080
with the number of uh

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,120
you know potential clusters or you pick

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,840
your poison

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,799
um as you start looking at edge it

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,240
changes the dynamics you have to have

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,080
something that scales you know pretty

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,760
much you know like

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,200
just the the cost of operations just

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,520
doesn't scale with the uh

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,600
the deployment topology otherwise things

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,080
are going to get bad you can't send

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,360
uh an it operator to every edge location

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,720
to deal with something that you have to

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,679
update whereas you could do that in the

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,159
old days

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,200
and kubernetes is is just an incredibly

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,400
important technology from that

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,480
perspective

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,919
it introduces a determinism in terms of

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,159
how you can reason above

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,440
deploying something so you can take that

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,760
package software and run it very much

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,760
like you could in a data center

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,880
but the thing that's really elegant

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,400
about kubernetes isn't

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,679
just about like oh i can make placement

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,880
decisions about virtual machine

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,679
instances

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,159
kubernetes has created a a controller

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,600
patent

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,840
like you know brennan burns one of the

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,600
founders of the project so is a

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,360
creative genius as far as i'm concerned

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,960
he's also a robotics professor

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,880
um before this and so he was all geeking

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,080
out about you know kind of control

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,320
uh theory and that certainly is a key

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,200
element of what kubernetes is it's it's

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,039
not just about

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
containers and deployment it's about

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,320
creating an appropriate set of control

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,280
loops so that what's within the

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,159
boundaries of that

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,080
that controller um can be managed at

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,120
atomically by that controller so it's

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,559
it's not just about getting your

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,559
application out there it's about the

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,039
care and feeding if something goes wrong

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,120
uh the restart dynamics the ability to

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,520
deterministically update it

00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,799
making informed decisions about uh you

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,799
know scalability

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,400
in those in those locations without

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,240
access to

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,520
a centralized control plane perhaps in

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,799
some situations

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,080
um they certainly work with a lot of

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,280
organizations where you know some of

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,640
those environments are periscoping in

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,080
their behavior they might be

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,919
lte connected and there might be a

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,360
network outage or um

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,679
they might be on a cruise ship that

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,280
sells out to see every you know x months

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,960
and it's just not connected at all

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,760
and kubernetes lends itself so well to

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,280
that um because it's not just about

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,799
you know delivering static technology

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,480
it's about delivering

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,799
wealth or through controllers that can

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,280
deal with a lot of those parameters if

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,400
you can

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,000
you know if you can think about it you

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,960
can program it and you can you know push

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,320
into kubernetes

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,760
and not just at the infrastructure level

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,799
but increasingly the application level

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,000
as well

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,799
so i think that's going to be uh

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,080
incredibly powerful

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,120
so when you think about the edge you

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,320
know there there are some pretty

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,039
fundamental

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,000
changes that happen at the access

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,400
network that last

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,240
mile so to speak um you know a lot of

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,039
times the ownership of the server

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,480
transfers from a cloud company to an

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,600
enterprise you know

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,720
um how do you see

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,400
um how do you view that the

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,600
the that transition the edge of the last

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,280
mile mark network do you see that

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,360
getting blurrier do you

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,559
do you imagine uh you know uh

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,360
cloud workloads being spawned on private

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,880
equipment i mean

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,880
how do you how do you view that i think

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,640
it's a it's a fascinating uh it's a

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,960
fascinating topic of discussion and

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,240
like if i i think anyone who tells you

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,880
they know exactly how it's going to go

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
is probably

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,640
selling something i think there's

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,440
there's still a lot of figuring out to

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,559
do but

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,559
you know i'd say there are a couple of

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,039
trends we will see the cloud providers

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,280
come

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,280
with deeply vertically integrated

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,039
capabilities that are being

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,240
rendered out into uh into those

00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,200
environments and they have some very

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:29,360
strong assets at their disposal

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,919
i think we will certainly see some

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,000
amazing opportunities for

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,919
organizations to create kind of

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
multi-tenant-based outcomes in those

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,919
types of destinations so

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,600
independently of who owns a physical

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,039
piece of serving gear

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,240
there's no reason why you couldn't

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,240
create an api economy or a

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,600
an edge function economy that can

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,559
leverage out you know whoever

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,840
you know put that piece of

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,600
infrastructure up there as long as you

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,520
can normalize that infrastructure

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,279
as long as you can set up the the

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,400
tenancy model and the

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,240
the isolation boundaries sufficiently um

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
you're in a situation where there's like

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,200
whole new economies will likely emerge

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,760
around this

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,520
um and i think that that landscape will

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:12,320
be quite fluid for some time

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,000
um but yeah it's it's certainly it's a

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,960
fascinating dynamic exactly as you said

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
as you

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,880
you know there's these sort of classic

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:21,840
boundaries of of ownership and

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,279
that's very much in flux at the moment

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,360
yeah i mean it's it's uh

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,640
uh you know you can run kubernetes on a

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,360
on a raspberry pi

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,480
on a device that's actually in the field

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,000
and i think it's very different than

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,720
running kubernetes

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,679
on a uh you know on a server that

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,919
happens to be

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,799
at the base for cell tower in a carrier

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,679
hotel or

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,320
in a regional data center um but i think

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,360
both are

00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,799
reasonable and applicable

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,080
yeah i do think so and it's interesting

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,159
because there's a there's a decent

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,159
analog here to linux if you think about

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,679
the form factors that linux is is

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,760
deployed into linux is deployed into

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,720
everything from

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:00,080
cell phone size devices to mainframes

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,640
and everything in between

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,640
um and if you think about what

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,400
kubernetes is emerging is

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:10,080
it's effectively a it's a way to program

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,120
distributed systems patents it's a way

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,320
to kind of deliver

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,799
distributed systems patents and um and i

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,360
think the

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,080
the analog is is pretty is pretty clear

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,080
um

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,200
i don't you know i think kubernetes

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,400
complements linux

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,240
um i'm not sufficiently arrogant to

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,640
like assume that it will have the duty

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,440
cycle that linux has had i hope it does

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,799
i think it likely will but we still have

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,679
work to do as a community to make that

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,880
true

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,200
um but the the potential of the sort of

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,279
the versatility of that model i think is

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,799
is quite strong and uh we're certainly

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,039
heading in in a positive direction with

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:48,320
technology

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,520
if you could um provide the the audience

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,559
of developers

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,159
some direction on where you would like

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,600
to see the community invest

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,760
in kubernetes to uh exploit some of the

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,279
new opportunities at edge what what

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,480
would you what would you advise them to

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,000
do

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,600
you know it's interesting i was thinking

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,760
a little bit about this before

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,520
uh before we came on i think there's

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,360
there's obviously

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,640
you know normalizing a variety of

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,880
different form factors

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,159
um making sure that we have effective

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,360
conformance standards

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,440
around a variety of different form

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,919
factors effectively making sure that we

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,559
get

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:24,000
those profiles in place so that you know

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,679
if you're building an application for a

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
certain class of deployment

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
there's a well-qualified um you know

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
profile because

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:31,520
you know when you're running something

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,279
on raspberry pi it's not going to feel

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,679
like running something in your in your

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,440
mainstream data center so um i think

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,520
that's certainly an area that

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,880
you know behooves us to to emphasize and

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,400
focus on

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,720
you know interestingly i've been

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,919
thinking a fair bit uh recently about

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,919
um the intersection of web assembly and

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,720
and some of these technologies um you

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:51,679
know there's an interesting little

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,960
project from

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,679
microsoft called crusted but

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,520
when we start looking at uh the class

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,960
and shape and nature of

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:04,880
um of like things like edge functions

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,559
the ability to write a relatively small

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,840
slit of code that can run in a massively

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,880
multi-tenant

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,919
context uh have very high levels of

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,320
of uh security isolation it really

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,399
starts to feel a lot like webassembly

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,399
and so i'd love to see things like the

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,840
webassembly um

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,360
systems interfaces protocols uh solidify

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,640
i think that could become quite

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,200
interesting in this world and it's

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,360
obviously very early days but um

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,799
that's something i'd love to see us us

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,279
think about and you know

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,640
and then like really tooling up the uh

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,840
the developer experience around some of

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,760
those pieces would be

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,200
quite interesting just enabling folks to

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,919
start thinking about building

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,640
um you know building applications for

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,240
these these types of deployments where

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,640
various pieces are home to a variety of

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,880
different destinations depending on the

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,240
the the cost economics of where

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,120
something is run is is going to be quite

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,720
interesting

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,240
um and again it's all going to come back

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,960
to control plane um you're not going to

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:04,000
be a cool vendor if you don't have a

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,840
a control plane that enables you to

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,039
deliver outcomes into these types of

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,760
destinations

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,159
um at the end of the day relatively few

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,720
organizations are going to have the

00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,039
capabilities to you know operate

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,679
effectively a full-on sas service

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,279
to to you know think through the

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,720
mechanics of how

00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:25,279
these types of applications are built

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,320
and delivered and uh managed and updated

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,240
and observed

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,600
that's going to be interesting um and

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,080
then the final piece i think that's

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,320
going to be

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,360
quite interesting and this is something

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,919
i don't think

00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,120
the community is is focused quite enough

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,200
on yet but it's certainly an area that

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,240
we're focused on within vmware which is

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
observability um becomes really

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,440
interesting

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,039
when you're dealing with something and

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,679
really important like

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,360
you know what what does it look like you

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,720
know what does apm look like

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,600
for an edge-based um solution

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,960
where you have you know a pretty you

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,240
know a pretty fragment or pretty

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,520
hierarchical topology

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,279
um how do you reason about uh you know a

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,799
metric system that's

00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,880
um thinking about how do you make that

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,159
sufficiently hierarchical so that you

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,600
don't overwhelm

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,799
the network links with metrics but

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,159
you're able to retain what you need to

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,120
retain from a local deployment

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,880
perspective

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,320
um so that's going to be an area of you

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,279
know certainly significant emphasis for

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,279
us and i think an

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,520
area that the community would do well to

00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,240
pay attention to

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,080
yeah i think the the the whole telemetry

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,760
the importance of telemetry to edge

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,679
computing has been

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,120
uh underappreciated and it's not just

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,799
telemetry come off coming off the

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,440
applications it's telemetry coming off

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,279
the network

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,720
it's kind of actually coming off of the

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,440
operational technology

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,320
i mean if one of your micro data centers

00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,640
out at the edge

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,240
goes on to battery power you probably

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
want to make some intelligent decisions

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,640
about starting up

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,799
you know backup workload somewhere and

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,480
starting to low balance traffic around

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,320
and right now getting that information

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,960
is very hard because it's not something

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,720
that

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,480
you know it's it's probably buried

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,840
behind some can bus interface that you

00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,720
don't have access to as a software

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,159
developer

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,520
uh and even you did you might not know

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,799
what to do with it so it's it's the

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,200
telemetry piece i think you're right

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,240
that's

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,799
really really underappreciated um from

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,080
the

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:15,679
the from a use case perspective um

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,360
and i you know i it's you know the the

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,039
you know the autonomous car example is

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,080
the one that wants to be everybody's

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,360
favorite although

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,120
i think people that really think about

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,840
it don't expect the infrastructure to be

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,919
the driving

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,120
factor for autonomous vehicles maybe for

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:29,039
coordinating them but not

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,159
not the thing but if you look like over

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,960
the next

00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,960
let's say 18 months like what what what

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,320
are the use cases that you think are

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,640
realistically going to emerge that

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,360
excite you

00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,320
the two areas where i see the most kind

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,360
of

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,720
energy around are in the

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,399
retail and manufacturing segments

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,000
look pretty much every segment you can

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,640
think of is uh is

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,000
is is chewing on the edge problem um

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,399
retail in particular

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
um is an area where i'm seeing things

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:02,559
moving very very quickly

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,440
um you know obviously the the global

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,320
pandemic

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,919
has forced a lot of retailers to you

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,279
know take a long hard look at how they

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,720
do business how they operate

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:15,600
and you know the um

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,080
you know the old um narrative around

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,159
necessity and invention um

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,519
it's uh we're seeing so much traction

00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,240
there so

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,720
getting um getting to a point where we

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,240
have

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,880
far more you know computational resource

00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,000
in

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,720
in a form factor that is appropriate

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
for the destination that is you know

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,760
sufficiently operable

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,200
that you can roll it out to a pretty

00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,679
broad array of sites

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,679
to unlock everything from you know

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,080
relatively simple

00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,880
uh you know experiences in uh you know

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,679
small

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,880
you know branch locations or uh small

00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,159
retail locations to

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,159
running you know really high-end

00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,000
inferencing workloads and

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,360
uh you know you know creating these next

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,919
generation um

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,880
shopping experiences um is interesting

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,240
this

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,919
that that segment in particular is

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,519
moving very quickly um

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,039
manufacturing i think over a slightly

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,600
longer horizon is

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,640
is becoming you know very very focused

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,559
on

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,840
getting better computational resource

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:15,200
and you know a better control of the

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:16,559
computational resource but

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,000
the problem with a lot of manufacturing

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,399
is that that's generally tied to a

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,760
pretty high capex moment and it's a it's

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,799
a sort of much more

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,000
kind of complex um roll-up but um you

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,279
know certainly from what i see well you

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,679
mentioned covert 19

00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,519
and you know my experience is that you

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,120
know every every manufacturer had a

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,880
10-year automation plan that's now a

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,960
four-year automation plan

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,080
because of covet because nobody wants

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,440
stuck in that position again where

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,440
they're shutting down the lines because

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,799
they can't get people close enough

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:48,960
yeah really really interesting times um

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:50,559
so craig the um uh

00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,039
what do you think the the biggest

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:56,240
challenges are to adoption of

00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,320
edge devices and edge technology

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,399
it always comes back to the people

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,880
skills um you know the technology i

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,760
think is

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,360
is emerging being able to identify you

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,640
know just given the noise being able to

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,440
steal a signal from the noise

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,080
and uh you know make smart bets um you

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,000
know getting

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,760
the the skill set in place that's

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,760
necessary to

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,120
uh you know start running a series of

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,440
experiments um

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,880
you know navigating so that you're not

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,480
making these kind of huge

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,679
you know capex heavy investments that

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,960
you can actually start to build into

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,279
what you're doing

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,799
um and and build your organizational

00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,519
skills at the same rate as you're

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,679
starting to

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,360
to engage and deploy these technologies

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,640
is is key

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,799
um the control plane you have to have a

00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,039
[Music]

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,000
a sort of a hierarchical highly

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,640
available

00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,799
um control plan to support this um

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,240
that's necessary because

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,320
it's not just about you know i think a

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,159
lot of folks you know overemphasize well

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,760
what does it take to deploy a kubernetes

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,519
to this destination well it's

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,559
that's one thing updating it that's

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,120
another but then like how do i deploy

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,840
an application into 10 000 retail

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,240
locations

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,600
how do i run an experiment in two of

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,399
those and get the results of that

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,919
experiment

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,560
how to make informed decision when i'm

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,599
ready to deploy that update out to

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,599
the other 9998 locations if you're

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
running a sufficiently large operation

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,839
um and you know without that control

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,280
plane technology getting really

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,320
buttoned down and being able to reason

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,760
about the control plane is something

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,440
that spans both

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,679
the infrastructure but also the supply

00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,599
chain that renders those application

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,359
capabilities components experiences is

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,119
going to be uh key

00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,960
and i'd say this the second area then

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,599
this is you know as we start looking at

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,720
you know

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,720
the the energy and impetus to

00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,960
start to have more multi-tenant

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:43,520
edge-based facilities is going to be

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,879
a challenge the kubernetes itself was

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,720
certainly never built as

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,240
a kind of natively multi-tenant

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,399
um uh environment so being able to have

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:58,320
better lines of isolation

00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,800
um uh security a tendency model that's

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,320
that's that's smart for much lighter

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,160
weight um kind of

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,240
function like use cases it's going to be

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,200
a big a big challenge for this

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:10,000
this industry sounds like a lot of

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,880
exciting work

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,000
to get done craig thank you thank you

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,560
