it's like to be a maintainer

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,400
we'll spend the first half of the day

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,520
going over the um

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,280
sorry for those of you who are

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,159
interested in becoming a maintainer

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,000
we'll spend

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
um the second half of the day going over

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,759
at the main structure

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
and um before we get started though just

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,320
a few housekeeping items

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,439
um first this event is going to be

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,920
recorded so

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,080
um as you can see we are recording and

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,119
the recording will be made available

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,759
um on the cncf youtube channel

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,439
um later this week hopefully um so

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,159
you'll be able to catch up on everything

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,960
if you don't um catch it the first time

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,280
and then for

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,560
q a we will not be using the q a

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,240
function on bevvy

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,119
um instead uh we have a channel

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,159
on the cncf slack it's going to be the

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,200
home contributor

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,520
summit 2021 um slack channel so it's

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,320
pretty obvious on the cncf slack

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,719
and i will share a link to that later if

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,640

stay organized and our maintainers will

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,640

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,080

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,239
all right all right thank you all for

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
joining us today this is our first ever

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,000
helm contributor summit uh we've done

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
helm summits in the past that have been

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,879
more organized around

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,920
uh the run in and around the community

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:07,760
on helm itself

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,760
and this time we wanted to take the

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
opportunity to talk more about the whole

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,319
process of

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,480
contributing governance and things like

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,440
that so i'm going to go through a very

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,680
quick slide deck to give you an overview

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,519
to learn about today and then i will

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,360
pass it on to many of the different helm

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,959
core maintainers along many different

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,040
parts of the org and you'll uh

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,959
learn a lot from them about how each one

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,200
kind of does their particular

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,560
thing and how you can get involved and

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
begin contributing to help

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,280
so i'm going to kick off with kind of a

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
big overview to just clear up

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,560
some of the terminology we use about how

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,480
helmets govern so helm is a cncf project

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,239
uh cloud native computing foundation is

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,239
a non-profit that's part of the linux

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,159
foundation that basically serves as sort

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,319
of a central body where we can all

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,920
uh donate uh open source software and

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,480
have it sort of governed under a central

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,120
model

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,400
so underneath the cncf helm has an

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,239
organization

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,159
and the helm org has many different

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,360
projects uh but they're all

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,319
tightly related to to helm itself and uh

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,760
so to keep

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,599
all of those projects working well

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,280
together we have one central org and the

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,880
helm community repo

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
is where you can find out more about

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,959
this org underneath the org there are a

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,560
whole bunch of different projects one of

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,160
which is the helm project

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,720
and that's the project that works on the

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,240
piece of software that we call helm

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,840
but there are several other different

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
projects in the helm org too

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,040
uh including documentation some of the

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,280
github

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,080
uh actions um uh registry and repository

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,080
tools

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
and uh several more that you'll hear

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,680
about throughout the day but a lot of

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
the

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
focus today is going to be on both the

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,040
helm core project

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,400
uh the helm project and the helm

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,320
documentation project

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,160
we will however cover a number of these

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
other things

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,639
so i wanted to allow it a couple of

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,639
terms because you're going to hear us

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,120
talk about them throughout the day

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,000
so we talk about project maintainers

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,240
every helm

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
repository every piece of the helm

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
organization

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,720
has some people who act as core

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
maintainers

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,000
and core maintainers are responsible for

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,160
taking care of that

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,919
project you'll hear us go into more

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,840
detail about that over the day

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,400
but a project maintainer is really

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,240
related to just one of those projects

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,600
you might also hear us talk about the

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,919
security team

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,039
the security team is a cross project

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,479
team so we've got

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,479
some core maintainers from many

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,560
different uh helm projects

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
that we all work together to triage

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,199
security issues when a new thing comes

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,120
in

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,160
and we're the ones who try and roll out

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,000
the security updates when necessary

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
you'll also hear us talk about org

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,120
maintainers

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,720
so all the projects are grouped together

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
under the big helm org

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,840
the helm org itself has some people that

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
are nominated from

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,639
projects to represent uh those projects

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,960
to the org itself and we'll talk about

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,479
that

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,880
in particular i'll be talking about that

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,199
late this uh later on today uh in the

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,360
second half of today's presentations

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
and then the last uh term that you may

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,639
hear uh today that

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,520
that i wanted you to be aware of is

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,680
emeritus maintainers so in academia

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,600
you hear about a professor who retires

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
they become an emeritus professor

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,880
which means they no longer have teaching

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
or committee responsibilities at the

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,319
university right

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,479
we wanted to borrow that same concept

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,160
and when people um retire their

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,440
maintainer ships whether they're project

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
or org maintainers

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
we then refer to them as emeritus

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800
maintainers uh

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,840
just as a as a way of showing respect

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,840
for people who have

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,280
contributed uh many hours of work to the

00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,600
project

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,440
uh okay so now we're going to dive in a

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,800
little bit to sort of an overview of how

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,120
helmet self changes

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,160
all of development of helm takes place

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,240
on github

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,000
okay we do chat in slack and in other uh

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759
other places we you know we we do some

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,680
live dev updates

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,880
but the development itself happens on

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,639
github

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,400
so when i use these terms this is kind

00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
of what we're all we all use the same

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,919
terms together

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,720
issues right an issue is a github issue

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,720
that

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,160
is a bug or a request for help or

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
something like that

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
when we talk about changing the helm

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:14,319
repo we talk about pull requests or prs

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,080
uh prs are ways uh using git's api to

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,000
submit patches uh

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
to a project in a sort of controlled way

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,599
where we can review them

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
so if you head over to github and you

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,160
interact with pretty much any of the

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
open source projects you'll see some

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,199
combination of issues and pull requests

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,120
used

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,680
but one thing that's more helm specific

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,360
is helm improvement proposals or hips

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,120
that's actually borrowed from python

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
improvement of improvement proposals

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,199
which are pips

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,199
but a hip is a way for us to track a

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,360
formal definition of a feature

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,639
that we want to add in to helm and it

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,720
gives us an extra

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,160
review milestone for adding features and

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
we'll talk about that i'll i'll talk

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,440
about it briefly once more

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
now but you'll hear about it in more

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,520
detail later on today

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,199
um and and while i do say that hips are

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,400
to track features every once in a while

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,080
we do put in small

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,080
small features in helm without having

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,680
them go through the hip proposal process

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,720
and i wanted to say that upfront lest

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,639
anybody uh panic at what i'm saying

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,720
so the last kind of big thing i wanted

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,960
to go through before handing it over to

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,639
uh to my co-presenters is i wanted to

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,199
talk through some of the workflows that

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,199
you connect

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,639
that you'll hear a lot about today so

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,039
github again is our

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,720
central place of doing development and

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,319
there are particular established

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,400
workflows

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,240
in github that we use and some of them

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
are the way you've seen them on other

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
projects and others are a little

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,560
different so i wanted to start out with

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:37,120
the documentation workflow

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,080
so we have github.com helmslash helmw

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,760
and that's where documentation is if you

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,000
want to change the documentation that

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,080
you see on

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,959
helm.sh you go to this repo

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,880
and you file an issue saying hey here's

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,200
a problem with the documentation

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,720
somebody writes the text to address that

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
change a new pr

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,480
is open right a pull request that has

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,080
just those changes

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,920
and then we discuss those changes and

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
make sure that you know it's organized

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,800
it's clear

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,160
it's grammatically correct it's helpful

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,560
to the end user

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,600
and uh you know we on occasion we go

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,760
back and forth right

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,279
and and the person who submits the pr

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,720
has to make a couple changes then we

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,880
review it again and say okay everything

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,720
looks good and we approve it

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,120
then that pr gets merged into the

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,959
mainline uh repository

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,720
and at some point that mainline gets

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,760
republished and your documentation

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
changes will show up

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,839
on the site so that's sort of the

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,399
typical workflow right start with an

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,320
issue

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,839
do a little bit of discussion go to a

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
pull request do a little bit of

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
discussion on whether the pull request

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,800
satisfies the issue

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
and then if it does we approve it and it

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,160
goes on to get published

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,839
a very similar workflow exists for bugs

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,920
and uh i think it's adam maurice we'll

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,720
be talking about this uh

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
in a couple hours from now uh somebody

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,560
files an issue and says this doesn't

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
seem to be right about helm

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,920
and there's some discussion well how do

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,920
we reproduce it can we identify the

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,120
cause what are some possible solutions

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,320
and we discussed there in the issue

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,160
queue many of you i know have

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,079
participated in this process

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,480
for which i am very thankful and at some

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,480
point someone says okay i will

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,920
i will try and fix this and they write

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,040
some code uh

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,200
open a pull request and um and

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,200
and we start to discuss that pull

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
request and we say okay

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,720
are there unit tests to make sure this

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,279
works does the code pass all of our

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,440
quality

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,120
metrics is it functioning properly are

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,600
there any security issues inadvertently

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,200
caused by this particular change and

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,760
again we might go back and forth a

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,399
little bit

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,800
uh with the author and the reviewers and

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,360
uh

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,480
often the community as well but the goal

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,040
is to get that

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
patch all all shaped up and then merged

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
into the main line again

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,320
so two maintainers have to sign off and

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,279
say okay this looks good to me

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,959
uh and and then at that point it gets

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:55,120
merged onto the main branch

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,040
and we wait for a little while and uh

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,399
when we cut our releases which are all

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
done on a timeline

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,000
then that patch will go in there um

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,680
we will cover the coding part a little

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
bit later this morning i believe martin

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
hickey is going to take

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
care of that and talk about that in more

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,680
detail i'm just trying to give a quick

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,040
overview of it now

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,040
so here's the last thing i wanted to

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,959
give a quick overview of

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,760
and this is the feature workflow so this

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:22,560
is slightly different and for a reason

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,320
we value helm stability very very highly

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,800
right now we know that there are we got

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,440
five plus million downloads of helm per

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,959
month

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
and so we know there are a lot of people

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,279
relying on helm to function properly

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,640
introducing a feature can be dangerous

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,720
because it might break something

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,200
inadvertently or it might modify the way

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,279
people do work in an unexpected way

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,720
so we are very careful when we introduce

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,240
new features

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
that's why we have helm improvement

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,680
proposals which is a written description

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,360
of what your feature is going to do and

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,920
how it's going to work

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,680
so a hip is created in the community

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,800
repository not in the helmhelm

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,480
repository

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,240
and can refer to any of the projects

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,160
under helm and

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,600
again matt fisher will go over this in

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,680
detail later but

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,800
the idea is it's a written explanation

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,720
of the feature

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,160
we discuss that feature a little more

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
carefully than we discuss

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,600
discuss a bug fix and we say okay does

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,200
it is it addressing the problem is it

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
consistent with the rest of the way

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,160
homeworks

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,920
um does it break anything does it

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,600
introduce any new security issues are

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,440
there other things we need to consider

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,040
would it be better to wait until helm4

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,360
to do this kind of change and things

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,760
like things of that nature

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,959
a successful hip will get approved and

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,600
then

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,399
merged into the community repository and

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,240
then

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,240
oftentimes the pr will start during the

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
course of the hip but at that point

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,079
once the hip is approved then we will

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
the maintainers will officially consider

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,480
whether we are going to merge the pr

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,560
as well and the pr review turns over to

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,560
are the mechanics of the code correct

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,079
uh is it are there unit tests are there

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,480
functional tests is the hip

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,160
properly implemented in this pr and

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,320
things like that and again

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
uh we'll iterate a little bit back and

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,279
forth but before the

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,040
two main two or more maintainers approve

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,320
of that and it gets merged in now

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,399
features don't go out in

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,760
every release they only go out in minor

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,399
or major releases

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,440
so they're far less frequent in the code

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,440
base than

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,600
patching and security fixes which will

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,120
go in every single release

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,120
so that should give you a big overview

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
again we're going to come back later and

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,320
cover each of those things

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,839
in more detail but i wanted to give a

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,880
sort of bird's eye view

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,279
of how we look at maintaining health

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
so next up scott rigby is going to jump

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,240
in here and talk about repositories i

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,959
haven't talked really much about those

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,200
at all

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,279
uh i'm waiting to pass everything on to

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,880
him and he'll give an introduction of

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,480
that and the changes in the last year

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,320
and how we do that kind of thing

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,240
but here's kind of an overview of the

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,920
rest of the day

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,000
after scott bridget's going to talk

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,920
about documentation in more detail

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,120
a documentation is an excellent place to

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,600
jump in and get started

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
um ronan's going to take it from bridget

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,720
and talk about the mechanics of the

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,639
website so if you want to improve the

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,120
helm.sh website with

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,959
css changes or html changes or things of

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,000
that nature ronin will kind of give a

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,720
high level of overview

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
on how to change those kinds of things

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,760
after that

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,920
martin is going to talk about coding and

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
coding guidelines in helm

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,839
when you're ready to open that first pr

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,680
the stuff that martin says

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,519
first code pr against helmhelm the stuff

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,360
that martin tells you about will be

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,720
very very important for you i'm really

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,199
looking forward to that one

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,800
we'll have a short break there and then

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,560
we will come back and i will cover

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,720
governance in more detail i'll go back

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,160
to that earlier cncf slide and explain

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
what each of those things mean and what

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,199
the security team actually does

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,720
and what core maintainers

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:35,600
responsibilities are and things of that

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,279
nature

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:39,760
matt fisher is going to deep dive into

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,680
the helm improvement proposal process

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,880
and explain how to do one of those so at

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,000
that point at which you're really

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,880
interested in starting some

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,800
major features or or jumping into a hip

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,279
proposal and helping people refine those

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,839
major

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,680
uh feature changes uh everything matt

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,199
fisher has will be helpful there

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,360
and then adam will walk us through the

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,440
process of reviewing pr's cutting prs

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,440
and explain how we as maintainers

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:04,480
really go about that process and how you

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,560
can streamline that process for yourself

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,680
as you issue prs and how if you become a

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,839
core maintainer you can

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,720
help out in those regards then finally

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,120
not on here

00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,480
uh karen and i will return here and

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,800
close the session down

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,160
uh i i think we can tip our hand now and

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,440
say there will be some awards and things

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,160
like that at the end

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,760
so it's going to be an exciting day here

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,079
i'm going to hand over now

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,199
to scott i'm going to try and stop my

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,240
screen sharing

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,720
uh so that he can try starting his

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,240
and we'll make this first transition

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,759
from speaker to speaker and see how this

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,440
goes but thank you all again

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,199
for being here today i'd like to

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
introduce scott rigby one of the core

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,839
maintainers of

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,480
okay can you hear me

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,800
and see me wow okay this was going to be

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,079
a complete surprise for me

00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,360
how it worked fantastic hi everyone

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,720
um so yes i yeah scott rigby

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,079
um i i'm a i work in developer

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,120
experience at weaveworks

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,800
now um i am i've been involved in the

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
helm project for some years

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,079
i've worked yeah i'm one of the core

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,079
maintainers i helped i'm on

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:19,680
the um the organization maintainer uh

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,279
group which we'll be covered later it

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,240
sounds like and

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,959
um and i've i think the primary focus

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,000
that i've had

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:31,440
within the helm project apart from that

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,120
has been the um the ways that users

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,079
interact with charts

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,560
so um i had worked as a co-maintainer of

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:40,079
the

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,519
the stable and incubator central charts

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,639
repositories before those got

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,320
decentralized

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,920
um worked a lot in helping to

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,560
decentralize those

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,000
um and i can just i can only i can

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,560
briefly mention what that is

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,079
when looking over the repo so that you

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,600
have a good sense of

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,880
um what if you're as a new maintainer as

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,000
a as a potential new maintainer or

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,920
contributor or rather

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,319
um as you're looking over the repos

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,760
you'll see various past projects and

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:09,839
one of them is that and also i help with

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,039
i'm with the team that helps with uh

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,439
tooling that

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,160
helm excuse me that charts maintainers

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,760
use

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,760
to um to do what they need to do

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,199
including hosting health repose and

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,360
testing their charts and so on and

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,640
automating them

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,559
so i have not i haven't actually asked

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,679
if you can hear me well

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:34,160
still yeah you're doing great

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,480
you're you're clear okay awesome um

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,160
okay great uh and then i'm gonna try

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,880
screen sharing for the first time

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,679
um so bear with me for a second and just

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,440
for everyone here

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,559
please ask questions or um

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,919
really just feel free to interact um

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,240
each presenter might be different but

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,640
for me it's very informal interactive

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,559
here

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,400
um i simply just volunteered to give an

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,640
overview so

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:04,710
here is the screen share

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,360
let's see i think i can do this here

00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,760
[Music]

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,760
yes

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
can you see my screen

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,400
sorry can you see my screen okay

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,799
i'm having trouble knowing if this is

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,440
working or not i'm going to unmute

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,360
we can see a black screen and the mouse

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,600
pointer but nothing else right now

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,600
oh really okay um

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,360
well hopefully it'll just fast forward

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
quickly

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,440
what browser are you using i am using

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,880
chrome

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
hmm i

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,480
wasn't sure if that was a mistake or not

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,760
no that should be like the optimal

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,880
browser because i think the back end of

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,480
this is hangouts

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,480
um right yeah

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,799
okay well are we still on i can try

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,320
stopping and restarting or

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,320
uh connecting and disconnecting

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,919
yeah it looks still black okay

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,520
well um okay so i haven't planned a

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:26,720
backup exactly except i could what i

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,160
could do is talk

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,240
through them that might not be as

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,600
engaging but why don't i try stopping

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,080
and starting my screen share again just

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,880
once

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,080
and see if that helps yes okay uh and as

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,000
a suggestion if you

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,880
uh jump out and jump in back here

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,919
so sometimes this can solve the similar

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,840
technical difficulties

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,039
okay who are you mean jumping out of

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,280
bevy and back yeah

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,120
yeah okay i'll try that and we'll you

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,120
know we'll see we'll see how it goes um

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,000
okay

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,000
thank you be right back

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,799
yeah so while he's doing that uh do we

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,799
have a uh the

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,240
the times for the schedule are they

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,000
posted somewhere

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,679
karen uh for when we have our break and

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,200
um i forgot to share that at the

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,200
beginning

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,000
i added it to the description and the um

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:35,840
computer summit slash channel i will

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:35,840
also drop it in the chat here as well

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,640
all right i dropped it in chat i can't

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,440
really format my texts so it looks a

00:20:48,640 --> 00:21:03,840
little messy

00:20:49,440 --> 00:21:03,840
but that is all in specific times

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,880
with that schedule there i can go so uh

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,440
so scott will come back and

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,960
and finish up the introduction section

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,559
uh then we'll talk about

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,679
how things change in helm and that whole

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,640
section which will have multiple

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,320
speakers will cover

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,240
sort of the the day-to-day how you

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,080
submit changes and things like that

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
then after the break we'll come back and

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,520
really take more of the maintainer view

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,919
of things and talk about

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:30,000
uh how how things are changed and how

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,360
core maintainers interoperate with and

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
what our different processes are and

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,480
things like that so the first part will

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
be very practical about how to get

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,960
started

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,600
and the second part will be oriented

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,320
more toward how core maintainers work

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,919
and what the inner mechanisms are again

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,600
with an eye for helping people who might

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,960
want to be maintainers to understand

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,320
what that involves

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,840
all right scott looks like you're back

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,880
i'm gonna hand it back over to you and

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,840
let you give it a

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,280
shot with the screen share okay great

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,880
that sounds that sounds good

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:03,200
um all right uh

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,200
fingers crossed one more time

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,760
you know what again in worst case i can

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,320
just i can just speak to them briefly

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
and

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,000
um will be will be uh everyone else's

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,480
presentation will be

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,760
at at some point referring back to these

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,880
repositories so

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,600
um you won't miss it entirely but

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,600
if that's the case

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,000
okay uh can you see

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,159
can you see um uh anything besides a

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,159
blank screen now

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,159
unfortunately it's a mouse

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,320
oh no there's gotta be one there's at

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,600
least one right one in every conference

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,360
okay

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,640
well um what do you think what do you

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,159
think should i should i

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,159
at this point go ahead and just speak to

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
some of these repos briefly i think that

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,240
might be a good idea

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,039
or would you rather just um go ahead

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,320
okay okay well in that case i'll in that

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,720
case i'll stop sharing

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,360
um that doesn't really help you okay

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,559
great well um

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,840
so we we only have a few minutes now um

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,240
sorry about the technical difficulties

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,559
but um

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,760
uh what i'll do is i'll paste these into

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,280
i'll paste these into

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,000
the chat so uh you i'm sure you know the

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,760
very first

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,039
repo that you want to be looking at uh

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,400
that matt mentioned is

00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,120
is um the client and sdk um and the

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,200
website

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:38,240
uh those are here and here um

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,440
uh it's important to note that the

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,799
repositories are they're not strictly

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,400
categorized at the moment

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,480
but they have different val different

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,480
functions so

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,240
so those two you're probably most uh

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,039
everyone here hopefully is most aware of

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,559
it if you're not and if you're

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,240
interested in becoming aware

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,960
definitely focus your attention

00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,400
primarily on the helm client and sdk

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:02,720
website or excuse me uh repo for code

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,320
the website for for documentation and so

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,080
on um

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,520
uh to get an overview i guess you're

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,840
going to go over this matt so i won't

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,960
get too into what's in the community

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,559
repo except

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,480
this is where you find things about

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:17,279
governance the process

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,799
um or the processes for everything

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:21,760
related to the project

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,440
helm as a project itself and not um only

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,200
to its primary core

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:30,640
um client or its other um

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,320
sub projects or tools and okay there

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,919
i'll fly a little more quickly here

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,440
there are other sub-projects

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,760
so um uh several several of them are

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,039
longer-term projects that uh are

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,120
expected to continue

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:45,440
um one for example is chart museum

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,559
that's that's that's one that is uh

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:51,919
listed often because it's used by

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,240
many people it is it is supported

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,080
um there is also there are also several

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,400
projects um i just want to mention

00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,360
uh you can kind of not ignore but just

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,720
keep your eyes

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,760
peeled for uh their deprecation at some

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,159
point there is a project called

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,120
monocular which um

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,240
which that is getting into that category

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,960
um helm hub

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,279
i'll just paste it here it is something

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
that

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,720
is going to be deprecated it hasn't

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,400
officially been the repo hasn't

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
officially been made obsolete

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,279
the tool that it ran is deprecated it

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,080
now uh points to artifact hub.io the

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:27,200
cncf

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,080
aggregator for all cncf cloud native

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
packages

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,640
um and then the other things i just want

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
to mention really briefly i don't want

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,440
to go over time really but

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,159
um thanks bridget um there are there are

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,919
chart

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:43,200
helper and automation tools and so um

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,120
just yeah um

00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,640
there's there's three of them and it

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,279
would be nicer if i could show you but

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,240
but the one that you probably are using

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,760
the most now

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,720
if you have any automation around charts

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,559
whatsoever um is charts testing

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,880
oh excuse me i actually did not type the

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,880
correct

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,320
ignore the last link but the charts

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,039
testing project it is a project written

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,320
in go

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,159
that um that does not use helm's sdk

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,440
um if you're interested in contributing

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,240
um that could really use

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,520
um some additional people it doesn't use

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
helps sdk it uses

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,880
helm's binary on purpose so that we can

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,600
test multiple versions because the point

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,440
of it is not

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,799
is not to test helm helm has its own

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,960
tests but it's to have

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,279
it's for uh chart maintainers to test

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,679
charts so it's a very very helpful

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,200
um project it allows you for example to

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,039
uh to install

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,799
chart basically everything you can do as

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,679
a manual user with the client

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,480
uh dry runs but what it also does is

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,279
automate

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,480
uh it allows you to put in uh tests and

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,080
automate those and also integrate with

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,840
other great tools around testing

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,080
so it's very helpful for keeping things

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,720
stable um there's a tool called

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,080
called chart releaser uh and that i'm

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,559
just going to briefly mention it

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,679
it is a it is a different way of hosting

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,360
helm repose

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,919
than um than chart museum uh rather than

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,960
running

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,440
um in cluster uh and

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,159
and running as a separate application it

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,559
really just

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,760
leverages um at this point github it

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,520
could integrate with gitlab

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,799
but uh uses github pages in order to

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,559
host helm repos

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,559
which is exactly what the stable and

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,360
incubator repos uh package history is

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,399
doing now

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,559
thanks to github um there are other

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,679
helper tools um those two two are for

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:25,120
sharp maintainers

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:28,559
um or excuse me those two are for

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,840
people who are uh using um let's say end

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,159
users using charts

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,320
um releasers for chart maintainers and

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,120
then the helm two to three i just

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,320
pasted the helm2 plug-in um this i don't

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,600
know if this is a good category for it

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,039
but i believe it's a good

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,320
helper tool for um for practitioners uh

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,159
human operators as well

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,480
when they're upgrading from uh the

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,320
former version of helm uh held two to

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,840
the current version hub3

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,840
so the last thing i think i should say

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,880
because it's now 9 32 i don't want to be

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,720
too

00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,840
too um uh go to over

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,960
um is oh thanks bridget

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:08,880
is uh there are several helm actions

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:12,000
and this is important for um uh

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,559
for knowing that uh excuse me for

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,039
being able to get up to speed quickly

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,640
and

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,320
automate the above tools that i

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,039
mentioned so um

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,159
the the releaser that allows you to post

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,640
your own home repos

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:27,039
without having to pay for other tooling

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,480
um and the testing so

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,440
i have one demo link that i'm gonna

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,159
paste and i think i'm just going to

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,240
leave it

00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,399
at that for this section for the actions

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,600
because this page has a the readme has

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,799
very good documentation

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,640
well simple and clear documentation

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,360
about what the other actions are

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
um in short there's an action for the

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,159
client

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,679
the kubernetes kind project just so that

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,279
you can we can do

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,120
we can test charts inside of clusters

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,000
that are quickly spun up um within

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,720
automation

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,440
um and then it wraps around the other

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,559
two projects i

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,360
mentioned uh chart test testing and

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,399
um chart releasing so it allows it

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,080
allows you to um

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,520
basically get up to speed and running

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,240
without really knowing a whole lot

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,679
to start but with good practices good

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,360
and safe practices

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,720
that can be supported and then you can

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,760
dive in deeper from there

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,679
there's no real magic under the hood so

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,120
um there are several others that for

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,240
example there's a homebrew tap

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:24,720
that helps with uh that helps with

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,159
our homegroup packages um because we

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,520
have several other binaries

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,320
uh that um that are not in um

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,919
in the in the homebrew core yet but um

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,760
but the rest are are really just

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,960
um there are some docker images you

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,200
might see in there that

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,320
um some of them are being used but

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,320
others will be

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,520
made obsolete relatively in the not too

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:46,799
distant future

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,640
um there are um

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,960
uh and i think the last thing probably

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,919
is just when you see the helm slash

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,880
charts

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,480
uh repository that's one of the most

00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,440
contributed to repositories within the

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,360
helmorg

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,640
uh i should i say one only because i'm

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,679
not sure if it is the but

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,520
um it is it is not the place to put

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,720
effort into anymore but you can still

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,159
use that

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:13,840
that repository to um to

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,279
for a history of what has happened with

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,480
charts that you're using around the wild

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,720
now that have moved to separate

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,480
repositories it's the source code

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,240
for for uh for many many um

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,080
excuse me for charts that install many

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,760
different cloud native applications

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,520
up to a certain point up ultimately to

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,360
last fall

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,120
so i hope that helps i'm five minutes

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,039
over um

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,320
were there any questions that anybody

00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,440
had

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,840
or should i just go ahead and pass the

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840

here and um

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,480
move on to the next section um okay so

00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,840
i'm going to do a screen share

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,039
can everyone hear my voice okay

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,039
just making sure before we go

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,840
i can hear you you're good

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,120
okay

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,480
all right i am going to do a screen

00:31:45,120 --> 00:32:01,840
share

00:31:46,480 --> 00:32:01,840
hopefully this works

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:15,840
nothing seems to be happening sorry bear

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:15,840
with me a second

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,360
okay um i think i need to do what scott

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,279
did

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,200
i'm going to very quickly leave and come

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,679
back um

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,840
apologies for this i will be about

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,519
hopefully just a few seconds

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,840
um this is where we would put on the

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,320
whole music

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,159
right back all right so uh so we're

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,919
heading into that second section uh the

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,200
three big topics we're going to discuss

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,840
in this section will be

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,679
ronin leading off with uh with sort of

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,440
the mechanics of the website

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,720
uh followed by i believe bridget is

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,000
following ronin and we'll talk about

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,679
documentation and then

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,120
martin is following bridget and we'll be

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,480
talking about

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:10,080
uh the process of coding

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:13,200
all right ronan welcome back

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,120
everyone can see my desktop okay

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,559
okay sorry about that okay thank you for

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,880
your patience everyone

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,600
so um i'm going to go through this

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,279
section which

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,760
is the how things change in helm section

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,679
so um hopefully everyone can see these

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,840
slides

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,039
um so this is going to be i'm going to

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,720
move pretty quickly there's

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,960
three different kind of subsections in

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,159
this because a lot of things change in

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,440
helm

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,120
so i'm going to take the first segment

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,399
which is just kind of like an overview

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,279
of the website

00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:45,360
some of the tools that we use for for

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,159
running and making changes to that

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:49,840
and bridget then is going to look at the

00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,159
documentation section of the website

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,519
which

00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,360
is probably the area that sees the most

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,559
activity we have a lot of docs

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,240
a lot of different languages um and then

00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,200
martin will pick it up to talk about the

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,159
coding processes

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,679
um around working and contributing to

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,880
the helm

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,599
core so without further ado

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,960
just introduce myself i'm ronan um i've

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,040
been kind of doing things

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,399
contributing to some of the helm assets

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,960
for a few years

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,879
um the helm website really has been

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,240
around since about 2017

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:24,240
maybe earlier maybe 2016 and um it's

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,320
as the project has moved into uh the

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,440
cncf and um

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,280
you know we have a lot of like extra

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,800
resources through them and there are

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,879
they help us to

00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,480
host run maintain some of the tools that

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:36,639
we use here and

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,000
the site is pretty busy we get about 50

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,520
to 60k

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,119
and visitors every month so there's a

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,040
lot of traffic as you can imagine a lot

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,800
of it is looking at docs

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,480
and trying to figure out how to use helm

00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,159
in different different situations which

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,919
bridget will cover

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,000
so um i just want to give a quick kind

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,320
of run through of what's involved in

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,480
that

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,760
and uh see if anyone is kind of

00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,160
interested in helping you know

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,800
make edits uh commit changes and code to

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,440
the to the helm dub dub dub repo

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,839
so you know hopefully most people here

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
are

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,200
a little bit familiar with this this is

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,240
just like the landing page explains the

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,760
project

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,960
and this is like that where you arrive

00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,920
at the site and this is how most people

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,440
i guess would have their

00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,520
their gateway to helm if they're not

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,320
already looking at the github repo

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,800
um the site really is composed of three

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,040
distinct sections we have the homepage

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,320
we have um the docs section which

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:26,320
bridget will talk about

00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,000
and which is a lot more article focused

00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,079
rather than explaining what helm is it's

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,440
explaining how to use helm

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,359
and localization is has been a big

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,599
push for us over the last probably a

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,079
year and a half to um

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,359
to allow people in different languages

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,560
and different different parts of the

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,079
world to

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,839
understand how i'm in their own their

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,359
own local language

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,920
and then the blog which acts as kind of

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,400
again like like our twitter account um

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,960
announcements uh deep dives into some of

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,000
the recent events around security audits

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,359
and cncf milestones project birthdays

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,560
and so forth

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,720
and so i'm going to show you kind of

00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,400
like what's behind the website um

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,760
all these sections which are kind of

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,880
very different in

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,560
uh in their purpose and their kind of

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,920
layout they all work off the same code

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,160
base

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:15,680
which is the helm dub dub dub project

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,520
and um

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,040
you know as matt was talking about with

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,560
our github workflow

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,040
as an open source project in the cncf um

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,400
we try to use github for everything so

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,960
we have community repo

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,240
where we kind of put things like um you

00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,400
know brand assets

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,520
um any different kind of presentation

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,480
slides uh

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,839
fonts things you might look look for um

00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,680
if you're interacting with the project

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,760
that can be a useful place to check out

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,560
um scott gave a nice run-through of some

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,920
of the other

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,680
repos that are out there really we try

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,680
and keep everything published and

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,960
accessible via github

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,800
um so the website code base is

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,560
i think as mentioned earlier it's the

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,160
helm dub dub dub repo

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,839
it's built on hugo which is a static

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,000
site generator

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:05,440
um it is

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,720
um basically you know it's it's a what

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,680
they call part of like the jam stack

00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,160
there's no database

00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,000
it just generates markdown files into a

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,560
website and puts it on a server

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,560
that people can use and it's pretty low

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,480
frills and easy to maintain

00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,920
so i'll give a look through some of

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,040
those tools in a moment

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,599
and the google site is then pushed up to

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:26,240
netlify through the github workflow

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,079
which i'll

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,000
show a little bit more of in a moment um

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,119
and it really allows us to keep things

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,760
synced up and deployed

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,000
pretty quickly it's a nice light uh kind

00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,079
of chain of things

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,280
so the the main repo here

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,400
looks something like this you'll see uh

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,119
you'll see the uh readme is pretty kind

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,599
of thorough

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,599
around how you run the site how you how

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,480
you develop it and interact with hugo

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,920
um the deployment you can actually see

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,720
all the different logs and so forth

00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,560
through netlify

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,000
every time there's a push to the project

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,520
it gets deployed as a feature

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,599
branch that you can kind of like test

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,520
and preview your um

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,880
your changes before they get merged and

00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,960
allows you to kind of test things like

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,040
design changes or to see how

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,079
blog posts or even documentation changes

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,520
look before they're added to the site um

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,720
so let's see so to look into that a

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,400
little bit more

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,079
um we're going to talk about

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,160
how that looks from a pull request point

00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,599
of view matt butcher kind of explained

00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,640
the project's um

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,160
github workflow process and it's a

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,400
similar process for

00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,680
making changes to the website uh whether

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,200
you're making changes to the landing

00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:46,240
page to the documentation

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,040
to the blog um everything goes through

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,000
uh git commit and pull request review

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,400
process

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,520
um so the project maintainers would

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,240
review

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,520
um pull requests before it's eligible

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,440
for merging

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,280
before it's merging you will see this

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:04,400
section down here which is the checks

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:06,240
uh we have a dco which is our um

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,920
commit signing process which i think

00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,640
martin will be discussing in a bit more

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,400
depth

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,160
and the second one you see here is this

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,520
um netlifecheck and that's where it

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,960
renders a

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,079
deploy preview so it's it's nice it

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,400
allows you to see if anything's going to

00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,720
break

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,760
before before it's uh deployed to the

00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,680
site

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,520
and um we have an example of that ready

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,359
to go over here so i'm going to show you

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,359
what that currently looks like here's a

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,520
pr from bridget who uh

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:32,839
she made this yesterday helm uh updated

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,560
from its um

00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:39,359
3.5.2 release to its 3.5.3 release

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,480
uh just about a day or two ago and the

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,800
website doesn't reflect it

00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,400
it's out of date so i'm going to very

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:46,320
quickly review

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,440
the pull request i'm going to give it a

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,440
thumbs up and i'm going to merge it

00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:54,079
so you can see here in files changed uh

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,640
the version got bumped here it's a very

00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,280
small pull request

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,079
i'm going to review and approve and as

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,240
i'm one of the

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,079
administrators on this repo once i have

00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,040
given approval to this

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,599
um the butt turns green my checks are

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,359
all green

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:11,440
so i'm going to merge and what's going

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,040
to happen is it's very quickly going to

00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,400
build and deploy the site to go from

00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,319
from that version to the new one

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,920
so we can see in the this is the netlify

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,880
interface which is running the site this

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,920
is an accounting

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,440
that is run with the cncf um

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,640
we do all our builds and deploys through

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,920
this also dns configuration is here

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,680
and it very quickly is going to build

00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,800
and deploy that website

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,960
and while that's happening i'm just

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,599
going to switch over to the site here

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,880
and show you what's currently up there

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,599
so go to the docs we'll see it's showing

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,640
the old version 3.5.2 as the stable

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,880
version

00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,160
um you know within about a minute or two

00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,359
that that will be

00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,359
pushed up to the new one

00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,680
okay so that's kind of like the

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,359
a quick example of how it works bridget

00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,520
will get into some of the more details

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,040
uh around you know making changes to the

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,720
docs how

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,800
versioning works or signing off

00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,880
forgetting how localization is set up

00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,960
and the readme really is pretty thorough

00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,800
we have a lot of um

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,240
good processes and things defined within

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,520
the home project you have contribution

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,160
guides or at

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,680
uh checklist and so forth um the doc

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,440
site really is a great starting point

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,640
for any questions you have

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,680
um and if you're curious about

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,920
about the helm project and the website

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:35,680
we try and use issues like um for

00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,839
tracking any bugs or anything we want to

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,680
make as an enhancement or so forth

00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,960
and we have a special label called good

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,800
first issue which is a nice

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,319
starting point if you're curious about

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,680
how can i be of use to this project i've

00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,160
been looking at this code base

00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,760
and you know i'm trying to figure out

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,040
what small things can i do to sort of

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,560
get familiar with the tooling

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:54,560
the good first issue label is a nice

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,359
resource for that here's some small like

00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,280
things that

00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,720
are on my list of tasks to fix up and

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,000
we always welcome contributions if

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,079
anyone wants to look at this stuff and

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,680
if there's any questions around how

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,760
you interact with this tooling you know

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,680
how do you install hugo how do you

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,839
kind of like you know how do you resolve

00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,319
maybe a broken build in nutlify

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,319
um you know the slack channel is a great

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,319
place to come and ping one of us but uh

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,119
hopefully our documentation and our

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:21,680
readmes are

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,680
pretty thorough

00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:25,839
okay so that's the bulk of things i

00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,079
wanted to cover

00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,040
um you know there's a lot of different

00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,520
parts of the site

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,119
been working on this for for for a

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,480
couple of years and um

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,839
we always appreciate new people coming

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,680
in with fresh eyes to look at this and

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,440
notice things that we don't notice

00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,359
um if you have questions the slack

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,640
channel that's um been set up for this

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,680
event is a great place to go with your

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,119
questions

00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,800
you know you can ping me if you have any

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,400
specific stuff around the website at the

00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,119
front end the design

00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,880
i'd love to help um without further ado

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,240
i'll pass it on to bridget because

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,400
that's coming up i think on about 10

00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:59,680
minutes and uh we're just going to go

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,839
next and we'll talk tomorrow

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,359
thank you so much ronan but before you

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,800
unshare your screen you want to show us

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:08,560
that finished build

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,800
yes that's a good point let's go back to

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,079
that

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:14,480
character change yes it's a big deal

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,760
um thank you for that commitment it's

00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,319
awesome okay so yeah it's published

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,839
green

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,599
everything looks magical it took one

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,960
minute and 38 seconds to deploy that

00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,000
which is why we love static sites

00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,760
because

00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,280
there's not a lot of uh extra stuff to

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,680
do it's pretty swift

00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,560
so if i refresh the docs homepage here

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,920
yeah so there we go three five three and

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,800
that's it it's pretty pretty

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,760
uh pretty quick so thank you for your pr

00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:43,040
thank you for contributing to help

00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,040
pr is too small

00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,280
so now i get to try the very exciting

00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:56,880
screen share process

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,880
oh boy it has so many choices

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,720
i'm going to attempt fate and try the

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,800
chrome tab even though it

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,480
might be a betrayal of all

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:13,920
how did that work i think it worked yeah

00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,960
i see your slide fantastic okay

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,680
so what we're looking at here

00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:21,839
is the docs and i think if we start by

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,040
just looking at helm dot

00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,720
docs and we see that it's

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,680
it's kind of a lot um oh

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,960
exciting okay now i see the difference

00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,319
i'm just going to stop sharing and

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
restart because

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,240
i have a bunch of tabs and it really

00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,880
only shared the one tab

00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,880
how exciting

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,839
okay we're gonna try that

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,319
that's a little bit better because now i

00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,079
can actually change to other tabs

00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:56,079
all right so if we take a look at the

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,920
home docs that we were just

00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:59,440
on oh and i can reload that and see

00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,680
we're at 353 now

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,760
hurry um when we take a look at the home

00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,000
docs we actually have this front page

00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,319
that

00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,240
says how it's organized and it's

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,040
probably a good idea to take a look

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,480
through that

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,640
because the various types of docs are

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,400
pretty different from each other the

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,400
tutorials are a really good place to

00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,760
start if you're new to home and you want

00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,599
to try something

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,440
and if you want to pr in something that

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,119
says yeah you're making a giant leap of

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:27,520
logic here with this tutorial

00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,480
open an issue or make a pr to the docs

00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,400
repo and say

00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,760
where the tutorial uh missed out on

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,040
explaining something

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,760
the uh topic guides again like

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,240
they're more detailed explanations but

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:41,599
uh

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,839
more high level right so key topics um

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:44,640
concepts etc if we take a look at some

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,240
of these like

00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,760
oh charts hmm library charts how are

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,680
those different from charts

00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,200
wait chart repositories there's a lot of

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,359
chart stuff going on here so you can see

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,319
there's a lot of detail

00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:58,960
again like it goes into enough detail

00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,960
that

00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,560
depending on what high-level concept

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,680
you're trying to learn the topic guides

00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,839
might be useful

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,400
okay the community guides highly

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,400
relevant to people who might want to

00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
you know actually contribute to

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,079
something this has the developer guide

00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,720
we are constantly updating our release

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:19,599
checklist

00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,440
because it turns out um there are a lot

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,599
of steps

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,800
like for example updating that you know

00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,680
three five two to

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,359
three five three it was on a checklist

00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:31,760
but it was step up ten of eleven

00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,800
what are you gonna do and um and then

00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,160
we'll talk a little bit about the

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,560
localizing two

00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:38,720
uh the how-to guides are worth taking a

00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:42,240
look at specifically because

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:45,440
they are in more depth so these

00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:48,240
are not necessarily you know uh

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,119
simple topics but they're pretty complex

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,839
topics like

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,319
say developing your own charts okay so

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:55,359
there's

00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,839
there's a lot there uh and you might be

00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:59,599
like

00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:00,319
okay what what's next where should i

00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:02,880
look

00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,079
um let's take a look actually at the doc

00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,440
site itself

00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,920
very meta because if you're going to

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:10,960
you know help with the docs you probably

00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:14,319
want to know about

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,599
the docs okay

00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,480
so is where the docs actually are this

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,720
is that repo

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,880
that ronan was in before that he was

00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:26,079
showing us you know the readme of

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,960
and the docs themselves are in

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,000
content and then they're language

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,760
specific

00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,280
and so not every language is going to

00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,680
have every single

00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,280
thing in it because it's like some of

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,559
them are

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,760
like for example there are some

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,280
languages people have actually

00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,480
translated blog posts for

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:48,079
in other languages they have not um

00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:50,480
and the the actual docs themselves

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,440
again are organized somewhat like what

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,480
you saw earlier

00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:55,760
but yeah you know there's let's talk a

00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,720
little bit about the

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,000
uh what you see here versus what you see

00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,000
on hound.sh

00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,800
so again you can see all of these top

00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,280
level things

00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,960
versus what actually shows up on the

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,319
website

00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,520
this we mentioned before is hugo

00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:23,920
and if we take a look at

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,359
there's front matter that needs to be on

00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,280
each kind of page

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,720
so again if you try to start

00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,200
instantiating say

00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,640
a new language just take a look at what

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:34,400
exists there already

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:37,200
because it makes it easier to scaffold

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,040
it and i do want to talk a little bit

00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,599
about that that idea of translating the

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,680
docs into an additional language

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,319
and we have a recent example that's

00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,640
pretty awesome

00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:52,480
of french and so this is all community

00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,240
you know contributed stuff people come

00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,079
along and

00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,440
they start translating there are

00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,960
you know dire there there's the

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,400
localization guide that is the

00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,040
translation guide that says

00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,240
exactly what you should translate or

00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,119
what you should configure when you're

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,520
translating

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,800
um but there's like this config.toml

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:12,960
that

00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,559
ronan mentioned briefly you have to have

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,119
a section in there

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,760
and then you have to have like your at

00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,240
the

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,280
at the bare minimum probably like the

00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:23,680
index page

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,680
and then whatever other pages that you

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,920
want to translate

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,839
can be in a pull request you can kind of

00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,160
see

00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:32,160
and how

00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,720
some of us like you should have paula

00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,720
francais

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,559
um so in some cases we may not have

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,200
reviewers who

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,119
speak a language so we'll just take a

00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,119
look and see oh did they do anything

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,640
obvious like leave some english in there

00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:51,920
maybe they don't want to do that

00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,599
or capitalization uh

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,280
could be a problem because passer case

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,800
sensitive that sort of thing

00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,800
so if you're thinking well how do i help

00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,160
here you can review pull requests either

00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,200
if they're in your language or in a

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,280
different language

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,319
you know just depending on what you

00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,839
speak

00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:11,200
and then um this

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,000
i you know got merged in and we go and

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:17,440
we look at the docs and we think

00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,520
fantastic we have french now you know

00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,920
oh look we have a css issue that we need

00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,520
to fix but we have french now

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,160
right so uh

00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,040
one other thing to note before i pass it

00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:31,440
over to talk

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,119
for martin to talk more about code is

00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,280
there's an interesting corner case

00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:38,480
around translation

00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,480
there are um

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:45,040
these home commands the cli uh commands

00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,640
to give you like information

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:52,000
that you can get from the helm uh

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:55,359
binary itself this stuff is compiled

00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:58,160
into the binary in english and

00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,880
then people might translate it and we

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,280
just

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,280
pr those translations into the website

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,359
because we don't have a way to have the

00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:08,000
binary the home binary itself

00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,760
output other languages so that's an

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,800
interesting corner case

00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,559
that just keep in mind like this kind of

00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,480
thing is evolving all the time

00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,400
perhaps hey you'll come in with a

00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,359
contribution to find an even better way

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,319
to do that

00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,839
um but anyways that's the docs for the

00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:27,520
most part are in

00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:28,079
uh the depth of repo and oh one other

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,280
thing about

00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:33,200
translation uh it's wonderful if

00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:35,119
multiple members of the same language

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,040
family want to

00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,599
review each other's translations because

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,720
in this case for example

00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:46,400
we get a whole bunch of people you know

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:49,440
commenting on and um contributing to

00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,359
a specific pull request you know saying

00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:54,960
oh what about this what about this and

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,240
and iterating on it and making it better

00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,000
and so if you're thinking i want to

00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,400
contribute to helm but

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,240
i'm not you know a home expert or i

00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,200
don't know enough go and so i don't know

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,680
if i can

00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,280
you probably can just by contributing

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:11,520
this sort of contribution

00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,280
so all right um but i did mention that

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,720
a couple of those things are in the

00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,920
actual code base because

00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,319
brennan and i have been talking about

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,800
helm helm dub dub dub

00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:22,240
but there's a lot going on over in helm

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,480
helm as well

00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,400
so let's talk about actual code like

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,559
actually getting the pr is merged

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:30,559
uh we have martin hickey joining us

00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:34,160
today to talk about that i'm gonna stop

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,160
sharing my screen and let martin share

00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:45,280
thank you bridget can you hear me

00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,160
folks loud and clear oh

00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,440
fantastic let's try and share here let's

00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:53,200
keep this uh

00:52:49,440 --> 00:53:01,280
this looky uh sharing going on

00:52:53,200 --> 00:53:05,760
uh let me see here

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,760
okay can you see um safari

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,839
i don't see any screen share from you

00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,520

what's going to work here um okay let me

00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,920
stop sharing a second and let me try

00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,200
