	Keynote: A Simplified Service Mesh With gRPC - Srini Polavarapu, Engineering Manager, Google 

gRPC is a popular choice for building microservices based applications but it does not have any native service mesh features such as service discovery, load balancing, application security and observability. A service mesh typically provides such features via sidecar proxies deployed alongside the microservices. In this session, we will introduce the new exciting development of service mesh features in gRPC and show how to bring the benefits of a service mesh to your gRPC applications without the complexity of managing sidecar proxies. We will also talk about the architecture and show how you can go from a proxy based service mesh to a proxy-less service mesh with gRPC.
