hi and thanks for joining us for this

00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:07,359
year's grpc conf

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,519
a little bit different than the

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,559
welcoming we were hoping to have

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,519
within beautiful austin texas but that's

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,839
all right

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,720
one advantage of having a virtual event

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,720
is that we can

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
share all of our amazing stuff with

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,560
people across the world

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,039
folks who would normally be able to

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,599
attend in person are now able to attend

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,119
and

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,720
share with us the things they're working

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,800
on meet others and

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,280
and learn from everyone so this is a

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,920
really really nice alternative

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,840
hopefully next year we'll be able to all

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,960
be together in person

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,440
at this event and many others i want to

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,320
again

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
thank you all for attending and for

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,440
sending your

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,680
submission ideas and just being part of

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,480
the grpc community

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,320
also i have to give a big big thanks to

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,800
our sponsors for this event

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,640
the cloud native computing foundation

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,320
and google cloud

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,719
both are the diamond sponsors and

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
without them we would not be able to do

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,560
this event

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,880
i also would like to give another thanks

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,720
to the cloud native computing foundation

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:15,439
for doing an underwriting of a

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,280
tech writer that we have working on grpc

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,439
documentation

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,040
this is something that we've been

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,920
hearing from a lot of you

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,000
for quite a while that we needed to kind

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,040
of give the whole documentation site an

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
overhaul

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,920
improve some things and make it more

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,240
user-friendly so we're very excited

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,840

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,200
a big thanks to the microsoft team for

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:16,800
