Description: 
	Service Interoperability With gRPC - Varun Gupta & Tuhin Kanti Sharma, Salesforce 

This session will talk about the need for standardization for service to service communication at Salesforce and a solution that is implemented using gRPC across polyglot systems. We will share the implementation of our framework for Last Known Good [Artifact] service using gRPC. We will discuss how we used Java Spring Boot to implement a gRPC call framework and integrated it with a standard authentication protocol used at Salesforce. We will also share our future plans of moving to reactive streams for our gRPC service in Java.
