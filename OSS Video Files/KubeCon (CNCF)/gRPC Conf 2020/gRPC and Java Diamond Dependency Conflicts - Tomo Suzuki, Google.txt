Description: 
	gRPC and Java Diamond Dependency Conflicts - Tomo Suzuki, Google 

As more frameworks integrate with gRPC, the more complex their dependency graphs become. The complexity has caused Java Diamond Dependency conflicts, which often manifest as NoSuchMethodError or NoClassDefFoundError at runtime for gRPC, GAX, and OpenCensus classes. The conflicts degrade productivity of your project as well as your customers’. In this talk, Tomo will explain the anatomy of Java Diamond Dependency conflicts among gRPC-related libraries. The audience will also learn Google’s best practices for Java libraries and Linkage Checker, a tool that detects dependency conflicts in their Java projects.
