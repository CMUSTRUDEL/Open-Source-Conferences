all right well thank you all for having

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,200
me here today

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:10,080
i am um here to talk to you about

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,480
docs as you might have seen and anyway

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,160
hi

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:16,480
i'm erin mckean i work on docs advocacy

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,439
in google's open source programs office

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,880
and my job and it's a fun one is to help

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,320
open source projects have

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,160
better documentation so

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,000
you might not have heard the term docs

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
advocacy before

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,160
because it's pretty new but basically

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,800
doc's advocacy is about

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,960
bringing better documentation practices

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,320
to the folks who often have

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
the most power to make change and that's

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,680
developers

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
so ducks advocacy is really a developer

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,399
focused practice

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
of encouraging better software

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,079
documentation

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,320
and that's whether you start as a

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,559
developer creating better docs yourself

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
or by giving other people the power to

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,000
make better docs

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,760
or just by creating a culture that

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,800
values documentation

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,479
so that better docs are produced now i

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,439
think we all know that docs are

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,080
important

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,560
but sometimes people are surprised by

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,080
just

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,759
how important documentation is so

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,439
in a recent tidelift survey 72

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,280
of the developers that were surveyed

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,720
said that established policies and

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,360
documentation

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,479
is a key factor when they decide to

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,479
choose something open source

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,000
and i'm focused on open source uh

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,640
statistics here because that's what i

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,799
work on

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,920
but i can't imagine that close soft

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,600
source software has

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,640
less of a need for good documentation so

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,320
93 of surveyed developers in the github

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,360
2017 survey said that

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,600
incomplete or outdated documentation

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,479
is a pervasive problem in open source

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,439
and lack of documentation was the top

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,280
reason

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,759
that developers gave for deciding

00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,799
against using an open source project

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,439
in the digital ocean 2018 survey

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,000
so survey after survey after survey

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,799
shows

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
that developers care about docs and that

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,400
they make choices and decisions

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:17,520
based on whether there are docs

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,440
so why don't we have better dogs

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,480
um well it turns out that just telling

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,440
people hey make better docs

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,080
doesn't actually work if it did work we

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,920
wouldn't have these problems

00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,840
if you really want to have improved

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
documentation you have to make it a

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,360
priority

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,040
and then you need to signal that your

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
priorities have changed that

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,280
you are putting docs higher up on the

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,160
list of things that you need to do

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,920
you have to back up those words with

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,200
three things

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,640
and essentially their tools

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,800
time and tribute or you can use the word

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,400
thanks instead of tribute but i

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,720
i like the word tribute because it also

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,159
has you know monetary connotations which

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,840
i like

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,000
so i'm starting with tools because

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,239
saying tools to developers is like

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
waving a red flag at a bull i know that

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,680
the super devs

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,519
i know y'all super devs in the audience

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,440
are now setting up you know visions of

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,360
new and exciting tooling dancing in your

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,400
heads

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,840
no one is immune from the siren call of

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,080
new tooling

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,000
i mean who among us has not spent three

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,799
days automating a process that would

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,319
have taken us an

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,840
hour to accomplish manually it's so easy

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,480
to think that you're gonna build the

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,560
biggest

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,720
and the bestest combination you know i

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
don't know linter markdown parser and

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,840
i don't know insert your favorite

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,599
buzzword here doc's tool that the world

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,360
has ever seen

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,040
and i'm not here to tell you not to

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,959
write your fancy tool

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,480
i would be very excited to use your

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,319
fancy tool

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
if it has good documentation if it

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,720
doesn't have docs i'm not going to use

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,280
it

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,560
but i will tell you that there's a much

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,599
lower effort

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,959
higher return tool that you can focus on

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,439
something that you might not even

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,720
consider a tool at all and

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,000
that is the lowly template and the

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:12,159
humble checklist checklists

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,400
and templates answer some of the hardest

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,000
questions in documentation

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,600
where do i start what do i do when am i

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
done

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,840
reducing the cognitive load on your

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,520
documentation contributors by preempting

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,600
those questions

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,120
with checklists and with templates is

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,479
the best thing that you can do to get

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,600
better documentation

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,199
faster combining checklists and

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
templates with a wish list of

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,919
documentation types

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,680
for example making it explicit that you

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,800
what you really need is a tutorial for

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
beginners

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,880
or a guide to integrating your software

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,600
with something else

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,400
really templates and checklists are the

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,919
pre-chopped vegetables of documentation

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,960
sure you could tell everybody to

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,440
freestyle it or to trap their own onions

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,160
but if you could make things easier for

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
folks

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,880
why wouldn't you templates are

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,880
themselves documentation about how to do

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,120
documentation they're they're meta

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,960
documentation

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,199
and i think that one of the best and

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,039
most overlooked

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,360
uh benefits of templates and checklists

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,479
is that they reduce friction if there

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,120
are folks

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,880
on your team who have less social

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,600
capital like maybe they're new

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,320
maybe they have less of a voice

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,880
checklists

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
and templates and wish lists help them

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,039
get started

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,960
and make really valuable contributions

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,800
without having to ask for permission

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,720
or deal with the fallout from asking

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
about things that you know everybody

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,520
already knows

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,479
by providing clear instructions

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,120
a format for how things should look a

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,800
wish list of things that you really want

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,400
and a checklist for knowing when things

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
are done

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,319
you'd be surprised at how much faster

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,319
and how much better

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,160
your project could be creating

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,479
documentation

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,720
now if you're looking for sample

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,639
documentation templates the good docs

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,319
project is an open source project that's

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,919
working on this problem

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,080
right now this is the doctopus

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,360
which is the mascot of the good docs

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,759
project

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,960
and if you go to the project it's on

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,520
github

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,479
and raise an issue in the templates repo

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,039
asking

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,560
uh for a flavor of template that you'd

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
like to see

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,000
i personally will send you octopus

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,560
stickers covet or no

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,199
covid just add me to the issue i'm

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,400
imakin on github uh you will find me i'm

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,560
in the repo

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
but we'd really love to know what kinds

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,160
of templates

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,360
would be useful to you and would be

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,840
useful to

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,840
your project

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,560
another tool for better documentation is

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,680
doxy which is another open source

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,440
project

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,360
the good docs project is an independent

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,039
open source project but that googlers

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,080
are heavily involved in

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,479
uh doxy is a google developed open

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,039
source

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,120
theme for the hugo static site generator

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,000
so it's so hard to say hugo's static

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,360
site generator

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,479
generator quickly it's specifically

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,479
organized

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,720
to help people create technical

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,960
documentation sites quickly

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,800
and again the goal of these docs tools

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,039
whether they're a checklist a template a

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,440
wish list or a theme

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,080
is to reduce cognitive load by making it

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,680
easier

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,759
to do a reasonable thing quickly

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,720
instead of saving in instead of spending

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,599
so much time

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,759
shaving so many setup yaks that you're

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,599
too exhausted to actually do the thing

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,520
that you started to do in the first

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,160
place

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,360
so yes you need to give people tools and

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,120
there are plenty of tools that you can

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,400
give folks even before you start writing

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,000
your own

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,080
but what you really also have to give

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,120
people is time

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,400
docs can't be a nice to have

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
we've seen from the research that

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,720
they're way too important for that

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,800
sometimes i think that documentation is

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,039
in the same place that testing was

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,199
you know 10 or so years ago something

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,240
developers asked other people to do

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,120
late in the game if there was time

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,919
but we've seen how much better code is

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,479
when testing

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,840
is an everyday thing why wouldn't the

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,840
same be true for docs

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160
build time for documentation into what

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,479
you're doing because

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:35,760
even the most exciting interesting

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,680
technologically spectacular feature

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,320
is useless if no one uses it because

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,599
they don't know how

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,120
now tools and time are only part of what

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
you need for good docs

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,880
and now we're getting to the third word

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,680
tribute

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,120
what kinds of accolades what kinds of

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,440
rewards

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,040
do you give to other contributors to

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
your projects

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,560
and do you give those same rewards that

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,680
same praise

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,800
that same recognition that same feedback

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,680
to your docs contributors and if you

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,680
don't

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,800
why is that when i tell the people when

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,279
i tell people that

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,120
i i get to work on making open source

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,120
documentation better

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
they often tell me great we need better

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
docs

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
and then i ask okay well what are you

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
doing to help your projects have better

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,279
docs

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,800
let me help you do the work

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,640
that we all agree needs to be done

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,640
i'm not saying that creating better docs

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,800
is easy anything

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,240
that's really worth doing can't be

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,040
effortless

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
but you can do what you can where you

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,120
are

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,279
with what you have if you just start

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,600
i promise that you will make a lot more

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,560
progress than you think you will

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,399
but you have to have the tools to do it

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,760
have the time to do it

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,279
and you have to work to make sure that

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,440
the work that you've put in is

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,560
recognized

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,480
now there's one other thing that i

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
wanted to mention that sometimes i get

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,839
pushback from developers

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
about creating documentation and that

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,800
push back takes the form of

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,720
but i'm not a writer i understand it is

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
very scary to work on things that you

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,079
feel that you might not be very good at

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,519
and documentation is public it's very

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,399
public

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,000
but unless you are the beethoven of

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,680
software development you have been

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
expressing yourself in writing

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,760
at least as long or longer than you've

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,320
been writing code

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,320
and i'm here to tell you your writing is

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,720
fine

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,680
in my non-google time i run an extremely

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,519
large

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,240
counting by number of words online

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,399
dictionary and api called word wordneck

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:51,120
and i used to run american dictionaries

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,800
for oxford university press

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,720
and i also run the semicolon

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
appreciation society

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,640
so if you want someone to tell you not

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,560
to worry about your writing

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,320
or even if you're writing in english and

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,480
that's not your first language

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,160
i'm here to say in my professional

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,839
language person opinion

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,680
you're gonna be fine use templates

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,360
ask trusted friends to give things a

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,320
quick proofread

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,600
and i cannot stress this enough accept

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,720
corrections

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,120
gracefully and most people

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,640
will gladly overlook a few misspellings

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,480
a typo or two

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,519
or subjects that are having mild

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,200
disagreements with their verbs

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,720
if it means that they're going to get

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,760
largely useful

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,079
documentation don't wait

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,920
for the perfect time the perfect tool

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,760
the perfect words

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,399
to get in the way of making your

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,040
documentation better today

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,079
if if you can combine being able to

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,240
create

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,200
good documentation with being able to

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,880
create

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,839
good software if you want to increase

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,480
your impact and the impact of your work

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,519
better docs is an incredibly effective

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,079
way to do it

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,880
you might even call documentation skills

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,880
a superpower

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,560
so to recap i hope you're excited

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,839
about getting started where you are with

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,160
what you have

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,040
today to make better docs stocks are

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,200
important

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,160
developers tell us this again and again

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,800
and again every time we ask developers

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,720
what do they care about one of the top

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,560
answers if not the top answer is

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,560
documentation

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:37,120
but you won't get better docs until you

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,600
provide tools and time and tribute to

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,480
the people who are making them

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,279
start by providing checklists templates

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,880
wish lists

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,440
use themes that are set up for

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,240
documentation to remove the cognitive

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,399
load

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,000
to to get people over the hump of where

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
do i start

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,120
and don't worry too much about your

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
writing

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,399
just take the same amount of care that

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,720
you would take if you were

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,639
starting to code in a new language

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,880
double check

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:10,720
ask people for help but most of all

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,480
start today um i've left some time for

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,480
questions but i wanted to

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
quickly uh give you all some of the

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,519
links that i mentioned

um so the doxie theme you can see that

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,519
at doxie.dev

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,320
and that has a link to a working example

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,639
site and

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,720
also links to other sites live in the

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,880
wild that are using doxy

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,639
you can follow doxydocs on twitter you

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,040
can follow me on twitter uh

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,800
i do te tweet about tech but i also

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,199
tweet about weird word stuff so

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,240
brace yourselves um and you can follow

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,399
the good docs project on github

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,519
so thank you all so much for your time

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,680

please feel free to reach out to me with

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,920
documentation questions

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,279
please feel free to ping me at the good

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,880
docs project and raise

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,399
issues and ask for the kinds of

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,199
templates and checklists you'd like to

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,000
see

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,959
