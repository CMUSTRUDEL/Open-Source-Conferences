	Next Level gRPC With Kotlin and Coroutines - Marco Ferrer, OfferUp

When it comes to async programming on the JVM, Kotlin Coroutines are leading the pack in both versatility and performance. This session will cover how the usage of Coroutines improves the ergonomics of APIs from both a client and server perspective. It will also cover the key benefits gained by adopting the practice of structured concurrency. Attendees will learn how Coroutines enable clients and services to participate in cooperative cancellation across network boundaries. Improving overall resource utilization. See how Coroutine suspension maps naturally to gRPC's backpressure mechanisms. After which we will dive into the state of the gRPC ecosystem for Kotlin. Analyzing what the available options are for current users and what the future has in store for the ecosystem.
