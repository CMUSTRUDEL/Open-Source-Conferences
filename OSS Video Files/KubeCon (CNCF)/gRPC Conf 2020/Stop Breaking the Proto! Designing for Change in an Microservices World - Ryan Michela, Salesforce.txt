	Stop Breaking the Proto! Designing for Change in an Microservices World - Ryan Michela, Salesforce 

What's worse than having to deploy ten microservices? Having to deploy ten microservices at exactly the same time. When every change is a breaking API change, every deploy is a lockstep deploy. In this talk we explore techniques and best practices for evolving protobuf contracts without breaking downstream callers. We start by looking at what constitutes a breaking change, and then explore tactical ways to avoid breaking the service contract. Finally, we will dive into proto design patterns that can minimize the need to break our API contracts. Apply the techniques in this talk and never worry about breaking your downstream API callers again.
