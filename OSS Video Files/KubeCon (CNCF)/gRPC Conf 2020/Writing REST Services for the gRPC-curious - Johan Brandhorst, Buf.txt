	Writing REST Services for the gRPC-curious - Johan Brandhorst, Buf 

Introducing the gRPC-Gateway, which makes it possible to expose a JSON/REST interface while maintaining many of the benefits of using gRPC.

The first 10 or so minutes will be spent laying the technical ground for the talk by talking about JSON/REST, giving a quick intro into gRPC and [protocol buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), then introducing the gRPC-Gateway as a way to integrate gRPC into existing architectures with strict JSON/REST interface requirements.

There will then be a live demo showing the power of this workflow by iterating on a simple design. The audience will be able to follow along on their own by cloning the [boilerplate repository](https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/grpc-gateway-boilerplate).

Gradually more complicated topics like PATCH requests, middleware, authentication, working with browser clients, cookies, WebSockets and more will be introduced.
