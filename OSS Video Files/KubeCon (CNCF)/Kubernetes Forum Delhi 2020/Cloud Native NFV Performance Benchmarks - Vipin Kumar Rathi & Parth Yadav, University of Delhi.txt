Cloud Native NFV Performance Benchmarks - Vipin Kumar Rathi & Parth Yadav, University of Delhi 

This session will provide a brief overview of CNF orchestration, NSC (Network Service Chaining), multi-interface Pods, fast data paths, NUMA, deep dive in Benchmarking Cloud-Native NFV and ongoing Benchmarking standards and works. Unlike big, complex & heavy NFVI with fixed boundaries as specified by ETSI, the new Cloud-native NFVI is relatively simple with easy to orchestrate lightweight CNFs chained together and distributed over the cloud blurring boundaries between different components of NFVI and with the introduction of CNFs new Benchmarking considerations and methodologies have evolved like time to deploy, migrate, recover, activation delay, scaling up, the impact of chaining services, data-plane acceleration and possible deployment scenarios like Pod in VM or Bare metal . All this have resulted in a 4x3 benchmarking coverage.
