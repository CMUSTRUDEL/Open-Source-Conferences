Knative is one of the serverless frameworks that natively supports container orchestrators like Kubernetes and that serves as a battle-tested ecosystem for teams that want to run serverless applications on premises or on any cloud platform. Knative makes it easier for developers to build applications that can scale by abstracting away the complex details of the platform. Talk covers Demonstration of migrating k8s deployment to Knative service with funtionality
