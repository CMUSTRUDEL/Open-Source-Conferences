Lesson Learnt Running an Indian Bank on Kubernetes - Akshay Mathur, Xebia 

In this presentation, Xebia team will share their experience creating a modern platform based on Kubernetes. This platform is the backbone of the bank's digital transformation journey. It is helping them become API and data driven organization. We will cover following: Why Kubernetes is the right foundational technology for running the bank? Set up and best practices for creating Kubernetes cluster. What all CNCF projects we used to build the modern platform? How we manage configuration at scale for different environments? How we do release management using Helm? . How we helped bank to develop the right mindset? Best practices for distributed tracing. Best practices we use for cluster management. Best practices we use to test applications in Kubernetes. How we take care of storage concerns in our platform?

	                              so I did you allows a good lunch like                               the food yeah so I guess we have to                               thank you Khan for that so this session                               is about we running                               you know we working with Bank you know                               an Indian Bank a sort of running                               kubernetes introduction we thought there                               was enough sort of interesting learnings                               from it that might make for a good talk                                thankfully the organizers thought so too                                so here yeah so I say we so this session                                was supposed to be you know it was                                supposed to be a two-person thing with                                Shekar Gulati I think some people may                                know him is kind of known in the                                community unfortunately couldn't make it                                personal emergency so yeah it'll just be                                me which so he was doing the                                presentation a PowerPoint is not my                                primary skill and then he had to bow out                                early in the morning so this is just                                what i cobbled together last week so i                                did a version of this in bangalore over                                the weekend just to kind of get some                                feedback and then i thought we'd end up                                with us supremely you know superior                                version courtesy Shekar Gulati but yeah                                unfortunately couldn't make it he really                                wanted to be here thing he worked on it                                all of yesterday but there we go                                so this is the not as improved version                                let's put it that way                                so I guess who are we and also Shekar is                                the CTO at CBO in Gurgaon how many                                people from out of town a few of you are                                you from Bangalore Mumbai yeah because                                it took me about the same amount of time                                to come here right from Gurgaon so like                                I said checker is a CTO I kind of do                                some CN CF related you know I Drive CN                                CF sort of activities within zbr trying                                to get more traction so what is CBI I                                guess we do consulting and IT services I                                promise you this is not a sales pitch I                                kind of want to set some context you                                know why am I here so CBO does                                consulting in IITs                                we are not in infra because we're not                                TCS we do nice stuff some of you have                                been to ZB obviously we have fairly good                                DevOps and cloud practice lots of great                                cloud experience not as great at you                                know on-premise infrastructure                                experience that's not our sort of core                                skill we mostly have application                                developers we're great at software                                architecture a you know digital                                transformation is sort of a better                                bread-and-butter but you know we have                                customers we do these things for                                customers I am I too loud or something                                or am i is this better                                just okay great so digital                                transformation like I said you know                                whatever that means                                you know we can do architecture but we                                kind of depend on the on our customers                                IT teams to do the you know sort of the                                rest for us and the reason I bring this                                up is how many people here are running                                self-managed kubernetes you know maybe                                on Prem with their own infrastructure so                                I am probably envious of you guys you                                know if everything is going smoothly is                                it going smoothly because you probably                                have great sort of infrastructure                                platform teams whatever how many people                                do you have in your IT platform teams                                you know five ten twenty we all right                                okay we don't really you know we infra                                is not a core skill we don't want to                                compete with TCS right so now what                                happens if so the point is we are not a                                product organization we are not a                                start-up that kind of indicates we get a                                certain level of level of application                                developers Linux kernel contributors are                                not going to come work at CBI as much as                                we like might want you know want to have                                them we don't compete with Paytm we I                                don't think we can compete with big                                basket you know in India you know and                                then you know you have all of your so                                internationally you know if you are                                uncloudy they're all these organizations                                running openshift on Prem there are a                                lot of people on GCP on any case now a                                case is really picking up and Ani case                                you know on on AWS for we don't have a                                 lot of on Prem scale you know we don't                                 have our own data centers either right                                 which means if we set up a platform                                 covenant is base platform essentially I                                 have to get application developers                                 people I really have people I trust and                                 then upskill them we have to kind of                                 learn that right I think we tried to get                                 a really nice smart infringe in here and                                 he ended up joining Amazon so yeah that                                 tells you a lot about that so why all of                                 this so the reason is about a couple of                                 years back you know like I said we sort                                 of tied up with one of our customers a                                 sort of leading Indian Bank they wanted                                 to sort of go through a transformation                                 exercise and they came to us for sort of                                 you know you know some inputs you know                                 how do they build sort of an API                                 platform which is very data-driven Yin                                 there's a data Lake lots of data data                                 which cannot go on the cloud it has to                                 you know it's Bank RBI doesn't allow you                                 to take stuff to the to the cloud so                                 that data has to stay within the bank's                                 data centers but they want you know a                                 PSA one micro services and they have to                                 be polyglot because you know we are not                                 the only vendor they have dotnet they                                 may have Python whatever so we sort of                                 talked it over with them there was a                                 whole back-and-forth and we finally                                 ended up recommending kubernetes to them                                 which sounds great you know technically                                 it was a right choice to make but                                 somebody has to operate disk open it is                                 right it's not on the cloud maybe you                                 can get a managed service this is where                                 banks traditionally are you know some of                                 them are much further along now you know                                 your societe Generale's and your JP MCMC                                 is a bank you know but you know your                                 goldman sachs kind of people they are                                 fired of the game but then they're                                 driven internationally but traditionally                                 banks would have is ESB is you know                                 websphere you know IBM servers how many                                 people have heard of all of these things                                 you know not everything used to run in                                 containers containers are fairly new so                                 the younger folks probably don't                                 remember that and then you'd have                                 enterprise systems from IBM Oracle                                 Microsoft but the thing is there's no                                 there usually won't be a lot of clear                                 infrastructure you know automation or                                 automation is too low that                                 infrastructure orchestration you know in                                 terms of light your unit annexes or your                                 you know you'd they'll have VMware but                                 maybe not everything will be API driven                                 a lot of stuff will be manual because                                 it's also sort of dictated by where the                                 IT teams are so there will not always be                                 a clear centralized view I cannot go to                                 a bank and say give me                                            instances and you know so many buckets                                 of object storage I can't go to the IT                                 team and say that you have to really                                 work with them to get the kind of                                 compute and storage that you want so                                 they they would traditionally have long                                 release cycles and everything will be                                 heavily regulated you can't do your get                                 ups or continuous deployment because                                 releases are regulated you can only                                 release so many times per month in                                 certain windows and and they'll have                                 some cloud adoption you know typically                                 what we have seeing is that a lot of                                 people adopting does your stack for                                 instance but so then how do you get from                                 here to here right so the question is                                 why did we pick kubernetes right if you                                 have all these operational challenges as                                 well right                                 you want to sort of go so here's the                                 thing you cannot if you any enterprise                                 you're not going to digitally transform                                 your IT the next day you're not going to                                 wake up today and the CIO says tomorrow                                 we will be completely elastic that does                                 not happen right so you have to kind of                                 find inroads which is what they wanted                                 to do and what we were trying to help                                 them with so we pick kubernetes because                                 micro services or services let's drop                                 the micro they run great on cloud you                                 know you have auto scaling groups in                                 your AWS you know you have container                                 services etcetera on on Prem what is the                                 infrastructure abstraction that you                                 might want to use and there have been a                                 few over the years you know this is not                                 a new problem but we could not really go                                 in and transform the entire IT                                 operations so what we had to do is to                                 run our services because remember they                                 came to us for functional application                                 development but we needed an                                 infrastructure abstraction so that's how                                 we go out into the infrastructure game                                 to start with because they did not have                                 other people or internally who were yet                                 at that sort of level of infrastructure                                 automation                                 so we pick kubernetes medic because it                                 gives us consistent infra obstructions                                 right it has API is for provisioning you                                 know your workloads                                 everything is API driven not for storage                                 for for scaling it's all API driven                                 which is essentially what we wanted                                 because that makes our sort of                                 development experience much much                                 smoother it gives you a framework for                                 essentially building polyglot resilient                                 elastic services contain orchestration                                 etc and then in future you know the big                                 question was do we do it on Prem go on                                 cloud we can't go on cloud yet so like                                 well just run on kubernetes and then                                 tomorrow if you make up your mind or the                                 strategy shift just lift ensure of the                                 services to clear it'll just work excuse                                 me                                 plus there was a great community support                                 that was the major driver right and                                 there's high cost savings because it's                                 it's more efficient instead of getting                                 you know whatever six apps hours and                                 huge boxes we can share infrastructure                                 now so that's all well and good you all                                 already know this right the big question                                 is why don't we use open shift how many                                 people are using open ship a few of you                                 right it's it's a great solution right                                 why didn't we just go with that it's                                 managed kubernetes essentially and the                                 reason is again we are not in a place to                                 transform the IT operations of our                                 customers right they have not really                                 heard of kubernetes they had not                                 certainly two years back we were selling                                 it to them which means meant we had to                                 start somewhere                                 and open ship I mean for those of you                                 who are running in it is an investment                                 it's a great investment if you plan to                                 take it long term but if you're unsure                                 about this crappy you know company that                                 you haven't really heard of that's us                                 who are proposing this newfangled thing                                 it's a big investment it sounds like a                                 risky investment so we went back and                                 forth and then you know obviously there                                 are other platforms in the mix you know                                 privately Cloud Foundry was still it was                                 a kind of the platform of choice back                                 then for for the ecosystem in which we                                 operate which is sort of the Java                                 ecosystem you couldn't run really run                                 dotnet on it a case engine was out you                                 could                                 run it on Azure stack obviously but it's                                 it's non-managed again and then you know                                 you had IBM which no cloud private which                                 kind of doesn't exist in its current                                 state internally that was Cloud Foundry                                 again and PKS had just come out so we                                 had a lot of back-and-forth PKS you know                                 the reason we didn't because they didn't                                 really push for it I think for us as                                 well them going with a managed service                                 would have made sense you know IBM is                                 pretty good at that but PKS licensing                                 adding then was per part or something                                 which made no sense you know you                                 couldn't really scale that out and open                                 shift had its community version which we                                 could have gone with and migrated to OCP                                 down the line but you know it's it's a                                 community open-source version in a                                 financial institution you want something                                 that at least heavily supported by the                                 community so you know open-source                                 communities was was that we had had                                 enough sort of experience this was not                                 our first experience with kubernetes we                                 had had enough people you know sort of                                 managing open share of managing cloud                                 kubernetes servers for about you know GK                                 for a bunch of our customers but this                                 was essentially us having to manage the                                 kubernetes platform itself so this infra                                 which we don't get into and don't want                                 to get into and then there's the                                 platform itself which ideally is this                                 better I mean oh is this too loud okay                                 step back so where was I right so                                 community kubernetes made to be like I                                 said we have application developers we                                 didn't really want to deal with the                                 kubernetes layer we wanted to submit                                 pods and deployments but they're like no                                 you have to run this platform as well                                 and then this is one division you still                                 have to go in and sell it to the other                                 stakeholders within the bank because you                                 cannot run forward of your IT teams                                 right they're the ones giving you the                                 infrastructure so we kind of detailed                                 out the components we had and if you                                 look at this it's all open source right                                 once we could not go OCP we essentially                                 picked up all the we tried to get                                 support for a couple of pieces for                                 docker etcetera but the people we talked                                 to for the registry basically said well                                 you can buy a kubernetes managed cluster                                 from                                 and then you can run the registry on top                                 of it I already have a Chester I don't                                 need another one so this is you know we                                 needed a gateway right something going                                 risk so that's where we ended up with is                                 to you because again it's a it's a                                 enterprise right they don't just want                                 knots knots out traffic everybody knows                                 not south east west right not south is                                 traffic coming into your cluster east                                 west is traffic within sort of your data                                 center or your cluster they wanted                                 governance on the east-west traffic as                                 well so a service mesh made sense and                                 we'd been talking to a few you know                                 we've been talking to Google etc and                                 they're like is too is now mature enough                                 that you can really use it right and                                 then we had an SSO provider so a lot of                                 this though is most kind of modeled on                                 the OCP stack it just seemed to make                                 sense the intent I think was always to                                 go to OCP but you know have a maker                                 start and really prove that this is a                                 viable option as well so you have you                                 know you can run a Redis cluster on it                                 you need object storage you can run mini                                 oh we are we are doing that now you can                                 run your services have some world                                 integration for secrets back it up with                                 storage which is a big story I'll get                                 into and then you don't have your                                 logging cabañas e EF K is flown D Zipkin                                 um                                 how many people using Zipkin distributed                                 dressing yeah anybody using Jaeger you                                 know thinks Lipkin is crap and old right                                 I thought so but you know we have we're                                 from a Java background net flix OSS                                 spring cloud etcetera we were fairly                                 comfortable with with Zipkin with                                 running it so then we and I hadn't                                 really looked at yeah girl deeply enough                                 you had to make a call saying we'll go                                 with this but I want to get there now I                                 think yeah and then you know Prometheus                                 and graph Anna which ended up being of                                 gods and saved us a lot of stuff and                                 then a bunch of dashboards because you                                 always want more observability right to                                 give you a sense of when we started                                 containerization wasn't really                                 mainstream I know because I heard those                                 conversations you know certainly in                                 India and a lot of big enterprises                                 weren't really moving to containers yet                                 it's it's it's a big rip lat forming                                 effort this is what we were trying to do                                 here                                 and this is the same same is true for                                 most organizations this is about two                                 years back you know it's not that long                                 back OpenShift was you know redhead                                 wasn't IBM yet so I said this statement                                 last week I said ready at was still                                 right at and then away nice gentleman                                 from IBM came up and corrected me said                                 it's still red hat which I know you know                                 it isn't its own individual entity yeah                                 by da Vinci froze on v                                                 really integrated into open shifty-eyed                                 it was its own entity you could get core                                 OS you can't get core OS now you have to                                 go with Frederick or OS or people are                                 saying yes flatcar whatever history was                                 just stabilized I think evasion when I                                 just come out half of you know at least                                 half of the current C&C of projects I                                 don't think they were even an incubation                                 and cube ADM wasn't yet the default in                                 store any people are using cube IDM to                                 do all of their sort of production                                 provisioning do you like it you know is                                 it easy just say yeah um it's nice it's                                 just they're still you know to us they                                 were still enough manual steps needed                                 there if this wasn't the default yet so                                 we had some today if I went with it we'd                                 probably relocate it a little bit more                                 closer today the you know just in the                                 last two years so much has changed right                                 everybody here understands what a                                 container is everybody appreciates you                                 need a container Orchestrator kubernetes                                 is the clear winner it was still the                                 clear winner back then though yeah and                                 then you have operators now the whole                                 new world you automate everything                                 there's should be no manual intervention                                 needed you submit your API resource and                                 your CR D gets read and it applies the                                 cluster state I am willing to bet there                                 are at least a few sales people in here                                 know how easy is it to convince                                 enterprises to adopt something                                 completely new and that to open-source                                 community driven stuff how easy is it                                 how did he convince them that's the real                                 reason we are here you know honestly I                                 think so so a lot of effort you know we                                 had to go in and do workshops so                                 convince the people we were working with                                 then convince the people they had to                                 work with then convince the infratry                                 then talk to the security and compliance                                 teams and these guys you know if                                 something goes wrong I'll be I will come                                 and put them in jail or also they say                                 you know fit banks so they have to be                                 really convinced and we had to take a                                 bunch of exceptions nonetheless you know                                 because it's just the way kubernetes                                 works you can only do so much if you                                 were on open shift you know you have                                 some backing with SELinux or a palma or                                 whatever but community communities and                                 like I said we were not really linux                                 experts we built that expertise up so                                 you know we had to convince them about                                 each of the core components and then we                                 did a lot of estimation you know                                 capacity planning etc because really                                 what they wanted was something fairly                                 ambitious something that scaled a lot                                 which means you have to provision all                                 this compute upfront they have to have                                 purchase orders they have to buy all                                 this infra or at least provision it on                                 the VMS but then vm servers are limited                                 by the capacity you have to buy a new vm                                 servers as well you know VMware servers                                 would be so nice to run on the cloud and                                 just scale up whenever you felt like it                                 which means we don't we can't do no                                 daughter scaling for instance you know                                 just auto scaling quadrotor scaling is a                                 limit okay so the journey was I don't                                 know if you guys can see this well                                 enough so the confession I have to make                                 is I did this slide while I was sitting                                 here right before the sessions but but                                 you know this started around July                                      they came to us we had a lot of                                 discussions yeah I don't have a laser                                 pointer sorry so you know I'll just read                                 it out and then around September we'd                                 finally started pitching communities to                                 them we talked to a lot of people then                                 we had to detail out each component give                                 comparison matrixes matrices you know                                 like I said PKS why not open shift or                                 PKS or sure or whatever why why kovin it                                 is and then we had to get architecture                                 approvals right governance approvals and                                 so I will say this for the most part                                 everybody was really thrilled to have                                 that transformation happening it's just                                 that it it takes a little bit of due                                 diligence it takes some effort you know                                 somebody has to come in and be a little                                 bit pushy                                 but everybody's thrilled with new                                 technology in any enterprise their big                                 problem is there's so much inertia they                                 really want to break that and really                                 move fast but it's it's always a                                 challenge to do that once we were past                                 that we started kicking off now we had                                 to give detailed you know sort of                                 hardware specifications right and that                                 that means everything right down to                                 which ports have to be opened where on                                 which fire was because this is heavily                                 regulated so you have to prepare all of                                 that up front ok how many people can                                 predict where a pod is going to be                                 scheduled across eight nodes and unless                                 you put labels on it or whatever can you                                 predict it however you have to give the                                 oit team and architecture diagram saying                                 this server is where this application is                                 going to run this server is where this                                 application is going to run and then I                                 have to go in and convince them I have                                 no idea where it's going to be scheduled                                 it might run on any of these eight yeah                                 but then we finally got everything we                                 needed and then we had your traditional                                 IT scans so they don't like that cubelet                                 or docker Daymond has to run as root                                 they don't want anything to run as root                                 right so a lot of discussion around that                                 but we finally went to production in                                 April two thousand nineteen so not too                                 bad it got a little bit hairy at the end                                 and mind you this is not just kubernetes                                 right we were actually doing application                                 development for them the reason I stress                                 all of this is our platform engineering                                 team was three guys and a development                                 team was about ten so all of them are                                 doing development but these services                                 need to be deployed across multiple                                 environments and they're waiting for us                                 the testers to be set up so yeah little                                 bit of negotiation needed there okay so                                 what were the learnings how am I looking                                 for time I have                                                       yeah so we learned that cloud and on                                 frame are very different beast just                                 because we got kubernetes pods running                                 on AWS and on gke in just because we got                                 containers running on open ship does not                                 mean we were in any way qualified to                                 establish our own kubernetes platform                                 honestly we didn't know what we were                                 getting into and that was the best thing                                 possible because he just went ahead and                                 did it right it's a hummingbird story we                                 did not know storage when we started I                                 can be fairly upfront about it because                                 the the problem is you know I want to                                 just deal with you know I'll give a                                 persistent volume claim and I'll get a                                 persistent volume however the underlying                                 storage you know there's no                                 orchestration there these guys are used                                 to attaching disks manually or okay over                                 the network                                 they had NFS and they themselves didn't                                 recommend are using it because they like                                 we've never quite certified it for                                 production so storage you know I have no                                 idea what I Ops was when I started I had                                 to learn all of these things same with                                 my team networking I knew a little bit                                 but then I had to kind of explain it a                                 little bit to my application developers                                 in the java application developers but                                 that was slightly easier but again I'm                                 not an IT guy you know my knowledge of                                 networking is very different from what                                 the operations team knows so yeah and                                 then again we had to we had to actually                                 understand what exactly is a container                                 you know so I had to start actually go                                 back in and sort of because I had to                                 explain this stuff right what is the C                                 group what is a namespace this is what a                                 container is this is how it runs this is                                 our community schedules it so we had to                                 learn and then you have to run this                                 yourself so what are the processes                                 running on each worker node on the                                 master node you have to actually detail                                 this out very very clearly so we had to                                 learn enough and if a node restarts what                                 are the processes that should not just                                 stated that have to restart along with                                 the node the thing is enterprise IT                                 teams don't like it when you try to                                 circumvent trying to circumvent them but                                 try to run ahead of them right they have                                 their own standards and                                 is the meant to safeguard security they                                 meant to safeguard the jobs as well you                                 know whatever you're doing well risky to                                 them so our goals obviously were to                                 install and operate communities using                                 only community tools right manually on                                 VMs from scratch real Williams no core                                 OS there and then obviously get the                                 DevOps into place sed pipelines figure                                 out governance strategies so that I                                 don't have a big DevOps team this was my                                 team by the way you know it when I say I                                 actually mean I you know I actually                                 leading the initiative which means we                                 have to bring in as much automation and                                 governance as is possible and sort of                                 redeveloped from scratch whatever open                                 ship gives you out of the box and then                                 the sort of govern is to you in a                                 flexible enough mana to govern Israel                                 how many people are using service                                 messages to your link ready a lot more                                 hands in Bangalore last week I actually                                 had a few link ready contributors okay I                                 will take two moments is that fine and                                 then I'll close right so we the                                 learnings were run all processes as                                 docker containers you know no open                                 Internet so you actually have to get all                                 the images into the enterprise docker                                 registry we used cube spray to set up on                                 rel VMs anybody use cube spray no so                                 it's essentially an opinionated wrapper                                 around cube idiom gives you a lot more                                 tooling by it's slightly slow not a big                                 problem for us but use ansible playbooks                                 it sets up the Calico overlay networks                                 etcetera and then we set up some                                 admission control policies and Hellen                                 charts were a big big big of you know                                 offering because all of those components                                 I showed were installed through an                                 charts in case the chart didn't exist we                                 went in and wrote our own and this is                                 sort of the size it's not great for                                 cloud you know into it for instance last                                 week we're running                                                      have about                                                            you know there's an experimentalist out                                 to test out upgrades and then there's an                                 on prod prod and ER and then some of the                                 dashboards we did you know I really like                                 we've scoped I'm not sure that it just                                 looks just so pretty and I'm not sure                                 I've ever figured out how                                 read the information we just looked so                                 pretty but prometheus is a God Zen you                                 know it can monitor is to your                                 performance it can actually monitor our                                 SSO server and you know sort of your                                 java memory utilization everything                                 you'll be tired each of the services to                                 essentially get from it just to scrape                                 their data so very very useful to track                                 memory issues and then you know custom                                 auto scaling we have something called                                 backends for front ends which is                                 essentially Zul gateways from the spring                                 cloud stack they don't a not memory                                 intensive there I owe in tensive so we                                 had to plug in a steer to that sort of                                 scale per connection and then you know                                 timeouts retry as rate-limiting all of                                 that stuff should I close or do I have                                                                                                         idiotic operation problem areas like I                                 said storage orchestration was a pain                                 ultimately we ended up with and if as we                                 tried out cluster anybody's tried out                                 lustre everybody seems to hate it                                 nowadays you know I've talked to a few                                 people it again we're not storage X but                                 sort of operationalizing it proved                                 complicated and was still backed by NFS                                 ultimately we ended up with NFS it's                                 working out fine but now I'm kind of                                 looking at cash and rope rope basically                                 doing the socket storage orchestration                                 from kubernetes itself so looks more                                 promising now helm                                 helm with tiller was super painful                                 thankfully he'll and three is out now                                 but it would it kept blowing up                                 initially until we kind of figured out                                 how to massage it to run nicely you                                 can't really do a lot of dynamic                                 configuration with it it keeps going up                                 but yeah and then you know our prince is                                 tio so it's do configuration give us the                                 most problems especially with TLS we had                                 a lot of problems with sort of                                 connection pooling at the gateway level                                 and then with the certificates we did                                 not you know we can't use sort manager                                 because this is all closed on                                 environment you have to have a purchase                                 order for certificates as well so stuff                                 kind of work stuff sometimes if you has                                 a lot of configuration for a lot of                                 special use cases and sometimes some of                                 them just don't be                                 and traffic stops coming to your cluster                                 so a lot of that so what we learned was                                 you know don't run is kubernetes                                 adoption in front of sort of traditional                                 IT teams you have to work hand in hand                                 and so we learned from a bunch of so you                                 know did restart the CDs node h CD would                                 crash the entire cluster would go down                                 not on production thankfully what sort                                 of on the lower class so we had to kind                                 of work with them to set up a good sort                                 of governance practice out and tell them                                 okay this is when you do this stuff and                                 you let us know and these are the sort                                 of automatic restarts we will set up had                                 to figure out how to sort of work well                                 with the registry which sometimes if it                                 goes down and your image pool policy's                                 always the service goes down right and                                 it hasn't that happened with anybody                                 know okay let's see one end yeah this is                                 sort of you know okay so nine three                                 nines that no comment I guess but I'm                                 hopeful we will get to three nines I                                 think you'll agree it's kind of a                                 challenge but you know we want to kind                                 of the expected peak load is                                       transactions per second we have enough                                 in front so the challenge is more about                                 if things go wrong then we have to                                 recover really fast fine um should I                                 close because nobody's coming to push me                                 off the stage not sure what's okay you                                 guys want me to continue do let me know                                 if I have to run off you know if the                                 next speaker is waiting for me yeah okay                                 you all ready all right so I'll step off                                 I kind of wanted to show this up so we                                 have a Gradle build and that essentially                                 handles the entire build lifecycle                                 Jenkins just calls a braided riddle                                 build so because we we can't afford a                                 lot of overhead grady bootstraps every                                 service and that has all of the                                 operations stuff inbuilt already so                                 essentially you just write the code                                 business logic code and you know sort of                                 your environment specific configuration                                 and it seems to work well enough                                 typically you know like I said there's                                 only like three or four people so you                                 know you have a your you build it you                                 run it mentality you have to then help                                 out with production which is fine                                 startups do that all the time right and                                 insecurity is sort of cube benched
