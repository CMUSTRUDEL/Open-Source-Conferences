Kubernetes Federation for Edge - Vishvesh Vijaywargiy & Madhusudan N, NVIDIA 

What does it take to run Kubernetes at the edge? Running applications on edge devices is a fundamental shift from the cloud native world and this talk explores if Kubernetes is ready for it. We will start by exploring the different shades of the edge through the lens of several use cases: retail store, edge antenas, highways, cars and cargo ships. We will also highlight the challenges that applications and infrastructure faces when running at the edge (NAT boundaries, intermittent connectivity, limited compute resources etc). Finally we will present a kubernetes federation solution that can handle the scale of managing thousands of edge devices. An example deep learning application will be used to demonstrate the solution.
