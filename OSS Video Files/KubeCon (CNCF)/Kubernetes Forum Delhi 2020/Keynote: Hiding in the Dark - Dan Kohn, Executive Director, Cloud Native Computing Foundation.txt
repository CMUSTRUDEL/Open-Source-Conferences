	                              good morning new delhi's and thank you                               yeah glad to have you here so the cloud                               native computing foundation is the                               organization that hosts these open                               source projects and organizes this event                               we also publish the cloud native                               definition quote one of CN CF s-- goals                               is to democratize state-of-the-art                               patterns to make these innovations                                accessible for everyone I'm going to                                share with you a short parable about                                this democratization but first I need to                                introduce my family we live in New York                                City where my wife Julie is a climate                                scientist she couldn't be here this week                                but her climate change forecasting                                startup Jupiter intelligence uses                                kubernetes this is our younger son Ellis                                who's                                                                over here you'll meet him if you pick up                                a t-shirt later he throws a solid                                fastball and our older son Adam who just                                became a teenager and this is our cat                                Kouros when Adam was a seven-year-old                                second grader a bunch of his friends                                started playing Minecraft so I installed                                it on his iPad and a week later I found                                Adam sitting on the couch but with an                                iPad screen instead of book and no                                little brother and with a frightened                                expression like this but the strange                                part was that his iPad screen was black                                why are you staring at a black screen I                                asked I'm hiding from the zombies he                                replied I don't see any zombies I said                                the zombies come out when the Sun sets                                he explained the screen is black he said                                because I'm hiding in a hole in a hill                                you see minecraft might look like this                                during the day but at night the zombies                                come out and my second grader had not                                yet learned any of the ways that he                                might defeat zombies but he had figured                                out that he                                dig a hole with his hands and close it                                in around himself until the screen went                                black                                this story is a metaphor the                                second-grader represents most                                enterprises although kubernetes cross                                the chasm last year the majority of all                                enterprises are still not cloud native                                zombies represent software failures                                specifically anything that can cause                                downtime hiding in a hole represents                                precautionary software practices such as                                long release cycles infrequent                                dependency updates and manual quality                                assurance I want to emphasize that for                                both second-graders and for most                                enterprises they are not acting                                irrationally the zombies are real                                precautionary practices are a reasonable                                response I also want to make clear that                                in comparing enterprises to second                                graders I'm not exempting my own                                organization cm CF is part of the Linux                                Foundation we host software including                                Linux nodejs and let's encrypt and yet                                projects we've undertaken like an                                open-source CEO a bot have been delayed                                the solution for my second grader Adam                                was to arrange for the older sibling of                                a classmate to come over a fourth grader                                and the fourth grader taught us about                                crafting tables you know how when you                                combine software development with                                information technology operations you                                get DevOps well similarly minecraft                                consists of mining and crafting and my                                second grader had figured out how to                                mine all on his own or at least how to                                dig with his arms but he didn't know how                                to craft and crafting is critical to the                                whole game let's take a look at a simple                                crafting example take a pumpkin some                                sugar and an egg and use your crafting                                table to combine them into a pumpkin pie                                yummy but not so useful so let's do a                                more complex example that will help us                                stop zombies chop a tree to get wood                                which you                                form into wood planks and then used to                                make a stick kill a spider using a bow                                and some arrows to get some string now                                dig and gravel to find flint and kill a                                chicken to get a feather and finally                                combine these using a crafting table to                                create a bow and some arrows as long as                                 you ignore the circular dependency error                                 the lesson of Minecraft is that you can                                 take simple things and combine them                                 together into more complex things to                                 build very powerful tools and here at                                 kubernetes forum deli we're doing the                                 same thing as you probably know                                 kubernetes uses the firewall technology                                 IP tables to manage networking                                 connections between pods IP tables                                 depends of course on Linux and                                 specifically the networking subsystem                                 the first Linux firewall IPFW originated                                 from BSD it was soon replaced with IPFW                                 ADM the Internet Protocol firewall                                 administrator which was more complete                                 and easier to use                                 this was reimplemented as IP chains                                 which was superseded by IP tables as                                 part of the net filter system it is now                                 being reimplemented using EBP eff                                 extended berkeley packet filter which                                 has an awesome logo so firewalls are a                                 core building block of kubernetes that                                 have been crafted into more advanced                                 forms over time but so are C groups and                                 the domain name system and the raft                                 distributed consensus algorithm                                 implemented in @cd in fact kubernetes is                                 built on hundreds of foundational                                 technologies that have been combined                                 together but go a step further and that                                 kubernetes itself is like a crafting                                 table it is a kind of alchemy that turns                                 simpler things into more powerful ones                                 kubernetes in short is like minecraft                                 you have all the tools needed to build                                 what you want and even tools to                                 build neutrals but what we construct is                                 up to us finally where do the                                     graders and the                                                  together to share their crafting                                 formulas the answer is kubernetes forums                                 and also cubic on cloud native Connor                                 please raise your hand now if this is                                 the first kubernetes event you've ever                                 attended Oh fantastic                                 about                                                        metaphorical                                                            benefit for the                                                         first after we got educated about                                 crafting my son Adam gave the                                            a cookie no I mean a cookie the                                     graders the metaphorical                                                the audience who can provide assistance                                 to those second graders may find that                                 they are showered with cookies and you                                 know job offers and the second and even                                 more important reason is that the                                     graders will soon enough become fourth                                 graders and our community where                                 democratization is a core value is                                 eagerly looking for people who can                                 contribute new and improved crafting                                 ideas kubernetes is only                                             which means that we are all still in                                 elementary school I look forward to                                 seeing what we will learn from each                                 other thank you very much                                 [Applause]
