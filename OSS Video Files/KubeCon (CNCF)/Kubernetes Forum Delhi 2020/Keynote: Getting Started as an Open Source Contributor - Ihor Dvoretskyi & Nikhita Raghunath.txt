planning contributor events                                 or moderation of a slack instance or                                 you-tube if you are interested in                                 dedicated mentoring we also have                                 programs for it the release team is an                                 excellent excellent model for mentorship                                 we found that release after release so                                 the release team has roles with rural                                 handbooks defining what is required and                                 what are the responsibilities for each                                 role each role has lead who's the mentor                                 and many mentees which who are all the                                 shadows and after like maybe                                        releases you could also become the lead                                 yourself you start out as a shadow and                                 then you eventually become a lead we                                 also have many folks here who work or                                 are member members of the kubernetes                                 release team so you start out as a                                 non-member contributor and then                                 eventually grow up the contributor                                 ladder you will become a member of the                                 kubernetes github organization then                                 you'll become a reviewer while you'll be                                 reviewing PRS then you remain then                                 you'll become an approver where you get                                 to sign off on changes and PRS and then                                 eventually an owner where you will                                 basically be earning sub projects and                                 providing technical leadership to the                                 project so I hope you join us upstream                                 we definitely definitely need lots of
