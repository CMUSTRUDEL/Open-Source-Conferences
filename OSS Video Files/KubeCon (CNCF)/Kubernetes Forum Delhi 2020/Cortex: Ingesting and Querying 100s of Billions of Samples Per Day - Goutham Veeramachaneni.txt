Cortex: Ingesting and Querying 100s of Billions of Samples Per Day - Goutham Veeramachaneni, Grafana Labs 

Prometheus is the popular open-source monitoring system that is easy to use and scales quite well. We will start with a quick introduction of Prometheus and then move on to the problem of building a horizontally scalable, distributed version of Prometheus to handle _infinite_ scale: Cortex. We will look at the architecture, see how it is designed with decoupled ingest and query paths that can be scaled independently. We will start with the original architecture of Cortex, see how it evolved and the bottlenecks and issues we hit that inspired the changes. We will see what the community is working on now and what the future holds for Cortex!
