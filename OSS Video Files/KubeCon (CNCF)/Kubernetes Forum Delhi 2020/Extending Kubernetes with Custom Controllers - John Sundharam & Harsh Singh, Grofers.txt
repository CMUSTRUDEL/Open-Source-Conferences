Extending Kubernetes with Custom Controllers - John Sundharam & Harsh Singh, Grofers

The extensibility of kubernetes has been one of its most alluring aspects. There exists no dearth of knowledge on writing operators or working with CRDs. There does exist however a simpler use case where one wants to add a small feature to an existing object like a service or deployment. In this talk, John Sundharam and Harsh Singh will guide you over how controllers work and how to write a simple and minimal controller using controller-runtime. They'll also show you how these controllers can be used to add functionality to existing kubernetes objects.
