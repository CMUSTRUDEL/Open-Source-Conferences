Noobernetes 102: Get Ready for Production - Neependra Khare, CloudYuga Technologies

Earlier this year at Kubernetes India Day I presented ["Noobernetes 101: Top 10 Questions We Get From New K8s Users"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzY55PPrtI8) along with Karthik Gaekwad], in which we answered top 10 questions newbies have when they start exploring Kubernetes. Once the basics are in place, users would have questions regarding day-2 operations like the following: Networking: Which CNI network driver I should use? Stateful v/s Stateless apps: How to run a stateful workload? Application Packaging: How to package my application? Security: What are some of the security guidelines? Debugging: How to debug, if an application, node or cluster fails? Deployment Pipelines: What are my options to do CI/CD, and how to build a pipeline? Devops concerns: How to set-up logging, monitoring, observability?In this session, I'll answer the above questions.
