Simplifying Windows Runtime and Deployment in Kubernetes - MICHAEL MICHAEL, VMware, Mark Rossetti & Muzz Imam, Microsoft, & Deep Debroy, Docker 

The leaders of SIG-Windows will provide an update on the efforts to bring Windows to Kubernetes. This session will concentrate on presenting new features and capabilities as well as focus on advanced capabilities like ContainerD integration, CSI, Networking, and Cluster API/kubeadm for Windows. Some familiarity with Windows on Kubernetes is required for the in-depth discussion on advanced features that are in the pipeline for Windows. At the end, we will open the floor for Q&A with users and members of the SIG-Windows community, discussing implementation and trade-offs.
