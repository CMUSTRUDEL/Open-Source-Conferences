The Past, Present, and Future of Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi - Alex Ellis, OpenFaaS Ltd 

By now, you’ve surely heard that Kubernetes can be run on a 35 USD credit-card sized computer, but do you know how we got there, where we are today and what’s coming next? Alex has been building clusters with Docker and Raspberry Pis since 2015 and has published dozens of articles, tutorials, and even software tools to support the ecosystem. He recently published “5 years of RPi Docker Clusters” on raspberrypi.org and this talk takes you through the journey. Find out what Apple Silicon and AWS Graviton have in common with this tiny System-on-a-Chip computer - and why they are so important to its future. Learn how you can add support for all of the above devices to your own open source projects. So is an RPi cluster just for gathering dust, getting retweets, and upvotes on Hacker News, or can it also serve a real purpose? Come to this talk and find out, along with live demos.
