What’s in a Name? A WG Naming Deep Dive - Celeste Horgan, Cloud Native Computing Foundation 

WG Naming was formed in June 2020 as a direct response to the Black Lives Matter protests occurring across America. Its goal is to remove harmful and unclear language in the Kubernetes project as completely as possible, and to do so in a way that is portable to other CNCF projects.   This session will be a deep dive into the work that WG Naming is doing for the Kubernetes and broader CNCF communities on the topic of language, looking at how we evaluate language and phrases in the project and beyond, and why that matters.

hello thank you very much for joining us

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,160
um if you are a kubernetes maintainer

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,200
welcome we're happy to see you on this

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
maintainer track

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,639
and if you're joining us from the lf

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,599
inclusive language community meeting

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,080
that happened

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,839
earlier on we are also super excited to

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,600
see you and to go into a bit more detail

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,960
about what we're doing in kubernetes

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,680
to create a space that's more inclusive

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,199
particularly in use of our language my

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,560
name is celeste horgan i'm a senior

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,560
technical writer here at the linux

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,320
foundation and i'm going to take you on

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,960
a deep dive uh

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,399
of what we're doing here in uh working

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,239
group naming

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,079
so um there are four leads for the

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,920
naming working group myself

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,160
with the linux foundation steven

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,800
augustus an engineer with vmware

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,640
zac coralison a technical writer with um

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,280
the linux foundation and jay singer do

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,440
mars

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
an engineering manager with apple and

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
the four of us have come together to

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,199
um achieve one specific goal for the

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,239
kubernetes project

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,000
and that is evaluating the language and

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,160
naming choices within the kubernetes

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,879
project with a specific initial focus of

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,280
replacing

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,520
harmful language with neutral terms

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,360
whenever possible

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,040
for the purposes of the naming working

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,680
group what we're defining as

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,960
quote unquote harmful is um language

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,400
that is racist

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,600
sexist homophobic transphobic ableist

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,560
or discriminatory in general against any

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,560
protected or

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,240
historically underrepresented groups

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
particularly within a north american

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,799
context

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,040
big mission so

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,640
this is something that tends to scare a

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,479
lot of engineers

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
particularly when we talk about language

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,920
and renaming features in code

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,320
because it's viewed as not necessarily

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,680
as high value as delivering new features

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
but potentially

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,600
really difficult to actually execute on

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,880
and really really controversial so let's

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,200
let's go into a few

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,240
examples of what we're trying to do with

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,920
the naming group

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,840
working group and why that's important

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,360
so we're going to dive way back into

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,560
kubernetes history

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,959
now so the year is 2016

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,480
and once upon a time slightly before

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,200
general availability of kubernetes

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,480
1.3 i believe there's a feature called

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,520
pet set

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,520
um and if you're like me

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,200
somewhat new to the kubernetes community

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
this might be really confusing to you

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,520
and you might know it as stateful set

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,800
because it was in fact renamed

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,080
before it went generally available um

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,120
and the impetus for that was um

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
this image issue by jimmy cardera which

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,920
i think

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,280
outlines really well in its language um

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,599
why this is something that we're

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,840
interested in doing so let's dive a

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,519
little bit into what jimmy said in his

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,879
issue description

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,319
um the name pet set is derived

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,800
from the common metaphor and

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,200
infrastructure of pets versus cattle

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,840
the pet has personal and emotional value

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,959
to you but the cattle is just a

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,640
commodity

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,200
try to think about how our language

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,120
perpetuates our culture and our beliefs

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,519
in the same way that homophobic or

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,000
racist language was and in some cases

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,440
still

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
is commonplace and accepted in days past

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,879
in the modern world we generally

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,040
recognize that this language

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,920
is unacceptable because it promotes a

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,319
negative world

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,239
view that we have progressed past

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,280
imagine how angry people would be if

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
this feature were called

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,560
wife set and the analogy were wives

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,920
versus

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,879
bar hookups um so i think jimmy did a

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,200
incredible job of describing the value

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,599
of

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,879
names and why we need to care about them

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,599
in our code

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,080
um here and he he breaks it out into two

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,480
pieces

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,080
really well the first is this idea of

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,280
using a metaphor

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,879
um metaphors are very powerful things

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
but they're also very culturally

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,720
specific

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
how i treat my pet may not be how you

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
treat your plant

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,319
and there are cultures where having pets

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,640
is not necessarily as commonplace or

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,000
where

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,080
pets serve a very specific purpose

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,799
aside from enjoyment and emotional

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
attachment

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,920
so the first thing that we need to

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,959
address with this idea of pet set versus

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,160
stateful set

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,160
is whether a metaphor is something we

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,479
actually want to be using in our code

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,080
and

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,919
from my perspective as a technical

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,160
writer the answer is no

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,840
um the second is maybe the more

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,160
important bit which is

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,160
the fact that our language perpetuates

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,520
our cultures and our beliefs

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,600
um the kubernetes community is quite

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,680
large um a typical kind of in-person

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,840
coup con runs about 10 000 people and

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,840
there are two or three of those a year

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,840
um which means we have a reach of about

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,199
30 000 people and that's the bare

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,720
minimum those are the people who can

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,479
show up to a convention

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,800
um the contributor community is about

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,199
700 people large and that's another huge

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
huge community in comparison to many

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,320
open source projects

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,120
we have an incredible ability but also

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,680
burden

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,039
to develop specific kinds of culture and

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
we need to be very very

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,120
mindful about what kind of culture we

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,080
are trying to create and perpetuate

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,000
and whether we really want to carry

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
things from our past either as

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,720
technologists or as people

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,320
into our presence and our future and

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,360
language is one of the ways that we

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,440
carry these things um

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,680
so i think i think jimmy did a great job

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,080
describing that there

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,000
but let's look at another example so now

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,560
the year is 2017 and

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
we have an issue uh in kubernetes

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,080
website

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,919
about renaming master components to a

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,680
more inclusive synonym

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,840
so this is something that's on a lot of

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,440
people's minds right now

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,520
in response to the black lives matter

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,880
protests that began in america

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,240
in june 29 2020 um

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,080
but i think it's important to note that

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,919
this has been on some people's minds for

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,000
a really long time now

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:05,840
um and we can bring up another example

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,360
from last year about

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,360
in kubernetes we've chosen to use the

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
word control plane over master

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
but we're not super consistent about

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,080
that yet

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,479
but i think the point that i'm trying to

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,080
make here is um

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,319
this is something that's come up in our

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,080
community again and again and again

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
and when something comes up again and

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
again and again it's usually

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,919
a good idea to do something about it

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,960
which is why we decided to form this

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,240
working group

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,400
um the kubernetes community is a super

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,720
positive place but

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,240
it's also would be good if we stopped

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
pouring energy into this

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,840
repeatedly over the years by taking a

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520
stance saying

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,280
this is what we recommend instead of

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,400
using these controversial terms

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,240
and then moving forward um

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,800
i think the other thing to note is this

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,160
was definitely a working group that was

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,080
formed from that need to do something

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
that i think all of us felt in june and

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,520
july of 2020

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,919
um because silence is violent as the

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,120
sign

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,240
says and i think we all felt

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,440
a great need to do something positive in

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,960
our communities

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,400
um to support people um

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,800
who are otherwise underrepresented

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
so so what is the working group naming

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,199
um actually

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,520
doing um

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,880
the working group naming's formal

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,919
deliverable is

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,160
to create recommendations for replacing

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,199
problematic language in the kubernetes

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,720
project from there

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,360
there's a handoff process of

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,520
recommendations to steering and steering

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,759
kind of enables those to be implemented

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,800
by the different cigs involved by

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,960
giving their their approval as well um

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,599
the other thing that we looked at doing

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,440
um with the kubernetes project was

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,400
creating a framework by which we could

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
evaluate

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,960
language um going forward and creating a

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,720
process by which

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,240
when a term was identified that we

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
didn't like um

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,919
the community could handle it without

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,120
necessarily needing a working group

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,319
our goal in a lot of ways is to disband

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,560
um so

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,520
on that last point let's um talk a

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,160
little bit

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,319
about how we evaluate language because

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,120
this was something that we ran into

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,160
um in the kubernetes community very

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
early on

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,440
um and something that we spent a lot of

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,440
time

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
working on initially so

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,320
something we found a gap in when we

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,720
began this work in kubernetes

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,399
was um the lack of a way of evaluating

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,920
language

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,440
um lots of different projects and

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,440
different companies were addressing

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,279
words like master slave and blacklist

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,560
whitelist

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:58,240
some were going a little bit more

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,160
broadly in addressing terms like man in

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,920
the middle attack or being grandfathered

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,279
into a situation

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,440
um but it didn't seem like there was a

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,560
rigorous way of evaluating a piece of

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,240
language

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,920
these terms were kind of coming up out

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,560
of the ether out of conversations that

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,160
had begun

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,640
three or four years ago as we saw

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,640
earlier

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,399
but we weren't able to look reflectively

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,959
at our own work

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,640
we were just sort of accepting terms

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,080
that were floating around and we wanted

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,279
to do better so we

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,320
um defined a framework for ourselves um

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,000
for evaluating language you can find the

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,760
full framework in the kubernetes

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
community repository under the working

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,880
group

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
naming's documents we do intend it to be

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,240
something

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,600
that people can use and people can share

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,800
um

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,360
but we broke it down into three sections

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,320
uh the first were what we called first

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,279
order concerns

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,000
um the second and third order concerns

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,839
as well

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,839
um so the first sort of concerns were

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,600
language where harm was egregious

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,839
overt and very clearly problematic um

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
second order concerns were language were

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,640
which was problematic but had a

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,160
less definite impact and third order

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,040
concerns were language that could use

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,959
improvement but

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,959
weren't doing demonstratable harm

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,279
so you have a set of questions for each

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,880
of these orders of concerns

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,760
and our our use case is that you

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,360
have a term under evaluation and you run

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,440
through the set of questions

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,279
for the term um the more yeses you have

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,000
the more likely it is something that you

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,399
need to consider changing

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,200
but the concerns are categorized for a

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,880
reason

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
and that reason is that first order

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,120
concerns are significantly

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
more harmful than third order concerns

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,880
so even if you only have one first order

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,200
concern that you've checked yes to and

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,320
nothing else is a yes we would still

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
recommend

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,000
putting more weight to those first order

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,640
concerns and slightly more weight to

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,600
those second order concerns

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,480
and running the evaluation that way um

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,480
we are intentionally non-prescriptive

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,440
in um in how many yeses or no's you

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,440
might need from

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,440
first or second or third order concerns

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,320
because we don't want this to become

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,360
a system that can be gained and we don't

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,079
want it to become

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,360
a rigid rubric that's never going to

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,320
work for language

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,920
so really it's a set of questions to ask

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
yourself about a term

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,839
um and as a general rule the more

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,079
guesses you have

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,200
more harm the term may be doing but

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,920
there are

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,320
some harm is more important than others

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,640
so um let's run through those concerns

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,360
really quickly uh and we'll we'll give a

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,800
few examples for each okay

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,120
so first order concerns are

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,839
characterized by being overt

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
um regardless of the context whether it

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,800
is technological or non-technological

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,760
these are

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,279
terms which clearly imbue harm

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,200
the second thing that first order

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,240
concerns are kind of characterized by

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,279
is they are very specific to an identity

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,519
so you can attach

00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,399
there's meaning in the term that is very

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,399
specific

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,399
to specific people um

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,240
and the questions we ask ourselves to

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,240
clarify um

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
whether something is harmful in a first

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,639
order concern

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:27,120
way is if the term is overtly racist if

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,360
it is overtly sexist transphobic or

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,399
pejorative about a gender identity

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,440
if it is overtly ableist pejorative or

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,680
too nervous this is that to neurodiverse

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,519
or disabled people and if the term is

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,279
overtly homophobic

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:47,279
um so a really good example of a first

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:50,839
order concern is master slave

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,160
where while master potentially has other

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:55,120
connotations

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,360
slave is very clearly racist

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,360
particularly in an american context

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,480
and while kubernetes is an international

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,959
community

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
many of us are based in america and in

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,680
an american context

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,600
a slave means a black person so for us

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,560
this is a first order concern that we

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,200
are answering a huge affirmative to

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:16,639
and something that we feel very strongly

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,839
that we need to address within the

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,120
community

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,200
um so

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,160
second order concerns are things that

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,600
are harmful

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,519
but they're a little less specific um

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,680
and these are characterized in two ways

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,040
typically by a bit more ambiguity in

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,079
terms of language and a

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,440
lack of of specific identity

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,720
so in terms of ambiguity um within

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,839
code and in within some contexts

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,120
outside of code and technology this term

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,760
may not be harmful it's sort of

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,680
a merriam's dictionary definition thing

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,079
where one of the definitions may be a

00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,240
harmful definition but the others are

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:03,519
not as bad and it's hard to say

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,000
what uh what the connotation truly is um

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,760
and the other is lack of a specific

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,440
identity in this regards

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,880
so whereas um first order concerns

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:18,000
were is this racist is this sexist

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,440
is this x is this y um we can't really

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,040
do the same

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,600
um for second order concerns so the two

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,440
terms were the two things we asked

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,240
ourselves for second order concerns

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,040
are whether the term is violent and

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,800
whether the term is militaristic

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,560
um so a good example of a violent term

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
would be kill commands in the unix

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,199
system where

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
it's clearly violent it's not violent

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,600
towards anyone in specific

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,199
um and within unix a kill command has a

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,320
very specific sort of

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:56,839
meaning um of

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:59,519
sort of terminating your process very

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,839
suddenly um

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,360
this has the the potential to make

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,120
people uncomfortable

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:10,639
um but we can't say specifically whom

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,760
um another example of this might be

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,880
master in a non-master slave context so

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,399
master in terms of

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:22,480
main or kind of a template or default

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,639
state like the master key

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,000
there are many uses of the term master

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,680
which are not directly

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,680
about slave owning

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,160
but there's enough ambiguity in that

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,120
language that sometimes it is

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,040
and so therefore within our framework

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,839
this is still something we would flag as

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,240
a yes

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,279
so third order concerns are things which

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,279
are not necessarily harmful in any way

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,480
um but they could still use improvement

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,600
and these are typically

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,160
around the actual language itself

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,079
so is the language clear is this the

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,279
clearest term we could use

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:03,240
um are we making things

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,959
uh seem human that aren't human or

00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,079
anthropomorphizing them is what we call

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,880
them in writing

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,800
um and is the term idiomatic and an

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,040
idiom is typically something that

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,880
wouldn't translate very well to another

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,720
language because it has very specific

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,000
cultural connotations

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,240
um so the two terms or the two questions

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,920
that we uh think of in this regards are

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,040
is the term evocative rather than

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:29,839
descriptive and is the term ambiguous

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,040
um and petsat versus staple set is a

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,440
great example

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,600
of a term which is evocative but not

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,079
necessarily descriptive

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:44,079
pet set has meaning to us emotionally

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:47,199
versus stateful set which describes

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,120
what the component actually does

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,639
and from a writing perspective from a

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,240
perspective of working in an

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,560
international community where we

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,959
translate our documentation

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,639
we want the descriptive name because

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,240
that will translate better

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,720
regardless of somebody's cultural

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,720
background

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:09,600
so once we've run

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,079
through uh the evaluation framework for

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,880
a for a term and decided that we'd like

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,039
to replace it

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,880
and propose some replacements um the

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,240
next thing that we like to do

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:22,160
is to record our

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,240
replacements in effectively an

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,360
architectural decision record or adr

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,520
document

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,559
um and we chose this for a couple of

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,720
reasons

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,640
first off we didn't want to just hand a

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,760
list of words that we felt need for

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,360
placing

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,600
off the steering and off to different

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:39,600
cigs

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,440
because we wanted people to be able to

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,960
see the context in which that decision

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,720
was made

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,919
and there's a number of different pieces

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,799
of context that we wanted to capture

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,880
the first was the date and time in which

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,559
we made the decision because

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,960
as as societies progress they typically

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
get

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,080
more empathetic and more accepting

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
and words that we didn't feel need

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,080
replacing

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,480
um in the past in the future we may make

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
it just

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
different decisions so we wanted to

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,919
record the date um

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,600
we wanted to record what our thought

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,039
process was and what our justification

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,320
for making this change was within

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,600
ourselves

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,600
um we wanted to record changes that

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,240
other communities or other open source

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,880
projects

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,480
might be making um to see if we were in

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:29,360
alignment or if we needed to go in a

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,280
different direction for our own purposes

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,760
and we wanted to record who what

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,720
stakeholder sigs we were identifying

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:39,200
as potentially um receiving the

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,440
downstream effects of this decision

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
um so this is our first recommendation

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,559
that's been formalized

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
for changing master to control plane

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,919
across the project

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,200
and a big thanks to aaron krickenberger

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,280
for pr in this

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,640
um just a few days ago at the time of

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,640
recording

00:18:52,640 --> 00:19:00,160
um so

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,039
we have an approval workflow for um

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
changes that go through uh it's pretty

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,880
simple

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,640
first off we like it when people propose

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,919
changes via the mailing list

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,080
first and we'll go over where that

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,039
mailing list location is later on this

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,080
video

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,760
um our in our experience uh

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,440
conversations about wording tend to get

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
very long-winded very quickly

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,960
and the mailing list is a great way of

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,960
doing this asynchronously and allowing

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,919
that discussion to fully spin out in a

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,840
way that everybody is comfortable with

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,520
the second is once things have been

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,360
discussed on the mailing list we like to

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,559
formalize whether or not we'd like to

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,760
make a recommendation

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,679
through our weekly meetings this is

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,000
effectively a pre-approval step

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
um and once things have been discussed

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,600
for a few days or a few weeks on the

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,880
mailing list bring it to the meetings we

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,640
meet once a month currently

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,440
we're thinking of bumping it up to twice

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,039
a month um

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,640
so the next thing we like people to do

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,360
is just as erin's done

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,400
for master and control plane uh is to

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
open up a pr

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,760
in kubernetes communities working group

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
naming

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,159
directory um there is a template

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,159
available for making recommendations

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,200
and for the reasons discussed earlier we

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,919
like if you follow it

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,360
and the final thing that we do is commit

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,120
that change and once the change is

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
committed that effectively means a few

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,280
things

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,880
first off that you have the working

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
group naming's

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
leads permission that we agree with this

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,120
change

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,200
second off that if we feel that we

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,200
needed to bring in other stakeholders

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,520
uh to approve that decision you have

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,679
those stakeholders approval and

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,280
tacit kind of agreement to do the work

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,480
and third that this is something that we

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,480
can hand off to steering

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,360
other sigs and working groups are a part

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,000
of the approval process typically

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,159
because some sigs are more heavily

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,280
affected by a certain change than others

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,280
for example when changing

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
blacklist whitelist to allow list deny

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,480
list

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,520
if there are visible api methods

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,760
available api

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
machinery needs to be involved because

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,320
that does constitute a breaking change

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
and we need to

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,480
start moving through the deprecation

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,480
policy for that

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,679
so by way of wrapping up

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,799
i mentioned this earlier in the talk but

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,000
i think

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:25,440
that it's sometimes a hard sell

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,799
to do this kind of work um because as i

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,000
mentioned sometimes it introduces

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,960
breaking changes

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,640
um sometimes it's very difficult it's

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
really hard to name things

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
in computing as engineers love to remind

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,120
us

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,520
um so why do it and

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,039
i think the answer really comes back to

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,559
intentionally creating

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,320
inclusive communities we're very lucky

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,799
in the kubernetes project in that we

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,280
have a very diverse very accepting very

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,000
open community

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,760
but i think as the project moves forward

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,799
in maturity it's important to remember

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,600
that there were very

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:04,799
key actors and very strong actors who

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,880
did this intentionally

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,559
kubernetes did not become what it is as

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,760
a community overnight

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:14,000
and without intentional action and

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,880
it's intentional action that continues

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,520
to protect that community going forward

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,400
um and addressing the kinds of words

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,559
that we use

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,400
in our computing is something that

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,320
will continue to protect the community

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,400
going forward so it's very very

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,200
important to do

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,000
um so hopefully this all sounds great uh

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,360
and a way

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
now let's talk about kind of ways that

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,080
you can get involved so first off

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,880
join us on kubernetes slack and in

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,320
working group

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,520
naming um join our mailing list

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,360
uh where you can find the actual

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,480
discussions happening and the decisions

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,880
being made

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,600
um if you join the mailing list you'll

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,240
get a

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,000
meeting invite to our monthly meeting

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,559
that is currently set for the second of

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,480
monday

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:04,480
every month at 10 30 pacific time um

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,240
and as a final note and this is i think

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,960
very particular to the people joining us

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,960
from the

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,120
lf naming group um please take the work

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,520
that we've committed to kubernetes

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,080
community working group naming

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,159
and using your own organizations i think

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,200
one of the coolest things about open

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,440
source is that

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,440
everything we do is publicly available

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,520
nothing is behind a firewall it's free

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,720
for anyone to use and remix

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,559
um and we a part of the reason that we

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,880
made the decisions to do things like

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:36,320
architectural decision records to create

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,080
a framework

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,000
um and was because we wanted people to

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,559
be able to use this as a resource

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,520
um something that we've noticed is that

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,039
there are a lot of different

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,799
organizations and groups

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,640
and open source projects trying to do

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,000
this work all at once

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
um and not necessarily consulting each

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,360
other

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,960
um so we're really hoping that what we

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,480
create can also be a resource going

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,159
forward for people so that they don't

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,320
have to reinvent the wheel every single

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,520
time this conversation comes up

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,919
um and on that note thank you so much

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,880
for

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,360
attending it was lovely to virtually see

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
you

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,279
and what would make me even happier is

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,559
if you join us for a q a session

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,679
after this talk um i really look forward

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,600
to chatting with all of you

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,600
