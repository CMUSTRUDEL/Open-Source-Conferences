Building a Global Supercomputer with Virtual Kubelet - Dmitry Mishin, University of California San Diego & Adrien Trouillaud, Admiralty 

Nautilus is a global Kubernetes cluster, product of the Pacific Research Platform (PRP) project at The University of California San Diego (UCSD) and many collaborating campuses. It aggregates compute resources from around the world. While that's impressive, there are issues that a single cluster cannot solve: in this case, decentralized governance. PRP participants delegate the control of some of their compute resources to UCSD. That wouldn't scale to a global network of independent institutions. So PRP, along with peer projects nationwide, decided to adopt Admiralty's open-source multi-cluster scheduler, which allows for decentralized control plane topologies. Dmitry will demo the federation of Nautilus with the clusters of other large scientific networks; Adrien will explain how Admiralty implemented Virtual Kubelet and the Kubernetes scheduler framework to make this possible.
