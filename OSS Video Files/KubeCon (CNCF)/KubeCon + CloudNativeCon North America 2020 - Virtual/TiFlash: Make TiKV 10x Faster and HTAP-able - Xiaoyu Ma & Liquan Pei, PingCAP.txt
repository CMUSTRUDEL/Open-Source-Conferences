TiFlash: Make TiKV 10x Faster and HTAP-able - Xiaoyu Ma & Liquan Pei, PingCAP 

HTAP is a term introduced by Gartner, describing the capability processing both transactional and analytical workload. It is hard to deal with both workload seamlessly in one platform since the storage format of the two is totally different and workload interference is a big issue. This session introduces a new component for TiKV project called TiFlash. It uses a novel way to solve the problem stated above: raft based HTAP architecture. This design makes TiKV 10x faster on analytical workload and provided strong workload isolation strategy.
