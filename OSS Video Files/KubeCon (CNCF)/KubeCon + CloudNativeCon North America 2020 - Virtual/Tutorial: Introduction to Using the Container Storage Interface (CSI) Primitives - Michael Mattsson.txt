Tutorial: Introduction to Using the Container Storage Interface (CSI) Primitives - Michael Mattsson, HPE  

The Container Storage Interface (CSI) does not only allow dynamic provisioning of Persistent Volumes from various vendors. It’s a wealth of new API objects that can perform various data management tasks through kubectl. In this end user focused session we’ll inform ourselves of the current status of CSI capabilities and demonstrate a few pragmatic use case of each individual feature. Learn about inline ephemeral volumes, volume expansion, raw block volumes and volume snapshot classes that will allow cloning and restoring of volumes — all with practical examples that can be broadly applied to many of the backend CSI drivers available. We’ll also discuss the anatomy of the already present primitives, Storage Class, Persistent Volume Claim and Persistent Volume for completeness.
