00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,560
hey there i'm karen chu

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,440
community pm at microsoft azure and cncf

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,880
ambassador

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,880
i'm going to share some tips and tricks

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
with you on attending your first coupon

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,639
and cloudnativecon

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,400
number one make sure to utilize the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,320
schedule page on the event website to

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,240
build out your schedule for each day

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,119
i recommend filtering the sessions by

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,439
tracks or by content experience level

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,720
number two obviously networking is going

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,199
to be a little different this time

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,439
around

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,039
but as a general rule don't just start

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,559
with hello and wait for a response

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,079
before you say anything more

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,520
just go ahead and jump straight into

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,680
what you're looking for and provide as

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
much context as you can early on to help

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
save time for both parties involved

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
number three since this is your first

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,120
time at the event i recommend checking

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,960
out the 101 track

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,640
this track has been especially curated

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,559
for newcomers like yourself

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,480
and there are sessions on all three days

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,399
of the event and if you're looking to

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,000
get more situated with the community

00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,079
you can also check out the community

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,840
track and with that i hope you find

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:10,560
these pointers helpful and i will see

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:10,560
