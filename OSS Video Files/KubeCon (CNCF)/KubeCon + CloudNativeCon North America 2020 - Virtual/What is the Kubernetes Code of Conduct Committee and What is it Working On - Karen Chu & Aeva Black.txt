What is the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee and What is it Working On - Karen Chu & Aeva Black, Microsoft 

The Kubernetes community has its own elected Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) but what exactly does this group do? In this session, we will cover the purpose and scope of the CoCC, introduce the current committee members, and share our progress on public, transparent process documentation as we continue to help build a healthy inclusive open source community.
