What is the Kubernetes Code of Conduct Committee and What is it Working On - Karen Chu & Aeva Black, Microsoft 

The Kubernetes community has its own elected Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) but what exactly does this group do? In this session, we will cover the purpose and scope of the CoCC, introduce the current committee members, and share our progress on public, transparent process documentation as we continue to help build a healthy inclusive open source community.

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,000
are she and her

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,280
let's get started all right so in

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,840
today's session we're going to talk

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,920
about

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,120
the current state of the code of conduct

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,520
committee including

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,719
who our members are what our purpose is

00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,879
what our scope is

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,680
and our plans and progress around

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,960
documentation

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,719
i want to start with a little bit of

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,039
background about the committee and our

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,320
organization and our relationship to

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,079
steering

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,440
there are five members of the committee

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,480
three in addition to

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,120
karen and i and we also have uh tasha

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
and tim

00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,039
at vmware and celeste at the cncf and

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,080
the five of us

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,159
are elected or appointed by steering but

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,760
then given separate powers we don't

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,200
actually report to steering one of the

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
few committees that doesn't

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,479
and this was intentional both of these

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,119
committees

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,880
are um intentionally separate to hold

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,720
each other accountable if that need ever

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,680
were to arise

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,200
um also to note is that no more than two

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,960
members of the code of conduct committee

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
are ever from the same company

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,280
and this avoids a perception of single

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,799
party control it avoids any situation

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,640
where a conflict of interest

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,640
might arise and if one were to arise

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,479
members of this committee do we do

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
recuse ourselves from dealing with data

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,720
and so there's enough of the committee

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,759
still engaged in something even if you

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,600
know let's say something happened

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,399
involving

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
one of the companies

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,079
now our purpose as a committee is to

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,680
provide

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
and support and enforce a

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,000
well-considered viewpoint of what

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,680
constitutes acceptable behavior within a

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,079
community within our community

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,719
and to do this we focus on a restorative

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,320
model

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,160
that believes in the inherent good

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,039
intent of all members of the kubernetes

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,959
community we we also believe that codes

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,239
of conduct in general do not need to be

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
punitive to be effective

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,760
okay so let's talk about the scope of

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,680
the committee here we've mapped out some

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,720
examples of environments that fall

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,680
between official

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,920
and unofficial spaces as well as online

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,879
and

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,480
offline spaces the committee is invested

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,319
in all these different quadrants

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,560
because they may involve community

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,640
members and may affect both the health

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,160
and behavior of the community

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,400
ava do you have some examples you want

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,519
to share thanks karen i'd love to

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,440
so while the obvious spaces online might

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,959
be our github and our slack

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,879
or offline might be things like the

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
linux foundation events the kubernetes

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,480
like kubecon like this

00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,080
there are less obvious ones our podcasts

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
and streams that people run or a

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,560
personal twitter for a sig lead

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,239
or a official meetup or an unofficial

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,319
meetup or even just

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,560
a couple community members gathering

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,239
together at a local coffee shop to hang

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,360
out and talk about what's happening

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
in their working group because all of

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,480
these

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,040
are is filled by members of our

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
community

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,360
acting in kubernetes interest we feel

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
that this is part of what makes our

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,080
space

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,280
safe and welcoming for everybody and

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
especially true

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,040
for folks who are in a leadership

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,400
position in the community

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,760
it's important that they reflect the

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,519
values of the community and make it a

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,519
safe and welcoming space for everybody

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,080
all right next we'll talk about

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,000
committee relationships

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
so depending on the environment

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,040
sometimes we work in conjunction with

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,959
other parties

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,319
where the nexus to communicating with

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,519
all these groups when there's an

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,439
incident or concern

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,879
no matter where in the community it may

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,040
have come from so

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,879
we're often involved in routing helping

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,519
to gather information if needed

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,400
and deciding what actions to take but

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,319
we're often

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
not on the front lines because all these

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,000
bodies are empowered to act in their

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,439
respective domains

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,439
so think of us as tier two support and

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
let's dive a little deeper into each of

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,600
these bodies

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
with sig contributor experience we

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,720
loosely advise them

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,199
on um on why they have questions around

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
like

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,600
cultural aspects so that's something

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,080
we'll work with them on

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,479
with slacking github admins they're the

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,720
frontline admins in their spaces so

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,800
not only do they have the jurisdiction

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
over their spaces they're also the ones

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,400
to perform the administration

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,680
of it and help keep it free from

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,320
spammers and

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
drive by trolling but in rare cases they

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
will reach out to the code of conduct

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,880
committee

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
mostly in gray areas or if there's a

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,040
repeated issue

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,840
and lastly when in-person events are a

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,840
thing again

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,520
the linux foundation event team members

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,680
are the front line admins

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,199
for those spaces because they're legally

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,840
responsible for

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,919
venues for managing event staff hiring

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,840
security et cetera

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,600
nonetheless though we are there for them

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,440
to help provide backup and

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,800
to provide support for the community

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
during face-to-face events

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,600
so what we do to foster an

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,360
inclusive and welcoming environment as

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,800
karen mentioned sometimes we support

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,840
working groups

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,000
but we also support community members

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,600
directly so if you are leading a working

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
group or involved in one and would like

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,240
our input on something you're writing or

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,479
doing or you want to start working with

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
our engagement early on please just

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,360
reach out

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880
but if you feel like an incident has

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,120
happened

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,639
and it's very subjective also please do

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,880
reach out

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,759
what does that mean to say an incident

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,400
happened

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,319
well if any series of interactions feels

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,000
non-inclusive or combative or someone

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,039
has an ill intent

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
um you know it's it's subjective

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,800
there isn't really a strict rubric for

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
this we're all human

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,000
and historically we've found that the

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
majority of bad actors

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,039
that we've seen were not actually part

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,039
of our community

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,720
they just showed up like a troll on

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,840
twitter or a troll on github

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,120
to start trouble and while we have found

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
that there are

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,680
generally speaking a very small percent

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,759
but some bad actors in any system

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,000
we don't ask we don't expect anyone in

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,479
the community to distinguish between

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,039
between these if it feels unsafe to do

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,280
so

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,080
we've chosen to take on and accept the

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,080
responsibility

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
of doing that emotional work here to

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,639
differentiate between a legitimate

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,160
concern

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,240
or grievance or folks that might be

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,840
trying to abuse the system or abuse

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,199
and cause harm this space is very

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
nuanced and

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,720
i want to just reiterate that we know

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,199
we're all human we're all trying to do

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,199
our best

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,560
and if non-inclusive behavior seems to

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,520
be happening

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,360
i'm going to talk you through a little

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
bit of what our thought process is and

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,160
how we respond to that

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
we asked ourselves some hard questions

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
to try and understand

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,639
the greater context and what people's

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:10,240
intent was before

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,479
coming to any conclusion or making any

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,560
decision and i'll give two examples both

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,240
happened on github

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
and to karen's point the github admins

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
were the ones that handled these

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,080
initially

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
but both were gray enough that they came

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,240
to our attention

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,479
um in the first example a uh a

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,720
maintainer was perceived as

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,120
sort of over aggressively closing issues

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,199
and the contributor got very upset

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,400
eventually fired off some angry comments

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,400
on github and

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,160
both of them reached out the code of

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,319
conduct committee to say hey something's

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,039
wrong with the person's being bad

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,560
we investigated we talked to both people

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,599
separately we looked at the github

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,039
histories

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,840
and realized that this wasn't an

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,879
intentional harm

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,720
the the automation had over aggressively

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,960
closed things and so the contributor

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
in this case didn't realize that their

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,160
issues were being closed

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,479
not by a human but by a bot

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,720
and their anger was misplaced meanwhile

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,240
the maintainer realized that

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,919
the automation tools they were using

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
were closing more issues than they meant

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,599
to

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
and so they were able to modify the

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,360
tools to better represent the intent

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,879
they wanted in the community

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,039
and i'd say the outcome from this was

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,240
pretty positive yes and feathers were

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,919
ruffled in the beginning

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,960
but both people are still members of the

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,039
community and things improved

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,080
now for a second example uh this

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,759
happened after someone

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,000
just had just joined the community and

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,680
began opening their first couple pr's

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
because of the demographic that they

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,240
represent they got targeted on github

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,360
and someone began posting harassing

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,240
comments on their pr's

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,080
and they were kind of ignoring it at

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,160
first but then it kind of it continued

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
to happen this came to our attention

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,920
and upon looking into this we realized

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,880
that the harassing comments were coming

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
from someone

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,720
who first of all wasn't a real it wasn't

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,760
a regular member of our community

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,080
but they were uh harassing people about

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,000
demographic all over github

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,519
they were just sort of a drive-by troll

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,279
who happened to come into kubernetes

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,120
space and cause trouble here

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,480
and so in that case we did reach out to

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
the github admin team and ask them to

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,440
just block that person from our spaces

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,160
entirely

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600
it's kind of a last resort but um it

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,000
seemed prudent in that space

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,600
in that incident to make our space safer

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,920
for everyone

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,080
all right so let's now discuss providing

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
restorative support for a community and

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,720
focusing on harm reduction

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,080
so our intent is to safeguard and build

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,080
trust in the community

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
and all communications with the code of

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
conduct committee

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
is confidential this is a safe and

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
private space when you come and talk to

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,440
us

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
and what exactly does that mean though

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,519
so with whichever means of

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,600
communications you choose to utilize

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,399
we never disclose to one party what

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,959
another party is said about a situation

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,120
and additionally we seek to verify

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,600
reports without exposing the claimant

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,959
while also avoiding potentially causing

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,920
more emotional distress

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,920
or jeopardy for that matter um

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,079
timeliness is important to all of us

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,000
so when you contact us we'll try to

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,839
provide a response within a day

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,640
and depending on the scenario we may

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,279
which may reach out for more information

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,880
just remember our goal is to find a path

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,519
towards community healing

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,959
and individual growth and punishment is

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,959
really our last resort

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,279
and where can you go to reference all

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,760
this so the committee

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,079
is still fairly young we have a lot to

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:36,079
do but we're committed to updating and

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,560
publishing documentation around our

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,399
goals and standardized processes

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,560
we're hoping that by making everything

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,200
public and transparent the community

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,200
will have

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
clear expectations when it interacts

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
with us so

00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,839
some of the docs that we're working on

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,640
include how we

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,839
receive reports and triage them how we

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,920
handle recusals

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,120
how we handle the logistics of incident

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,200
response

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
educational materials that we can put

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,200
the community to

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,279
and we're hoping to publish transparency

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
reports in the near future

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,880
earlier as i mentioned we also work

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
often

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,240
times with other bodies that deal with

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,720
code of conduct matters

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,079
so we're working on formalizing

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,399
expectations and

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,079
communication channels with these groups

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,720
this effort will also help define our

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,720
scope better

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
so where to find us if and when you need

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,160
to reach us

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,920
you can email conduct kubernetes dot io

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,600
to reach all of us at once

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,320
but if you do want to reach out to us

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,160
individually you can just dm us directly

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,240
on the kubernetes slack

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,760
our job is to be here for the community

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,600
so as we mentioned

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,440
you should get an initial response back

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,440
within 24 hours of reaching out

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,880
now if you are a sig lead or working

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,959
group lead or involved in those

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
like i said by all means reach out you

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,600
can get engaged with us

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,639
directly and early on um and if

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,639
you uh

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
we want everyone to feel safe bringing

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,040
their whole and authentic self here so

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,399
if you feel like something is off or

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,760
something is wrong

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,160
please reach out please know that also

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,760
our our work happens mostly behind the

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
scenes so you may not really see it

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,839
until we get

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,240
get all of our processes matured enough

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
to create transparency reports

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,600
you might not see what we're doing in

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
the community unless you're

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
in one of those six or working groups

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,079
working with us but know that we're here

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,279
supporting you thanks for coming to our

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
talk and we'll stick around for some

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839
questions

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
