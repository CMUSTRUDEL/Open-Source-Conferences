Kubernetes: Putting the Focus on Upstream Usability with SIG Usability - Tasha Drew, VMware & Gabby Moreno Cesar, IBM 

SIG Usability is the Kubernetes’ community’s newest special interest group. In this presentation we will go over our user research project to better understand end users of Kubernetes and how the upstream project can better serve them. We will also briefly go over and intro to the SIG for people who are interested in getting started as new contributors! We are a very open and friendly group, and encourage people of all skill sets, skill levels, and experience with open source to join us.
