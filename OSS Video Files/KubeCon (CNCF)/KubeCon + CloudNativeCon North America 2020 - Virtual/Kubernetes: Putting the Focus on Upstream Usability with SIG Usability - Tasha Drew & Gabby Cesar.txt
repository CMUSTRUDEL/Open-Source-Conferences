	Don’t miss out! Join us at our upcoming event: KubeCon + CloudNativeCon Europe 2021 Virtual from May 4–7, 2021. Learn more at https://kubecon.io. The conference features presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects. 

Kubernetes: Putting the Focus on Upstream Usability with SIG Usability - Tasha Drew, VMware & Gabby Moreno Cesar, IBM 

SIG Usability is the Kubernetes’ community’s newest special interest group. In this presentation we will go over our user research project to better understand end users of Kubernetes and how the upstream project can better serve them. We will also briefly go over and intro to the SIG for people who are interested in getting started as new contributors! We are a very open and friendly group, and encourage people of all skill sets, skill levels, and experience with open source to join us. You can also check out and join our work by joining our google group, attending our meetings, and/or participating via github.

okay then we'll just go

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,120
hi everybody and welcome to sig

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,960
usability's

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
community update here at kubecon north

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,440
america 2020.

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,320
what we've been focused on is really

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,160
kicking off

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,520
usability over the past year and getting

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,039
some of our first projects off the

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,320
ground and we're excited to be able to

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,400
share with you both

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
what we're doing here at sid usability

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,720
why the kubernetes community has decided

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,439
to kick off sig usability in the first

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,720
place

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,720
and then some of the projects that we're

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
working on as well as how you can find

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,480
us

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,280
in the upstream community and get

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,960
engaged just to introduce myself really

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,800
briefly i'm tasha drew

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,000
i'm the director of product incubation

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,800
at vmware

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,719
and i am the co-chair of sig usability

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,640
and i'm also the co-chair of the working

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,640
group for multi-tenancy and kubernetes

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,600
my name is gabby gabby mirnos caser i'm

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,840
at ibm

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
started contributing to sig usability

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,480
about a year

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,120
ago when it got started and

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,600
i'm a ux designer on the kubernetes

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,600
design team

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,119
i'm carl pearson i am a ux researcher

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,159
formerly

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,799
at red hat and i've been involved with

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,720
the sig

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,720
for about half a year now

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,080
cool so uh when we

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,960
kicked off zig usability it was for a

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,759
very sort of

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,240
uh silly reason initially which was that

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,079
uh

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,920
at vmware we've been working on vsphere

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,799
and kubernetes and we had a bunch of

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,400
icons that we've open sourced as part of

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
a clarity.design

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,759
project and so we were wondering what

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,320
the upstream

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,840
iconography for kubernetes was and if we

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,720
could work with them to have

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,079
upstream icons to figure out like if i'm

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,880
looking at something is it a container

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,520
is it a cluster

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
is it a node uh and then as we sort of

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,600
as i

00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,600
sort of dug through the various mailing

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,920
lists kind of ask my question

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
it started this torrent um on the

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,799
mailing list about how we really

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,520
as a community as an upstream kubernetes

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,479
community

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,080
needed to make usability more of a top

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,800
level focus

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,360
and some so from from that uh we

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
realized

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,360
that we needed to form a special

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,640
interest group which in the kubernetes

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
upstream community

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,120
is how we organize contributions

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,239
basically

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,400
so here we see back in 2019

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,560
uh new stack had a sort of evergreen

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
article about how ux is kubernetes

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
biggest

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,720
short-term challenge we really see from

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,680
people who are adopting kubernetes

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,519
that getting started and understanding

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
how to use the project

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,680
and understanding how to manage life

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,599
cycle and extensions can all be pretty

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,280
confusing

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,519
it additionally here's a study from new

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,680
stack also in 2019

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,519
saying top areas the kubernetes project

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,680
needs to address in 2020

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,879
and we see at the top really two things

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
that can be

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,319
pretty tightly coupled to core usability

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,159
issues which is

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,920
core kubernetes needs to start thinking

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,920
about the administrator

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,959
operational experience of operating

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,800
kubernetes

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,720
and also the developer experience of

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,640
deploying applications and automating

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
their lifecycle on kubernetes

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,239
so from this data and from our own

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,599
experiences

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,280
as creators of kubernetes and as users

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,720
and implementers of kubernetes we

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,799
realized that we really needed to make

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,400
usability a top level concern in the

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,400
upstream community

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,400
to make sure that we were enabling

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680
people to really use kubernetes in the

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,920
way that it could be

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
if it was a little more user friendly

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,000
so where to find us so in the upstream

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,760
community

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
uh the kubernetes community is organized

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,760
into sigs or special interest groups

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,840
um and so currently we have three chairs

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,519
of sig u's ability myself

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,360
gabby and himanshu if you want to engage

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,799
with us what i would really suggest the

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,080
best first step to be

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,319
is to go to google groups so just type

00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,879
groups.google.com

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
in your browser and look up sig dash

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,920
usability

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,319
kubernetes and you'll find our google

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,920
group this is really a mailing list and

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,400
the mailing list is how we organize

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,440
everything such as sending out calendar

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,440
invitations

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
uh having group conversations around

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
various projects we're working on

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,040
sharing links sharing documents so if

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
you're on the google group

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,080
you'll get the invitations to our

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,600
regular meetings you can attend those

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,520
meetings they're open to

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,880
the public uh you'll be able to see our

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,080
meeting minutes you'll be able to see

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,840
our notes you'll be able to see

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,080
links to interesting things that we're

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,520
working on so i really

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,880
i don't want to understand the google

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,520
group because that should really be your

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,600
first step

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,720
if you're like oh this is a cool group

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,919
of people working on things i'm

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,000
interested in i'd like to kind of

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,560
understand maybe start participating

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
google group is really the best uh first

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,720
step

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,479
the other thing i'd like to call out and

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,840
this applies to every google group is

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,400
that when you join the google group you

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,720
will not

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,120
immediately get the calendar invitation

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,680
um there's some lag in the system

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
uh and so just just be patient it may

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,800
take up to five days

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,400
because you know maybe there's a carrier

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,680
pigeon involved in the back end i have

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,280
no idea

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,039
but you will eventually get this

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,880
calendar invitation that will

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,800
allow you to join our regular meetings

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,280
here at sig usability

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,479
um some other places you can find us we

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,120
do have a page

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,240
on the kubernetes sig so we have a repo

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,400
there where we're

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
starting to use the project tracker and

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
highlight some of the work that we're

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
working on

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,800
um and so that's a good spot to kind of

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,600
check out

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,880
then we also post all of our videos to

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,960
youtube

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,320
you'll find these meeting notes the link

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,479
that i posted here

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,240
you'll also have edit access to when you

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,479
join our google group

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,400
and finally there is a kubernetes slack

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
where all of the upstream maintainers

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,479
have various channels for their sig and

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
different organizing functions so you

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,639
can join the kubernetes slack channel

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,120
and then we have a sig usability channel

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,400
there where you can also talk to us

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,000
so tldr join the google group the links

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,919
at the bottom of this page

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,440
we'd love to see you at our meetings and

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,360
we definitely are always

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,680
interested in seeing new ways that

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,280
people seek to address and improve

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,440
upstream projects usability and also

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,319
involve you in some of our projects i'm

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,479
now going to hand

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,680
over to gabby to lead us through

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,600
something that we've been working on

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,639
recently

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
thanks tasha so i'm going to be giving

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,120
an

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,479
overview of one of the projects that we

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,199
have um

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,479
going on we're calling it our jobs to be

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,560
done study

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,919
a little bit of background first just

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
about

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,720
you know my open source contributions um

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,319
i hadn't contributed to open source

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,560
before and so about a year or so

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,800
um you know this opportunity came up so

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,560
usability started

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,960
and i just saw it as a really cool

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:56,160
opportunity to be able to

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,440
do this type of user research as part of

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,400
open source

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,160
and with tasha's help and carl we've

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,000
been able to put together

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
uh this really great team around this

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,280
project um

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,720
the main questions that were that

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,440
jobs3don is

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
kind of trying to answer is one like

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,840
who's using kubernetes

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,720
um but most importantly like for those

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,960
people

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,400
what are they trying to achieve with

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,800
kubernetes

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
um you know kubernetes is the technology

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
but like what are they trying to do

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,919
and you know what other options did they

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,319
consider before deciding on kubernetes

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,319
um

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,759
how did once they do adopt kubernetes

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,800
how do they go about kind of like

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,840
working towards

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,280
um that objective or that goal uh and

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,400
ultimately at the end of this we're

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
trying to

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,240
figure out what are the top

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,000
opportunities for um

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,599
for the open source community to be able

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,080
to improve kubernetes

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,879
and we have a pretty uh good set of

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,319
people here

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:58,479
um myself tasha carl josie from pivotal

00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,160
and then boaz as well

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
for those of you that haven't heard of

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
jobs to be done um

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,599
you know this is kind of like the my

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,560
favorite way of explaining it is that

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,039
people don't want a quarter inch drill a

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,639
drill being the technology they want a

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:16,560
quarter inch hole so you know an example

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,120
of this could be like

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,680
if someone's trying to drill a hole and

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,840
they had an adjustable light saber

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,319
to to do that you know they would buy

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,520
the lightsaber instead of the drill

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,120
so if you focus just completely on

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
building this like perfect quarter inch

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,240
drill you kind of miss the

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,159
the point or the opportunity to be able

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,159
to help somebody just drill that perfect

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,200
quarter inch hole

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,279
so this is a pretty

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,320
industry standard approach and

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,720
methodology

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
um we we just wanted to call out the two

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,760
sources that we've been

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,040
referencing mainly um this book jobs to

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,480
be done by rosenfeld

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,959
media um and then also jobs to be done

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,800
by

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,360
uh tony olwick who um who started the

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,160
the firm stratagem and so they're really

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,279
well known for

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,120
for doing this approach as well

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,200
and just to cover some of the jobs to be

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,760
done uh kind of like standard

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
terminology we have the job the job

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,920
being like you want to

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,200
drill the the quarter inch hole or you

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,440
want to prepare a meal

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
for example um if we took the meal

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
example and

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,839
um kind of like looked at the steps

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
involved into making a meal

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,080
you don't just make a meal like you need

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,959
to go to the grocery store you need to

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,399
um or maybe like do like an online

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,040
service or something like that to figure

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,440
out like

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
first what what are you gonna make then

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
what do you need in order to make it

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,720
um double check that you have the right

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,279
amount of everything

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,120
and then you can make the meal and if

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,000
you like the meal

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,640
you know you may conclude that uh it was

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
a good meal

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
and that you'll make it again or you may

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
decide that

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,600
this was not the best and better luck

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,680
next time

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,640
um but that's kind of like the the

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,560
highest level

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,320
concept behind jobs to be done is that

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
you do your analysis around this job

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,480
the other concept that's important to

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,880
call out is this

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
idea of a desired outcome which again

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,560
goes back to the

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
drill the quarter inch hole not the

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,200
drill

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,279
and so if we take a music example um

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,320
an example here is let's minimize the

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,200
time it takes to get

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,560
songs in the desired order for listening

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,519
and if you kind of like look at this

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,800
statement

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,880
it feels like very specific um and

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,800
the reason is that it is um you know we

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
have um the reason that it's structured

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,360
this way and again this is from jobs to

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,320
be done

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,560
is because um you know after you do

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,959
qualitative interviews to

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,399
to figure out like what's the job what

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,959
are the steps

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,160
um this kind of like informs a survey

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,560
that you send out

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,640
with all these desired outcomes and you

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,399
end up generating maybe like 100

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,240
to 150 of these um and what happens

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,839
is that when you send this survey out

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,279
you ask people

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:12,399
um you know how important is this to you

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,800
uh also how satisfied are you with

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,959
your ability to do it right now and so

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,079
you know you you get people's input on

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,040
these very um

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,920
structured statements and what ends up

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,399
coming out of this

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,760
is this really amazing opportunity

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,360
landscape

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,360
so if you look here um at the little

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,040
at the quadrants you have everything

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,040
from over served

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,320
over served being that people were very

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,839
satisfied

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,519
um and it's not very important so

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,920
probably don't want to focus on that

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,600
but then on the opposite spectrum you

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
have um

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,880
outcomes that are very important to

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,040
people

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,000
and they're not very satisfied with how

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,279
they're done

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,440
today and so what we call those is

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,880
um underserved uh you know it's very

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,519
important to people to be able to do

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,600
these

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,880
they're not satisfied and so you as a

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,519
project or you as a

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,639
community how can you better serve these

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,880
uh and then you have everything in the

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,320
middle which is like mid

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:18,320
importance and mid-satisfaction

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,240
um so what we've done so far

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,680
as far as this process is we're still

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,480
pretty early on

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,560
um but what we have done is we have um

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,279
designed a screening survey

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,959
which we sent out um to collect uh

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,320
basically background information on

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,519
people um people that use kubernetes and

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:42,160
we also included a free forum response

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:44,160
and put in a net promoter score as well

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,600
and we sent this out through the cncf

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,360
twitter

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,040
as a way to both qualify these people

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,800
and just kind of see what their use

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,560
of containers and kubernetes is but also

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,720
um you know for the eight weeks that we

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
ran this survey of the 1800 people that

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,040
responded

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,560
uh 41 of those agreed to be contacted so

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,079
what we're going to be doing next is

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,680
setting up qualitative interviews with

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,800
these people

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,760
but we also wanted to share from the

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,600
survey that we

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,360
that we sent out the data that came back

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
because we also think that this is super

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
interesting

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,440
that talks about a little bit about how

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,399
people use kubernetes and containers and

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,839
so

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,440
with that i'm going to pass it off to

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,440
carl and

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,360
carl is going to take us through the

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,360
analysis that he did on the survey

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,600
thanks gabby so yeah we collected all of

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,839
this data

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,639
to get a background for some of these

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,079
folks that we

00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:44,079
hope to interview down the road um and

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,360
we got people from all over the world

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,440
mainly europe and

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,680
north america but a few people from asia

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,959
australia and south and central america

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,519
as well

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,040
for the organization type we have a lot

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,959
of people that didn't fit into the

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
buckets of consultants or managed

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,120
service providers so we could

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,279
could be any other kind of organization

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,880
had the fewest consultants and

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,680
still a good number of managed service

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,680
providers as well

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,279
and we also looked at people's job

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,560
function in their role so the job

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,120
function is on the left

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,199
and the role is on the right so we

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,959
primarily have software architects

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,279
devops management and back-end

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,720
developers that is kind of the

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,480
the three that are leading the pack

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
there but we did get a really really

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,120
wide spread so we have some things that

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
are

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,560
probably a lot less common when you

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,199
think of kubernetes

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
such as sales or marketing so there are

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,279
a pretty

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,320
pretty wide set of people that responded

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,839
to this although

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,959
most of the people are some of the more

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,680
typical titles that come to mind

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,279
we mostly had individual contributors or

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,279
consultants

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,399
but we still got a good number of

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,800
managers or or directors as well so

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,079
we're hoping that we can talk to people

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,480
that are both in the ic

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,839
roles and and more of the the management

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,839
roles as well when we do these

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,720
interviews

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,040
for the environments that these folks

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,880
had um by far and away

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,560
people were running quite a few machines

00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,120
so our biggest bucket was

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:25,519
uh 5 000 or more machines and that's how

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,120
most people responded so

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,360
a lot of people were in that highest

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,000
bucket uh the ones that were lower are

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,880
kind of

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,399
uh surprisingly evenly spread so if we

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,680
end up running a survey like this again

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,519
i imagine we might um

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,120
you know maybe break it up into five to

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,279
ten thousand and then more than

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
10 000 so people are running a lot of

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,720
machines in their kubernetes

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,000
environments

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,759
for the data center types most people

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,040
are running in public cloud but a lot of

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,800
people are also

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,480
running private cloud or on-premises as

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,240
well for our respondents

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,199
a lot fewer running hybrid cloud um

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,959
and one person wrote in a response bare

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,399
metal cube admin which

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,079
i would imagine would probably end up

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,800
being bucketed with um

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,440
private cloud but yeah mostly public or

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,199
private

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,160
hybrid is definitely there but not as

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,160
strong as the other two

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,440
we also looked at activities so what

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,360
people are actually

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,480
doing with kubernetes when they're

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,839
working in it

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,600
so this sort of teal blue color is when

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,880
people are very involved with the item

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,120
red is when they're somewhat involved

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
and orange is when they're not at all

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,839
involved

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,600
so the things that people were most

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,839
likely to be involved with were

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,000
working with infrastructure resources

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,120
researching evaluating purchasing new

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,399
tech

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,560
monitoring and troubleshooting

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,440
applications managing deployment

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,680
pipelines

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,959
managing a cloud platform developing

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,519
software and

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,360
architecting software people are less

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:56,160
likely to be involved in working with ai

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,160
or machine learning systems and people

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,399
were kind of just somewhat involved with

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,160
managing data processes which i imagine

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,839
is somewhat aligned with the folks that

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,880
actually are working more with the ai

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,880
and ml systems

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,559
and for kubernetes use uh

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,720
it would make sense given who we uh who

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,919
we sampled for this but

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,079
people are currently using kubernetes

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,640
across proof of concept to production

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,520
uh by far and away so it's kind of

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
interesting that

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,640
folks don't really give up on the proof

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
of concept they're still

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,440
trying out new things within kubernetes

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
even when they're running it in

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,360
production

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,840
um a lot of people have

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,039
uh moved past proof of concept for

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,640
future plans which

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,919
means it might be you know somewhat more

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,440
cemented in the way that people are um

00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,480
using kubernetes in their

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,480
in their work environments

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,039
and so we also looked at what resources

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,160
people use to learn

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,640
about kubernetes documentation is very

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,840
very strongly in the lead here

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,080
but everything else also has a good

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,080
showing so these other ones are fairly

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,840
even but twitter is pretty common

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,120
this might be a little biased because we

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,200
did send this out via twitter

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,400
but everything else is again pretty even

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
so people are going everywhere from

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,960
youtube to stack overflow

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,600
a lot of people wrote in other responses

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,600
and

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,200
they were more likely to mention

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,280
specific resources in those other

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,039
comments so maybe like a specific person

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,640
on youtube or a specific book or

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,480
something like that but

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,919
documentation is still definitely the

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,799
leader where people are going to learn

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,799
about kubernetes

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
and finally the net promoter score is

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,520
something we asked about so you've

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,880
probably seen one of these

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,799
um multiple times it's where a company

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,000
will email you or give you a pop-up and

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,559
it'll say how likely are you to

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,120
recommend

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,120
our product to a colleague or friend and

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:00,320
then you answer on a scale of

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,480
0 to 10 10 being more likely to

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,240
to recommend that product so this is a

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,160
really really common

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,280
uh marketing or customer experience

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
measurement to

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,799
gauge general sentiment towards a brand

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,280
or product

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,960
and it's calculated in this way where if

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,799
people answer a nine or ten

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,280
they're called a promoter this is our

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,640
green bucket uh passive is seven or

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,480
eight and that's kind of the middle

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,960
bucket and then detractor

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
is zero to six and the way that you

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,080
calculate this score in the industry

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,400
standard way

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,320
is you kind of throw out the passives

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
you take the percentage of promoters

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,440
and then you subtract the percentage of

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,760
detractors and

00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
you end up with this percentage score

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,039
and so our percentage score that we came

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,400
up with for kubernetes is 62.5

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,400
and the scale actually goes from

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,840
negative 100 to positive 100

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,039
so this is fairly high and considering

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,520
across

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,440
most industries this is actually a super

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,960
super high nps score which is really

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,480
interesting

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,240
we looked in a little bit to see if we

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,320
could find data around

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,600
other open source projects that might

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,720
have been measured in this way but it

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,039
doesn't seem to be

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,559
a very common metric to be used on open

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,039
source projects so we don't know if this

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,960
is

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,799
you know relatively high or low compared

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,039
to other open source projects but

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,480
across the board this is a very very

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,919
high score which shows a lot of

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,840
engagement from

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,840
the people that use kubernetes

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,240
and that's it for the data so i'll give

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,240
it back to gabby thank you

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,320
cool thanks carl um and just to wrap up

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,280
um as far as next steps for us and the

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,520
jobs to be done

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,360
study uh right now we're working on

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,000
setting up user new interviews like we

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
mentioned

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,039
uh from the people that responded to the

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,679
survey

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,039
uh out of that will come you know a lot

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,679
of analysis

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,400
um kind of going back through responses

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,120
and

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,280
extracting out um that job map that i

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,919
showed at the beginning and also

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,600
um understanding what those desired

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,280
outcomes are

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,720
ultimately we'll put all of this in a

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,080
survey

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,039
um and send it out again and after doing

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,799
analysis

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,840
on the results of that survey we'll be

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:14,400
able to generate this like very nice

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,880
opportunity landscape that that i talked

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:22,159
about in the beginning

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,159
uh so with that that's pretty much it

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,440
thank you for uh coming to our talk and

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
let us know if you have any questions

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,760
yeah thanks everybody

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,760
uh and uh we'd love to have so all of

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,520
this data is going to be open sourced

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
uh we look forward to sharing it with

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,720
everyone who's interested

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
um and then if you want to chat more

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,919
about with us about

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
what we're doing and how you can get

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,480
engaged uh definitely

join our slack channel and check out the

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,400
google group and we'd love to chat more

so and we're happy to answer any

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,760
questions people have

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,840
uh in the audience now uh that the chat

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,840
talks over
