How to Effectively Manage Kubernetes in a Regulated Environment - Darien Ford, Capital One 

Kubernetes plays an important role when scaling containerized applications in a highly regulated environment. Capital One understands this first hand, as they will complete a multi-year journey to exit on-prem data centers this year and move to the public cloud. As large enterprises look to shift to cloud architecture, Darien Ford will explain how Kubernetes container orchestration accelerates a safe and effective shift to cloud architecture with both developer experience and enterprise requirements in mind. As network boundaries broaden, he will cover ways container orchestration can help introduce workloads to the cloud while managing application development, testing, deployment and, of course, governance and policy compliance.
