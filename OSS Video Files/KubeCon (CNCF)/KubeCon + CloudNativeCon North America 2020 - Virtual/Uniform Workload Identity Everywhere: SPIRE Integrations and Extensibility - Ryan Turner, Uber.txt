Uniform Workload Identity Everywhere: SPIRE Integrations and Extensibility - Ryan Turner, Uber 

Distributing strong identity securely throughout a production environment often requires integrations with a number of platforms. Learn how SPIRE can be adapted to support production workload identity in heterogeneous infrastructure across a variety of software systems. This talk will cover some examples of different kinds of systems where SPIRE can provide identity and what deep integrations exist in SPIRE today. We’ll also dive into the plugin-based architecture used throughout SPIRE that provides open extensibility points to support the needs of your organization’s bespoke infrastructure and tooling.
