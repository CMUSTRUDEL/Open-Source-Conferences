Introduction to SIG Cluster Lifecycle - Lubomir I. Ivanov, VMware & Justin Santa Barbara, Google 

The Cluster Lifecycle SIG is the Special Interest Group that is responsible for building the user experience for deploying and upgrading Kubernetes clusters. Our mission is examining how we should change Kubernetes to make it easier to operate. Since the group's formation we have focused on creating kubeadm, a streamlined installer tool and building block to simplify the installation and upgrade experience, and building a Cluster API to provide an abstraction of machines across different deployment environments and a common control plane configuration. In this introduction session, we will present the SIG's mission statement, review recent accomplishments, and discuss our future plans, where you are very welcome to contribute to the discussion. We will also focus on how new contributors can get involved in helping shape the future of Kubernetes' cluster lifecycle management.
