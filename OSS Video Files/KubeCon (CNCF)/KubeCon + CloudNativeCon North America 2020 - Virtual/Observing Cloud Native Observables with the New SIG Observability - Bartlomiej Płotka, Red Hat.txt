Observing Cloud Native Observables with the New SIG Observability - Bartlomiej Płotka, Red Hat & Richard Hartmann, Grafana Labs 

This year we founded a brand new SIG to take cloud-native observability forward: Welcome SIG Observability! Consisting of open source project maintainers, standards authors, end-users, and more, we cover a wide range of experience and invite you to join us as well! In this talk, the audience will learn what our goals and objectives are and how anyone can get involved and contribute. We will give you a short history of what we did up to now, what we’re doing right now, and where we want to go in the future.
