Observing Cloud Native Observables with the New SIG Observability - Bartlomiej Płotka, Red Hat & Richard Hartmann, Grafana Labs 

This year we founded a brand new SIG to take cloud-native observability forward: Welcome SIG Observability! Consisting of open source project maintainers, standards authors, end-users, and more, we cover a wide range of experience and invite you to join us as well! In this talk, the audience will learn what our goals and objectives are and how anyone can get involved and contribute. We will give you a short history of what we did up to now, what we’re doing right now, and where we want to go in the future.

hi and welcome to observing cloud native

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,879
observables with the music observability

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,960
which already tells you that

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,880
observability is kind of a buzzword but

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,240
there is some value to it

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm richard i'm bartek

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,320
and we are going to tell you what this

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
is all about sig is a special interest

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,279
group

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
and observability at a very fundamental

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,439
level is about making complex systems

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,439
groggable for humans and that's

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,160
basically what we're working on

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,840
so if we look at our charter it's very

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
much around fostering reviewing and

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,360
growing the ecosystem off and around

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,360
observability

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,920
identifying and reporting gaps within

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,559
the cncs project portfolio

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,000
find establish write down patterns and

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,520
best current practices

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,280
and the current is important because

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,680
things change over time

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,760
educate and inform users about all of

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,160
these without any bias which obviously

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
means

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,600
no vendor lock in a truly vendor-neutral

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,039
venue

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:01,760
for all thought validation and such

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,879
and as a little bit of a test balloon um

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,280
we are doing more

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,240
in in due diligence reports than other

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,760
six

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
where we actually walk through the whole

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,159
due diligence process to take some load

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,560
off of toc

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,400
and one thing which you really really

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,680
really try and do is have a bias for

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,360
action because usually

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,119
um any any new endeavor um

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,200
is always nice and cool and shiny and

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,159
everyone wants to join and we're trying

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,439
very very hard to to actually push for

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,119
actual bias

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:36,079
for actual action and virtual outcomes

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,040
looking at our past activities we

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,200
obviously uh

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,720
chartered ourselves and self-created

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,960
with the blessing of the toc

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,640
and we did already two incubation

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,119
reviews and due diligence

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,479
reports for cortex and thanos both of

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,159
which passed and are now

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,680
in an incubating stage we started

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,000
gathering requirements about

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,240
online learning online analytics

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,159
platforms and analytics

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
and we already explored some overlap

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,560
with ai and ml of course

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
especially in metrics land this is like

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,520
perfect signal for for

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,080
machines to understand and grog and

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,120
also integrate with other projects for

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,120
some knowledge transfer

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
amazing and as you might be already

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,000
aware

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,879
our observability landscape in the cncf

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,920
space is

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,000
already quite quite rich

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,920
in we have kind of different levels of

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
um of project

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,519
stage within the cncf and uh in

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
graduated we have you know fluency which

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,840
is

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,599
related to logging jager which is a

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
tracing system

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,400
prometheus which is the first system

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
that that kind of get into the cncf from

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,040
the observability space

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,760
around metric monitoring

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,319
and then we have you know incubated

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,480
stage

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,000
where we have cortex and tunnels which

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,959
are you know metric um

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,440
kind of metric systems scaling premiums

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,360
and

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,200
those are kind of bolded here because

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,440
those are where kind of moved

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,519
where well thanks to the seek

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
observability kind of movement

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,879
and we are looking to help you know

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,440
other projects to graduate as well and

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,400
join our space we have open tracing

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,400
which uh

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,159
now kind of merged into open telemetry

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,040
but still is incubated project around

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,200
tracing

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,720
and then in sandbox we have you know cow

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,959
smash and litmus

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,360
for for ready to do cows engineering

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,799
and uh yeah please join our you know

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,560
meetings to learn more about them we

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,360
will kind of share knowledge as well

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,159
uh we have open metrics which is um

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,040
essentially

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,480
metric format um kind of exposition uh

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
well-established format

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,720
and protocol around around

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,440
all applications and open telemetry at

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,599
the end which

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,280
which has amazing progress as you could

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,319
see if you're following the twitter or

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
or actions

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,239
um and you know kind of collaborating

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,040
with many many vendors

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,319
and and allowing them to kind of um

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,799
integrating well

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,799
within single simple kind of application

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,760
you can you can put on your

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,120
infrastructure it's kind of amazing um

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,479
so you know

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,799
the observability kind of uh space here

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,759
is

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,680
is very um rich already you can you can

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,360
do a lot just using those projects but

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,160
you know that's not everything right

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,759
there

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,919
we are definitely not done yet with this

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,840
landscape and there might be some

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,919
observability areas that

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
you know are missing uh from this

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,800
landscape or maybe we can integrate

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,440
better with

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,240
right so if you look at the integrations

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,160
or at

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,880
the overlap there is obvious overlap

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,919
between the three golden signals metrics

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,560
logs and traces

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,520
in exactly this order uh basically

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,680
pareto

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,160
principle which that's just the ordering

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,320
of the most bang for your buck

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,919
versus where's the effort you need to

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,600
put in so it usually makes sense to

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,039
start with metrics then go to logging

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
then go to tracing

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,160
that's just kind of the natural

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,680
evolution

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,520
and if i do say so myself one thing

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,880
helped really connect the dots a bit

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,320
um where openmetrics took the

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,320
label based metrics exposition format of

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,360
prometheus and already back in 2015 the

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,000
the intention was to also have logs and

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,400
events

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,520
with the same label based access

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,080
mechanisms

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,280
which with profana loki we have which is

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,720
super nice

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,560
and as was announced uh we're recording

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
this on a tuesday so yesterday of my

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,800
time i don't know by heart when when

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,160
this is

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,639
actually showing um tracing

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,639
based on exemplars what that means is

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:52,720
basically you only have an id

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:55,440
for your traces and nothing else

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
so you come into your traces from

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,680
metrics

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,440
and logs which are relevant to you

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
course they have like high latency or

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,680
there was an error or what have you

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,360
and those obviously carry label sets

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,600
with rich data

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,520
which enables you to actually go to what

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
is interesting to you and then you just

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,440
jump into the trace with the help of an

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
idea and you don't need to have that

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,479
usual needle and haystack problem of of

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,360
tracing

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,800
and personally i think that examples are

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,800
the future for traces

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,039
like absolutely 100 and this is why even

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
back in 2016 openmetrics already had

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,560
support

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,680
four traces which permeated through the

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
prometheus cortex

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,280
thanos and also loki

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
ecosystem and with grafana temple we now

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,520
have something which actually stores

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,160
traces based on on examples

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,440
but there's more we have continuous

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,039
profiling

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,360
where you have an obvious overlap

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,240
between metrics and tracing

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,919
which kind of goes in this direction but

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
where does it sit precisely

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,360
should we have a new project which which

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,000
can actually store those

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,160
or can we make either of the other

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
fields of or groups of solutions work

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,199
for here

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,240
then there's another thing which i think

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,840
is too often overlooked crashdoms

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,560
you can argue that there is somewhere

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,599
sitting in between tracing and logging

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,759
but having informed state about hey

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,880
something actually aborted abnormally

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,000
and this is what

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,599
what its dying gas was i think will be

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,919
useful in the future

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,840
to actually figure out why something

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,000
specifically hit the wall

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,960
but this is just us thinking about those

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
things

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,520
there are certainly other signals and we

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
would love to hear about your thoughts

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,479
around

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,400
what else might be missing here because

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,400
that's that's literally what aesthetic

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,879
is about it is a special interest group

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,879
and we

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,160
highly highly highly recommend and

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,000
invite anyone

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,520
to come to us and actually talk about

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
what you want to see in this space

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,120
yes and there are actually you know much

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,840
more we are

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
doing right now which is on our plate um

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,199
so let's

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
let's quickly go through that um we

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
started you know our

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,919
proper meetings let's say a couple

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,280
months ago

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,639
really so so pretty uh pretty early um

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,120
however we already started kind of a few

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
directions uh here and there and it's

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,400
really about you know

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,520
building this community around

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,639
observability

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,319
to make sure you know everyone um

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,279
can contribute in their of um expertise

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,440
so you know by allocating those kind of

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,959
small working groups and let's say

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,839
some groups that are focusing on one

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,919
area we can um we can just scale and do

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,560
much more better together so

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,600
um examples of things we are doing right

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,200
now we are

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,040
definitely looking forward to just start

00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
you know seek observability strong and

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,839
to learn more about projects and each

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,760
other

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,360
that's why we are planning to have some

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,959
introduction webinars

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,800
we already have some introduction um

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,959
thanks to steve from about open

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,279
telemetry we are planning to

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,480
um i think host litmus project as the

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,279
first first one

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,720
um which will introduce themselves so uh

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,040
we can learn about you know

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,880
their problems each problem each

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,360
project's problems maybe we can

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,480
have uh you know kind of um

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,040
collaboration there

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,320
in terms of um you know integrations and

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:25,040
kind of user experience

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,200
of of of of really any concept of

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,279
maintaining open source product even

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
that is related to observability so

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,240
that's our plan here

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,640
um and uh other aspect

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,240
is you know this lacking of well

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,279
integration between

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,480
a good integration between let's say

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,959
infra infrastructure engineers and big

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,680
data

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,360
analytic analytic engineers um there is

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,560
you know not much you know conversion

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,240
formats and

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,279
api integration towards this connection

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
so um as the first thing we started to

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,720
yeah

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
look on how to get metrics from uh

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,079
how to get metrics from from the

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,360
projects we support like from to use

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,440
thanos cortex and

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,640
get all or like open telemetry and get

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,839
into

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,360
um target file apache arrow you know

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
many many projects from apache

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,839
foundation for example how to integrate

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,560
that

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,120
so yeah we started some poc some cool

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,360
coding but also some

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
user requirements so depending on your

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,240
background you can

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,279
help in many many areas uh next one

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,519
which is kind of

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,360
starting right now we recently had this

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,440
observability rather which was

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
amazing because we you know suddenly

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,680
have more data to understand

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
what is the interest uh regarding the

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,160
projects and the problem space

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,040
however obviously you cannot you know

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,320
easily ask

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,839
people um you might have you know some

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,360
biased information

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,760
based on your connections and that

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,000
that's normal so we are kind of

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,880
starting some effort into making you

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,079
know maybe uh

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,040
improving this this kind of um surveys

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,000
and making them you know easier and and

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,800
actually

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,279
make companies motivated to actually

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
take

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,880
part in those surveys to actually have

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,920
meaningful data that everyone is

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,200
um is trusting right so there is some

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,800
work on that side

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,720
um and last but not the least

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,240
is introduction to observability right

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
like there are lots of questions there

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,839
are people coming to our meeting and

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,600
saying okay i don't know where to start

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,680
i just you know want to improve

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,480
observability in my company how do i

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,839
start

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,320
and there is no good like you know

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,959
starting um

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,560
starting docs or i don't know some index

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,320
that will root you to the particular

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,040
projects or

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,680
materials that explain you um you know

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,760
certain

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
certain problems like for example how do

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,560
i gather metrics when do i switch to

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,800
locks

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,800
uh do i need tracing what is this router

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,120
tracing what is profiling and all of

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,200
those

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
are maybe for some people it's obvious

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,920
but

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,279
sometimes some direction initial

00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
direction is very needed so we are

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,120
looking

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:07,920
um forward into into creating some ways

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,160
of having some maybe a good introduction

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
page that will root to at least um you

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,760
know cncf landscape projects

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,839
um i think it's a good opportunity to

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,200
also collaborate with other sikhs

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:21,279
and to to learn how they share knowledge

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,720
uh in and and have some method in doing

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,440
that so if you want to help

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,760
in this direction uh maybe help us

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,000
writing some some better documentation

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,760
uh maybe you know uh actually write

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,480
better documentation on each of the

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
projects

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,519
and and kind of root and link them

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,040
together in one

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,560
place that would be super amazing and we

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,959
are looking for your ideas

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,760
and feedback and last but not least yeah

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,040
we want to

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,200
um help projects to graduate

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,800
due to further stages we want to make

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,920
sure they are

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,279
well supported well maintained so um we

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,079
are looking into you know uh

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,240
proposals of of getting projects higher

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,560
one particular ideas or like

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,240
proposals we will be working right now

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,560
is open metrics

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
uh we are moving i mean openmetric is

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,639
moving quite fast

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,440
and we are considering you know um yeah

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,240
maybe

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
have some review in terms of incubation

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,600
graduation

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,000
so um all sorts of kind of actions like

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,720
that

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,519
is in our scope uh next i'm bartek i'm

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,480
kind of you know

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,959
a tech lead here and we have richie here

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,200
who is sick a chair we have also matt

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,959
young who is another sister and this is

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
kind of a starting point but we have

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,639
also

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,320
i mean huge amount of amazing people who

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,480
contributed already to our

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,360
sick observability they were on our

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,079
meetings they

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,440
help us with the review and preparation

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,000
of the charter dogs

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,360
and they are part of you know all those

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,279
smaller working

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
in groups and direction we are we are

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,199
creating so

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,720
