Description: 
	Operators are a design pattern made public in 2016 to put operational knowledge in software to communicate and integrate with Kubernetes concepts and APIs. The Operator Framework is an open source toolkit to manage Kubernetes native applications in an automated and scalable way. The Operator Framework takes knowledge previously trapped in the minds of administrators, various shell scripts, or external automation software and transforms them into automated Day-1 and Day-2 activities. Learn of the two main components making up the Operator Framework and whatâ€™s next for this new CNCF Incubated project donated by Red Hat.

	                              hi everyone i'm rob sumski from coreos                               and now red hat                               and i'm thrilled to announce that the                               operator framework is joining the cncf                               as an incubating project                               coreos introduced the operator concept                               in                                                                   the operator framework which is a set of                               tools to help you build                                ship and discover operators operators                                are                                operational procedures and best                                practices that are codified into                                software                                they make automated day two operations                                possible on kubernetes                                and model the complexities of today's                                distributed systems                                for example there isn't a concept of                                data rebalancing inside of kubernetes                                but that can easily be built on top of                                the kubernetes apis with the operator                                framework                                these types of concepts are required for                                running what we call the third wave of                                applications on kubernetes                                that are these really complex                                distributed systems the operator                                framework comes with all the tools                                required to build this software as a                                software developer                                and as a cluster administrator                                everything you need to safely install                                upgrade and manage your operators these                                tools tie into other cncf projects                                like coupe builder helm cuddle and                                popular open source like ansible the                                framework is loosely coupled so if you                                have a testing tool that you like for                                example you can keep using that                                and if you want to build your operator                                outside of the sdk that's totally fine                                you can still run it with the lifecycle                                manager                                the framework has three different                                flavors of sdk today with more to come                                in the future                                they're suitable for all roles to create                                operators from developers that might be                                familiar with helm                                to infrastructure focus engineers that                                maybe use ansible playbooks in their job                                today                                and then full-on distributed systems                                engineers that maybe are very adept at                                client go and other kubernetes tools                                all flavors of the sdk integrate with                                the packaging and testing tools that are                                required to get your operator out to its                                end users                                testing an operator is extremely                                critical and this is why i suggest that                                everybody use one of our sdks or at                                least join our community                                critical the operator functions                                correctly when it's you know                                manipulating these very complex                                applications                                and our experts in the community have                                modeled all types of applications as                                operators                                we can help you save time and avoid some                                bugs plus it's just been really fun to                                see all the projects come through our                                community call                                and help people out now once you've                                written your operator you need to hand                                it off to your colleagues or your                                customers to actually run it                                this is where the lifecycle manager                                comes into play there are actually a lot                                of tricky problems here that you might                                not even know you have yet                                like collision detection for crds                                picture you have a crd that's managing a                                database but then there's another                                operator that wants to also manage that                                database                                no good same thing with like a machine                                learning application                                the lifecycle of the crd itself is also                                important though just going to their v                                 status                                in kubernetes and so the operator                                framework can help you update your                                operator and manage your crd as part of                                that process                                there's too much coming up to cover it                                all but i want to give you a sneak peek                                 at where we're going in                                      first we're moving over to a new bundle                                 format this is how the operators are                                 collected into catalogs and shared                                 between clusters                                 we have a new tool opm which will allow                                 cluster admins to curate that set of                                 operators including for disconnected                                 clusters and last a new operator api is                                 going to land which is a newer simpler                                 way to                                 interact with operators on your cluster                                 for both admins and developers                                 next let's take a deeper look at                                 operators if updating and maintaining                                 containerized applications requires                                 manual processes and regular human                                 intervention                                 then it makes managing applications at                                 scale difficult                                 worse it leaves those systems vulnerable                                 if they are not properly configured or                                 up to date                                 kubernetes operators change this                                 an operator extends kubernetes to                                 streamline and automate installation                                 updates and management of                                 container-based services                                 kubernetes runs and manages                                 containerized software                                 according to your specifications it does                                 this through a control loop that                                 continually checks your cluster to                                 ensure your described ideal state                                 with the right number of instances on                                 the right infrastructure                                 in the right places with the right                                 deployment                                 rollback and failover strategies                                 kubernetes automates most of these tasks                                 for stateless applications                                 but most software isn't stateless                                 an operator is a scalable custom version                                 of this control loop for stateful                                 applications                                 it determines if your application is                                 running correctly according to your                                 instructions                                 and in line with best practices from the                                 experts in running that app                                 if it's not the operator automatically                                 acts to correct it                                 operators also let users interact with a                                 complex application                                 as a single object on the cluster thanks                                 to custom resource definitions                                 or crds users interact with the operator                                 through those objects                                 which expose only the options that make                                 sense for the application                                 an operator can also set a new ideal                                 state                                 when it does it updates the service to                                 that latest version                                 ensuring your system is more secure and                                 up                                 i hope you enjoyed that deeper look i                                 want to invite you to check out the                                 framework
