                          i have the great pleasure to be joined                               by two guests today                               rainier the ceo of teamless and frank                               chief architect at teamless to discuss                               about                                how cloud-native technologies can be                                applied to real life                                rainier hope you're doing fine can you                                tell us a bit more about you and about                                teamless please                                yes uh thank you very much thomas and we                                are very proud to be present here                                uh as a long time partner of uh susan                                so timeless is an enterprise-ready                                blockchain development stack                                which is fully containerized and                                utilizes                                kubernetes and suture gas platform                                for container management great                                thank you for that um i know of a few                                projects where we've been working                                together                                and uh one new skate that i have in mind                                is around edge                                and i mean the edge can be many many                                different things but                                um could you tell us a little bit more                                about the project with the hospital                                that you have it's pretty exciting                                yes sure yeah it is indeed it's a very                                exciting project                                so currently we are integrating our                                blockchain technology                                in a workflow for                                strokeness analysis                                so with brainstrokes every hour that                                doctors are going to treat earlier the                                number of patients                                who will recover without any major                                problem increases by                                                specific use case that we are now doing                                is to build a distributed artificial                                intelligence system                                where basically the ai engine runs                                locally in the in the various hospitals                                that are working together in the chain                                so our blockchain is used to                                securely share the outcomes of                                the learnings with all the other                                participants in                                in the chain so the use case is                                specifically aimed                                in speeding up the analysis of                                brainstorms and                                well when you take a scan a brain scan                                uh                                the photographs so it's it's a stack of                                photograph and it's usually uh                                a few gigabytes big and in the current                                setting                                uh it is sent to us to a central                                point somewhere in the cloud and you can                                imagine that                                this doesn't scale and it creates a                                single point of failure                                so when you have a distributed                                architecture                                it not only speeds up the whole process                                but because of the distributed nature                                it the system is always on so it's it's                                always available                                so i joined blockchain in the box                                concept                                is an important piece of puzzle where we                                install                                a complete plug-and-play stack in the                                hospitals                                so we are aiming to have the ai come up                                with a treatment device in three minutes                                uh after the scan is taken so this will                                save lives                                it's really great to see such kind of                                use cases and                                the value that it brings not only to                                businesses and companies but also to                                human beings right and yeah and maybe                                that's a                                question more for frank as well but um                                thinking about the needs and those use                                cases what made you                                select some of the cloud native                                technologies                                tell me about why you've made those                                technology decisions                                in the in the architecture please yes                                 so uh yeah when you think of blockchain                                 and blockchain based applications                                 then those require actually to run and                                 manage                                 not just a single node but a whole                                 network of blockchain nodes                                 and even each node and that network                                 is not just one run time or so it is                                 actually a consists of a couple of                                 runtime components                                 so when you look at this from the side                                 the overall network becomes                                 complex pretty fast so in order to                                 develop                                 and set up and even manage such a                                 complex landscape                                 uh we decided to take a                                 cloud native approach which includes                                 containers                                 as well as kubernetes and so                                 using this uh we are now able to set up                                 a complete blockchain network in just a                                 couple of minutes                                 in even in different cloud environments                                 and that is actually what our customers                                 want                                 yeah yeah in cloud environments in the                                 hospitals themselves as well                                 that's that's a great use case thank you                                 again for joining us today                                 thank you thank you thomas thank you                                 thomas thank you
