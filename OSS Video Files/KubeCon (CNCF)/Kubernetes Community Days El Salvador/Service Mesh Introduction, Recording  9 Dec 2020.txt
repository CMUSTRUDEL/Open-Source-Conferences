yeah now it's awesome

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,960
so today's talk will be about service

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,000
mesh and and open source uh so first

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,759
part we'll

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,519
we'll cover what is service machines

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,039
including linkedin and then we'll we'll

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,480
cover about open source and how you can

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,920
get involved and and

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,760
along with my experiences uh so first

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
what is the need of a service mesh so

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,680
okay uh so my name is saran

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,399
uh previously i was an intern with cncf

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,000
uh

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,239
before that i did my google summer of

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
code which yeah with lingard a project

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,840
itself

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,920
i mean after both of these internships i

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,719
was able to get a job at point

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,399
who are the primary makers of linkedin

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,920
now i currently work on linkedin which

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,120
is an open source project which is an

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
open source service mesh

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
as a full-time job which is both awesome

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,480
and fun

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,079
so let's get started so what is the

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
what is the need for a service mesh in

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,680
any environment so

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,040
currently with them with the move from

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,280
monolith to

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,280
microservices there is an inherent

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
complexity associated with it right now

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,479
now we are dividing our big monolith

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,560
services into

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,840
multiple microservices like for example

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
in the in the exam

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,000
in the diagram here we will have uh

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,640
we'll have a a microservice for

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,400
newsfeed a microservice for uh so so if

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,119
we consider a social networking platform

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
we'll have in

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,960
microservice for news feed chat

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,200
messaging

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,560
uh friend requests a lot of things right

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,000
now

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,000
this is very useful uh the the break

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,360
the change from monoliths to microsoft

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,040
this is very useful because

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,119
it it allows teams to to proceed

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
independently without having to uh

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,799
without having to have tight

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,000
dependencies between each other each

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,680
microservice can

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
can update independently can scale

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,360
independently and things like that so

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,119
the the benefits are huge even though

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
there is inherent complexity

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,880
service mesh is one way that allows you

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
to manage this complexity

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
the networking side of the networking

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,640
observability and security

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
side of microservices in an efficient

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,959
manner so we'll see how that is done

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,440
so first we'll see the problems in this

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,160
microsoft in in this microservices world

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,160
especially these microservices now can

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,800
be written in any languages like go

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,239
java or whatever now this is possible

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,480
because the api

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,959
is the same it could be grpc it could

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,560
http etc and and

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,319
multiple services written in many

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,280
languages can talk to each other without

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,920
having to

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,680
have any tight dependencies so in this

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
polyglot microsoft as well

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
there are a lot of problems service

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,760
discover

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,959
uh service discovery so how does one

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,000
service recognize whereas where another

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,160
services

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,519
what is the ip or dns essentially

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
because in this microsoft

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
world things are very dynamic like there

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,920
is there is some microsoft

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,879
there is one instance of the microsoft

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
is going down

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,959
one is one instance of the microservices

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,720
i mean coming up etc so there is

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,640
there is a disclaimer there is a

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,920
discovery problem inherently

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,239
uh next obviously secure communication

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,000
uh in a monolith uh there is no there is

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,680
no need for secure communication because

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,599
it is just one binary right one single

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,360
binary where you call one

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,040
one function to another so there is no

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,720
need for security because the boundary

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,519
is inside itself but now with with

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,120
with network now with every now with

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,480
network calls everywhere there is an

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
inherent need for secure

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
security right uh security in transit

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,400
essentially now whenever a service is

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,879
calling another service you need

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,200
you need it to be you you you don't want

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,680
the information to leak to someone to

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
or anything like that right so there is

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,560
a problem of consistent network

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,799
configuration so now we have

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
like hundreds of microservices now how

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,280
do you how do you configure them

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,040
in in an easy manner now there is a

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,640
problem of visibility right like how do

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,000
you see which service is talking to

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,920
which service

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
the latency is the observability and all

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,760
this kind of things

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,720
then there is a problem of reliability

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,599
like uh

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
to have retrace backups etc uh traffic

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:08,720
shaping you can have

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,480
canary deployments right like you can a

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,760
b testing like when the you can have

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,159
multiple versions

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,599
of a micro services and talk and send

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,600
five percent of the request to

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,280
a new version and things like that to

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,040
check before you deploy it fully

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,479
authorization right like you want to

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
authorize which service users with

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,759
service

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
and things like that so this is a photo

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,440
from

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,479
from a blog post by monzo monzo is like

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,880
an international

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,520
banking plan like it's it's a european

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,800
banking

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,720
service i i think uh uh it's

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
this is a real diagram of their

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,199
microservices

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,720
deployment they are 1500 micro services

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,600
each talking to like hundreds of

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,919
different others

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,280
each each dot here is a single micro

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,759
service and you can see

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,639
how complex the whole architecture is

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,400
and how complex it could be for

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
for systems at high scale like you can

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,000
understand uh like monza

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,440
handles a pretty high scale traffic

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,800
especially considering that it's a

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,360
banking platform

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,479
the same problem is with uber too right

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,120
this is a photo

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,560
from a talk from uber as you can see

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,520
they have like thousands of micro

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,039
services

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,360
uh talking to hundreds of different

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,960
other micro services each one talking to

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,120
there is a real problem here right to

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,720
handle them consistently to have a way

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,120
to observe them consistently

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,560
reliability and a lot of things so this

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,720
is where a service mesh

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,160
really shines essentially like having if

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,440
you have if you have like two three

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,560
micro services

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,240
uh you may not need a source on the

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,280
whole secure communication

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,600
things but if you if you

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,800
if you correct for a deployment like

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
this

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
it it becomes very very hard without

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,440
without anything like service mesh

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,960
so we'll see what is those machines a

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,600
service is essentially

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,160
a two components like on the higher

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,400
level

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,479
the control plane and the and the data

00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,000
plane the control plane is a

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,199
set of components that that are useful

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,039
for user interaction and they talk to

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,880
the data plane and configure them

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,960
in some way as the user wants so for

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,840
example if the user wants a specific

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,280
configuration it

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,199
will talk to the control plane through

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,600
the command line or through the api

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,440
the control plane makes sure that that

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
configuration is spread across the data

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
plane

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,400
or does it data plane involved a data

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,080
plane involves a set of proxies

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,120
like for example here we have three

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,919
microservices and in each

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,960
microservice we have we have the proxy

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,120
the proxy

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,280
is is a is a sidecar container

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,720
essentially in the kubernetes world

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,319
the sidecar container uh every request

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,960
that goes into the that one that goes to

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,639
the

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
microservice will have to go through the

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,400
proxy essentially

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
the proxy is like a it's like a security

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,080
gate

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,639
uh it's like a gate to your house like

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
in a

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319
in a layman terms uh whenever you want

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
to you want to you want to get inside

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
the house you want to go through the

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,039
security and then after

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,319
after whenever you want to you want to

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,599
come out of those you want to go through

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,160
the security gate right it's

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,319
the same the proxy acts like it whenever

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,120
a service he wants to talk to a service

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
say

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
it first has to talk to its proxy and

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,880
the proxy

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,800
then talks to the proxy on the other

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,400
side and the proxy then

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
sends the request to services so there

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,800
is essentially an another layer

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,240
of the proxy layer which through which

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,680
the communication happens

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
the control plane makes sure that the

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,240
configuration is sent to all the proxies

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,759
like that so what do you expect from a

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
service mission we saw the problems in

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,840
the

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,280
polyglot services world what do you what

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,759
does the service may solve

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,800
so there are like multiple themes in

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,919
which service

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,120
helps the security you get mtls

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,400
you get mutual tls like here here as in

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,599
the example here

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,960
whenever service c doesn't doesn't have

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:54,479
to encrypt its connection

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,280
it just talks to uh it just tries to

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,039
send the request

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,280
in a normal manner without having to do

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:01,919
encryption or an encryption or anything

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,960
the proxy here updates the request and

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,720
encrypts it

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,479
and then sends the request to other

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,160
proxy which then decrypts it

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,560
and sends to its application so

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,319
essentially the proxy knows about

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
everything the security observability

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,400
side of things you don't have to

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,120
configure your application specifically

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
to do

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,160
uh mtls to do observability and things

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,360
like that

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,800
so we get security out of the box mtls

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,759
cert management rotation and

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,720
authorization

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,680
you get visibility so for each service

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,080
you essentially have

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
some some golden metrics right like like

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
the latency of a service

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,159
so for example if your newsfeed is

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,320
loading slowly you want to

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,479
you could be sure that the microservice

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,720
that is handling when you use feed

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
so latencies are high essentially that

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,560
is the reason and

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,560
and other golden metrics like success

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,720
count errors latencies

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,080
latency distributions right

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,640
and then there is a problem of

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,200
reliability the reliability now

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,120
now as you can see here for each service

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
we essentially have multiple instances

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,000
of the same service right

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,519
in the kubernetes well these are

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,360
essentially parts

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
you have multiple parts so who load

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,040
balances

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,320
through them in in in what manner here

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,480
the proxy can do that

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,560
that too in a very efficient manner than

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,440
you get from from kubernetes essentially

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,920
because in kubernetes it's round robin

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,800
you also get load shading timeouts

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,640
circuit breaking and all these things uh

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,480
you also get traffic shaving

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,839
traffic shaping is essentially routing

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,839
based on header

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
uh blue green deployments like send five

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,600
percent of the traffic to one service

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,120
and other to other you can do a lot of

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,480
things around that you can essentially

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
shape traffic and

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,320
shape traffic on how it moves across

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,880
services

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,720
so linkedin is one service mesh and a

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,120
pretty popular service mesh too

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,839
it's a cncf incubator project just like

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
any other cnc projects like when

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
like other projects like cortex

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,920
prometheus etc it lives in the same

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,399
foundation

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,680
but there are multiple levels for sure

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,920
uh

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,920
yeah it's a pretty active project it is

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,200
very widely used in production at banks

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,920
and a lot of other things

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,560
in a lot of other places we have a slack

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,360
channel

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,519
which is pretty which is pretty pretty

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,040
active like there are a lot of questions

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,480
back and forth between maintainers and

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,560
users so it's pretty awesome that we

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,480
have that connection with users

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,000
it's pretty famous on github and we have

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,000
weekly edge releases and

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,079
we do a stable release every six to

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,720
eight week cadence

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,600
so what does liquidity do the problems

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,519
that i mentioned

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,279
previously essentially solves the

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,079
observability it gives you observability

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,000
out of the box

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,760
you don't have to you don't have to

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
configure your application

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,360
to send some metrics or anything like

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,160
that you can get all this all the golden

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,000
metrics

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,440
right away you also get reliability

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,760
because essentially retries

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,440
timeouts load balancing circuit breaking

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:56,000
etcetera security obviously

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:58,160
you get transparent mtls and everything

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
with all of these features without

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,399
without any additional overhead that is

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,720
the

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,160
main selling point is what i see you get

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
all these features without having to do

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,040
a lot of

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,360
maintenance work for the service mesh

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,360
itself so this is the architecture

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,399
as we said the control plane involves

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,640
some components

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
and the data plane is essentially the

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,600
your applications

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,120
injected with our proxy essentially uh

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,720
here we have multiple controller

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,680
components like public api tab

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,760
destination id

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,200
etc and then the data planes are side of

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,640
things we have your application and the

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,839
proxy here

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:34,000
so how is link link we are getting

00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,320
all these features for sure so how is it

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,800
designed uh

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,800
it so there are some design guidelines

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,560
that we keep in mind whenever we work on

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,600
a feature etcetera

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,760
so we so it is it is zero config

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,440
uh you know you should not configure any

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,240
of your applications or anything like

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
that to get

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,360
linked working it is zero configuration

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,639
you you can run linkedin out of the box

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,600
it is ultra lightweight it uses very

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,079
less memory

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,519
because the proxy is written in rust and

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,480
it uses some of the cutting edge

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,200
technologies

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,639
etc is pretty safe and also pretty

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,959
lightweight

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,000
it's also very simple you to run and

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,040
manage as

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,160
as we saw here the the rust the data

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,399
plane is pretty low on utilization like

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,440
like later like less than 10 mb and also

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,079
the latencies are

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,720
less than one millisecond for p99 just

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,720
the proxy

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,200
uh so what is service discovery and road

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,079
balancing

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,480
uh using service discovery essentially

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,240
map

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
service name to ip addresses like for

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,360
example if a service say wants to talk

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,519
to service b

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,720
it is just ask the proxy i want to talk

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,600
to service b

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,839
it's the proxy's job to to map the

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,120
service names into concrete ip addresses

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,399
that are currently alive

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,120
the ip addresses of the essentially the

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,399
the instances of the service b it's the

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
proxy's job to

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,360
to to map the service name into

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,760
hypothesis and also to load balance them

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,560
uh across these instances it will make

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
sure that

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,959
uh the utilization of multiple instances

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,320
is very nice like for example it will

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:12,000
it will load balance based on the

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,440
latency so that

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
so that you are not sending all your

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,200
requests to a single instance

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,600
right it also upgrades your connection

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,279
from http to http

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,959
this is how you get all the security

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,560
benefits and also you

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:29,440
the http is is faster

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,760
compared to http one obviously so that

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,240
so

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,920
that is how the proxy work you also get

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,680
visibility right as i mentioned uh you

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,079
get per root matrix look the golden

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,360
metrics the latexes of each application

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,279
i think you get a lot of visibility uh

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,959
from from a service mesh you get a graph

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,519
etc

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
i think i spoke a lot let's see a demo

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,680
after this

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
demo we'll see the other side of things

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,199
like like open source and how to get

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,279
involved side of things

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,360
let me show a demo i think i think i

00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,480
have a better

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,880
i'm more of a demo person than here i

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,399
have a kubernetes cluster

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,440
if i if i do cubicle get ports

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,560
you should be able to see that uh you

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,160
should be able to see

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,480
some parts running the system pods

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,120
without any without any other bots as

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,959
you can see

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,639
it is just a plain plain kubernetes

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,480
cluster with no

00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,560
with with nothing installed let us

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,040
install linker d to install linkedin you

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,320
have a

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,360
you have a script that we use

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,600
call and install if you do

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,600
and pass it to sh you get a linkedin

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,440
binary install essentially once you

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,040
once you do that command you have you'll

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,920
you can use link already

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,720
the linkedin cli is installed it you did

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,720
not touch

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,320
your kubernetes cluster yet once you do

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:48,880
that you can do linkedin

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,880
install and and then pipe the output to

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,560
go to cubicle so essentially uh we are

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,560
installing a lot of components now

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,480
for off lingerie the control plane side

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,600
of things as i mentioned now if we do

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,279
a cubicle get parts you can see a lot of

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,639
lot more components

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:11,440
here uh we see we see a lot of

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,680
control plane compress being installed

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,600
the controller destination you also get

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,880
a grafana and prometheus instance out of

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,959
the box to store the

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,959
metrics that we talked about we'll see

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,040
we'll see odd what all those metrics are

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,880
you also get a dashboard tab and a lot

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,600
of things

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:31,360
so let's wait for them uh to initialize

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,040
they are getting initialized so so

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,079
before we do that we'll also see one

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,320
more thing

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:38,240
this uh just like we saw in the slides

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,079
actually

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,480
just like we saw in the slides each

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,839
application should have the proxy right

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,040
essentially i mentioned that

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,440
uh so how do you do that uh here if you

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,120
see

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,880
if you see for linkedin there are

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,360
essentially zero by two

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,959
what is the two here for example here we

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,399
have all one right essentially there is

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,800
a single component for everything

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,399
but for the linguistic components even

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
for the control plane we inject our

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,519
proxy

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,519
so just like your applications even the

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,639
control pin has the proxy injected so

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,040
here the two in

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,800
the two shows that one is the

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,399
application container itself so for

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
example webex center the other is the

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,519
proxy

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,000
we can see that actually so if i do

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,839
linker describe

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,279
ah archibat in the linkedin namespace

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,759
describe deploy

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,199
meant and we'll see the linkedin web

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000
deployment

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,600
we can actually see two containers here

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
now the first container is the web

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,639
container

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,320
this is here it is the dashboard but it

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,160
can be your application

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,560
and then we see another container called

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,399
the proxy this is the linkedin proxy

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,680
that is like a gate into your

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,600
application

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,199
uh into your application to for

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,320
communication into and outside

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:53,279
outside of your application uh

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,079
so i think um they're still being

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,440
initialized

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,279
because i think it's my network

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,240
so as i mentioned like there are two

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:06,000
things the web container

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,480
and the um the web container and the

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,640
proxy container essentially

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,679
uh so they're running right now we also

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,240
have a

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,000
linkedin click command that's made that

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,799
that is run some checks across on the

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,319
cluster and make sure the counter plane

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,240
and checks for all the configuration in

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,799
the control plane to make sure that

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,799
it is ready and works it works and is

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,320
ready

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
uh

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,960
ah this is done so if you do a link

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,760
ready check enough

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
uh everything is positive so we are good

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,039
to go

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,799
so what we do is that i have another

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,960
application now essentially

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,960
i'll show you uh we have uh

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,880
so here we have an emoji vortex sample

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,440
application

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:06,960
now now when we do curl on this on this

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,919
uh curl on this request on this endpoint

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,919
linker dot io

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:16,400
but it is a sample application

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,120
here we have three applications and

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:21,120
we'll see and we'll see how that works

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,720
here we have three applications etc uh

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,360
so we'll apply that to

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,160
our cubic tl essentially so before

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,760
applying that

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,880
all you have to do is that you have to

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,000
pipe that into linkered inject actually

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,000
finger the inject is an other command

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,320
thinker indirect is another command that

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,440
takes you in takes your yaml manifest of

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,160
your application

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,799
and just injects another annotation now

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,880
if you do

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,720
linker to inject we can see it's the

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,720
same ml manifest but

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,200
with an extra annotation called linkedin

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,360
your slash inject enabled

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,600
yeah essentially your application is

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,039
essentially getting another annotation

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,120
which which uh which tells the control

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,200
plane to inject the proxy into it

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,799
so essentially your application does not

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,679
have a proxy here it has a single

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,840
container

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
but because of this annotation being

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
there the controller injects another

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,480
container called the linkedin proxy

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,799
uh the control brain will do that so now

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,520
if we pipe this into

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,559
into cubic fl we essentially we

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
essentially get

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
two containers instead of one as you can

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,600
see here we have two again

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,840
it's uh if we see if we see it if we do

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:34,559
a describe on the pod

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,840
on the application part describe part

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,840
let's do a describe on the mojo auto

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
part

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,640
we see two containers again the moji

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
motor is an application container and

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,679
also a linked

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,760
proxy as you can see we injected the

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,840
proxy into the application into your

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,400
sample application too

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,880
not just a control pin so once that is

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,520
running

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:03,440
so before that runs we'll do a

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,400
uh we'll see we'll see we'll see what

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,720
the what the application is like

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
i'm port forwarding so the application

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,000
is so this

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,280
amplica application is essentially for

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,960
four things actually

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,360
there is a there is a web dashboard

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,440
there is a voting and emoji auto mic

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,880
so this is a microservice application

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,159
example right as i mentioned there are

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
multiple services

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,320
there is vote bot which is which is like

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,960
a simulation of a user

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,679
it keeps voting it keeps voting just to

00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
simulate

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
the whole network right to see how

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,799
things are happening

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,360
it it talks to the web

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,120
web application which then talks to the

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,600
voting and emoji order

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,559
to vote to emojis and also store the

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,799
state

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:50,720
now if we see the application um

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,280
if we open the application localhost

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,679
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,200
you can see a application here we can we

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,360
can go to the dashboard

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,360
and vote for things essentially to

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,559
emojis actually so i'm voting for this

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
you can view the

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,000
leaderboard there are a lot of quotes

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,520
happening because there are lots of

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,480
words because the vote word is the one

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:10,000
voting it's a

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,840
simulation of the user which keeps

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,679
randomly voting on stuff

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,360
now if we vote on other stuff you can

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,720
see the votes have increased

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,200
essentially because it's the word about

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,720
doing our job

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,400
we can we can keep voting and things

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,960
like that so

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,480
now we open the control plane now there

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,840
is another command called linker

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,840
dashboard

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,200
now whenever you do this command you get

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,200
a link at the dashboard

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,240
now if i open the linkedin dashboard

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,200
this is the linkedin dashboard where you

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,039
can manage

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,039
your applications and things like that

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,880
now we'll switch to the emoji voter

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,799
namespace

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,480
and we'll see the deployments here we

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,000
have four deployments

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,280
uh emoji as we saw emoji board etc

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,880
now if i click on the web deployment

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,640
without any configuration your

00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,120
application does not even know that

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,120
there is a

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,880
linkered injector or anything because

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,880
there is a proxy

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,559
you get all this all this information

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,080
right away without doing anything so for

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,400
example here we saw that

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,679
uh there is a word bot that is sending

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
requests into the web

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,880
application and the web deployment is

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,880
talking to voting

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,120
and also to emoji there is also

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,520
prometheus which is just scraping stuff

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,200
so that is also there too and then we

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,640
also have tab

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,039
this is a control plane component so

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
ignore them you only have to consider

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,200
about the vote but the word body is

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,880
talking to them

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,720
which is then talking to voting and

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,640
emoji as you can see without

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,159
with zero application changes right we

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,159
did not do any application change

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,120
because they talk to html

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,120
talk rich tv

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,840
through grpc and everybody understands

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:48,720
that protocol you get all these metrics

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,520
right away what all do we get here you

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,679
also get

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,000
live calls essentially this is a live

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,120
count of the calls happening

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,080
and you can also tap so

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:03,440
if i if if you click on the tab here if

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,360
i click on emoji water and if i do start

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,120
essentially we are seeing all the

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,320
requests happening in live

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,159
so for example here we can see we

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,840
we can consider one of these requests

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,840
here it is it is going from

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,679
so for example if i want to have more

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,400
filters so for example

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,440
i want to see all the requests that are

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
that are

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,400
for the web if i do if i do this

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,720
essentially we are getting all the

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,120
requests that are coming to web

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,960
and going from there so here we can see

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,840
there are requests from

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,880
boardwalk and to voting and other things

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,279
so essentially

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
all all of this you get all of this

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,640
visibility with zero configuration in

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,799
your application how cool is that

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,039
so that's how a service mesh will be

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,360
really helpful to your applications

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,960
with being being without any

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,159
configuration but doing a lot of things

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,000
like here we get uh

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,320
here not only that you can see the

00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,400
success the success count the latencies

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,919
here we can also see the rps

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
the request per second you can see the

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,080
success count 910

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,120
percent of the requests are successful

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,480
because as

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,320
it is also essentially useful for

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,559
debugging right here you can see that

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,520
your web is having only 94 percent of

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,039
the request

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,320
successful what are happening to the

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,760
other other seven percent it's because

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,360
uh you you want to understand the

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,000
problem right and then you can see that

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,679
mojo

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
is all positive emoji service is all

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,600
positive so it's mostly the

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,279
voting deployment that is wrong

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,640
essentially because that is where the

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,120
problem is essentially because you are

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,640
getting a red side so it is very useful

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,039
for debugging you can also

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,279
but you can also open the voting and see

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,640
so see what is wrong here you can see

00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:44,240
because of uh once you open here you can

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,919
also see for each request what is

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,760
happening you can see which requests are

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,120
negative so as you can see

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,039
uh the donut request is the one that is

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,799
failing whenever you vote for donut it

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,440
is failing so it is that easy

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,120
essentially

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,799
with all this with all this

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,480
observability it is that easy to debug

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,799
stuff to understand what is happening in

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,720
your

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:06,480
networking side of things so this is the

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,640
introduction for linkedin there are a

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,080
lot of other things on the reliability

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
side of things etcetera we have great

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,400
documentation and i suggest you to look

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
at

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,840
so next we'll move on to the oss side of

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,799
things

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,039
uh if you have any questions on the on

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,240
the

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,960
on the link side of things feel free to

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,279
feel free to ask them in the in the chat

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,720
or

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,440
or we can do that at the end uh

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,520
before before going into the oss side of

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,480
things uh we also

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:37,679
linked linkard is pretty open source and

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,520
pretty active project

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,880
we have a very active very active

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,400
community slack

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
and all these things we have monthly

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,720
community calls we just

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,080
had a question we just had a comment

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,159
called yesterday too

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,679
that is there so we have we are we have

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,520
mailing lists etc just like any other

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,120
project we are very friendly community

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,200
so if you are interested to contribute

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,720
you are more than welcome to join us

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,559
we are more than help you we are more

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,120
than happy to help you get started

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,880
so let us see what the open source side

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,559
of things so what is cncf essentially

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,520
cmg is a collection of technologies and

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,000
practices

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,600
that are on the cloud side of things

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,320
victor do you have anything

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,440
okay i'll continue no no uh well i have

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,640
a question regarding

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,080
um before you move yeah so the first

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,360
question that i have is like uh

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,360
basically

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,480
if you compare linkery in kerdic with

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,799
another

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,880
service mesh um what are the benefits

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:33,039
what is the major difference to use

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,720
in cardboard so so obviously

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,360
there are a lot of a lot of service

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,919
measures too like

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,559
a lot of them are on y onward based

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,200
essentially

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,840
uh the benefits with linkedin we make

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,919
sure that

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,240
you get all these benefits with zero

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,840
configuration as we saw in the example

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,520
we did not change any of the application

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,240
or we did not even create

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,200
any services or any other crds right all

00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,200
we did was

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,200
just add an annotation to your your

00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,679
deployment and boom you got everything

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,960
right

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,880
out of the box so we focus our focus is

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,200
very much on simplicity

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,880
simplicity and and maintainability we

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,840
don't want you to have like

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,120
a lot of configuration to so that you

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,400
fall into all these errors right

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,000
essentially a lot with a lot of

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,200
flexibility also fall into

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,200
a lot of uh a lot of complexes also

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,240
so we make sure that every feature is

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,320
created in a way

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,360
that works out of the box that is

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,000
maintainable

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,480
and a lot of things and the other

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,799
benefit

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,720
is that the proxy the proxy is written

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,520
in rust and custom made for the service

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
mesh use case

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,600
it is pretty ultra lightweight as you

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,880
saw 10 mb essentially

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,640
because you're putting the proxy

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
everywhere right every application has

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,840
to be injected with the proxy

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,440
it is important that it is ultra

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,000
lightweight and is safe

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,640
so by by writing in rust and using all

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,279
the

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,080
all the cutting edge stuff available the

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,919
uh

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,679
all of those are possible it is ultra

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,600
lightweight safe and secure

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,919
so so that are the so those are the

00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,880
benefits with link early

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,559
yeah actually i was surprised that the

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,320
the proxy was written in grass i didn't

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,120
know that particular thing

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,200
um the other thing is like uh talking

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,039
about the performance or the

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,320
hardware requirements that you need for

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,679
the control plane do you need a lot of

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,520
cpu memory or so so

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,600
so it depends on your environment right

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,919
essentially so so essentially how

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,360
how uh how active are those controller

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,559
components in your cluster so if you

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,480
have like a lot of

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,080
a lot of application services that then

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,679
the control plane obviously will need a

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,559
lot more configuration right lot more

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,480
resources because

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,679
it is processing more requests it is it

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,600
is handling more stuff

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,200
but but uh it is not it is not it is not

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,440
complex that is for sure

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,080
maybe and even on the resources side

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,000
the defaults are the defaults that we

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,559
give are pretty much

00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,679
are pretty much fine unless unless you

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,720
are scaling etc

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,880
we don't have a definite answer but but

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,399
we make sure that it is pretty ultra

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,039
right on the on the control plane side

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,080
of things too

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,159
it is just five other applications with

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,760
with with each one having like 200 mb

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,039
and one for that

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,840
cpu i think got it

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,600
okay uh i don't know if someone else has

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,480
another question and maybe

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,240
you can give a few minutes um the other

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,880
thing that i was thinking about is like

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,640
the major difference between the

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,360
function of the ingress controller like

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,799
and

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,200
with the load balancer that you have

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,520
with the service mesh so i don't know

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,559
yeah great question uh so so the

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,159
difference is that

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,840
english is essentially like an entry

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,080
point into your cluster whereas

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,240
a service mesh helps you in the internal

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,720
internal communication as we saw here

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,320
so as i am calling the communication

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,200
between your services internal to the

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,200
cluster

00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,039
but ingress is like a entry point into

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,320
your cluster it's like an entry point

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,039
for the user

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,399
and then after ingress it's all service

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,000
mesh that takes care of the

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,279
communication after that so english is

00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,840
like an entry point into your cluster

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,520
and then

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,520
for all the internal communication and

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,520
communication across clusters we also do

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,880
multi-cluster we also have multi cluster

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,240
support there you can have services

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,880
talking from one cluster into other

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,039
cluster

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,880
for all this for all the intra inter

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,159
cluster and intra cluster communication

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,520
you would use a service mesh

00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,240
not for the not for the uh

00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,840
entry point uh not for the external

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,120
external communication essentially that

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,080
the user communication

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,200
yeah okay so at the end you are still

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:30,960
using english control

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:34,480
well ingress resources

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,880
interesting all right uh

00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,000
i didn't see any anyone like even with

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,240
ingress

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,919
ingress is only for like the entry point

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,360
right it does not like

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,880
like any service to service

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,279
communication doesn't go through english

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,399
so

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:48,720
so it is all service mentioned yeah yeah

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,200
that's

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,640
that's right yeah that's it's good to

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,360
mention

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,120
okay uh i think that we can continue

00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,559
awesome

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:02,399
thank you uh so so uh so i'm expecting a

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,080
lot of questions here especially because

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,559
i'm more than happy to encourage all of

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,960
you in getting involved in open source

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,480
both in contribution and also usage so

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,279
if you have any questions here i'm more

00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,120
than happy to help

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,880
you don't have to consider you don't

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,640
have to feel bad that it's a beginner

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,000
question i'm more than happy to answer

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,840
any question yeah so so

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,519
cloud native communicate cloud native

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,960
computing foundation is essentially

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,960
a foundation that hosts a lot of

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,360
technologies around the cloud

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,000
native landscape these these

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,240
technologies are

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
available across clouds that is why the

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,760
whole cloud native you don't have to

00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,279
consider a specific cloud etcetera these

00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,960
are available across clouds

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,600
the aps are available across cloud so

00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,519
these are so these technologies help you

00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,799
run your applications in clouds and also

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,159
on-premises not just

00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,240
cloud but the whole the whole in the

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,240
in the deployment and management side of

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,360
things is where

00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,360
the foundation is focused on so

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,120
the the foundation also has a lot of

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,720
programs to

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,480
help you get involved in open source

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,840
essentially both for students and

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,440
non-students we'll see what those

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:11,440
programs are

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,600
uh so so all these pro

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,200
throughout all this even if you're part

00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,480
of any of the program you're essentially

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,720
considered the mentee cncf mentee

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,159
cncf is obviously a very welcoming and

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,159
vibrant

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:25,360
and vibrant community we got kubernetes

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,200
prometheus lingerie

00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,039
and hundreds of other technologies that

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,760
are pretty much productionized etcetera

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,240
so it's a pretty

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,399
awesome foundation with a lot of impact

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,960
and scale

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,399
most of these users like you can say any

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,960
high scale company over

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,559
any of this any of this any of these

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,320
companies and they would have definitely

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,720
deployed something from cncf

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,480
at high scale so and also most of these

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,679
companies also contribute back

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,200
that is it most of these

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,880
maintainers are also pretty much

00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,000
experienced in the coordinated computing

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,799
space and also they know

00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,240
they their stuff it's it's a generalized

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,600
statement but it's pretty too for

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,919
most projects so what are the programs

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,519
there are four programs like four

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,120
programs currently

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:10,559
the google summer of code which is a

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,159
which is a program focus

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,600
for students essentially the google

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,240
summer of code essentially is for

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,559
students

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,919
who wants to get involved in open source

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,200
through through google's

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:21,279
summer of code you can contribute to a

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,039
lot of projects not just cncf there are

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,159
like linux foundation every

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,679
open source foundation i think not

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,320
everybody a lot of overthrows for

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,240
foundation

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,080
a lot of open source organizations

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,360
participate in gsoc

00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,799
so through gsoc google pays students

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,120
to contribute to open just over the

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:41,600
summer so i was selected in

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,120
i was i was i was contributing through

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,399
google summer of course to link thirty

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,960
project itself

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,799
uh it was it was a specific feature that

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,960
i was working on and google pays

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,720
you for contributing to open source the

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,799
money is pretty good

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,279
it is just like any other internship

00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,960
internship and it is pretty

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,039
pretty pretty famous too if you are in

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,559
you also get a nice you also get a lot

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,960
of career opportunities

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,560
uh there is there is google season of

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,440
docs it is specific for documentation

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,679
which is pretty cool

00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,760
like uh we don't give enough importance

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,720
to documentation but documentation is an

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,240
integral part of any project we at

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:21,040
linkedin we try to

00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,440
be as documented as possible uh and if

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,879
you are

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,639
if you are a user who is trying to get

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,000
started to contribution documentation is

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,240
an awesome place to get started

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,760
especially because you know what is

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,200
missing essentially as a user you know

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,159
what is missing in the documentation and

00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,839
you can add that

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,359
so that is a great way to contribute to

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,960
open those foundations and go

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,720
through google through google season of

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,720
those you essentially get paid

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,159
to to contribute documentation but there

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,760
is an application procedure for all

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,119
these programs where you have to

00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,159
apply and get selected to to do that

00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,839
there is also lfx mentorship

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,359
this was called community bridge

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,240
previously through community bridge

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,200
essentially

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,720
uh this is also a fair program you can

00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
contribute open those and this is open

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,040
for everyone

00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,040
you don't have to be a student you can

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,480
be a working professional anyone anyone

00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,680
can participate through the program you

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,839
have to get selected

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,880
for this too and then there is outreachy

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,960
similar program

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,280
similar like like like google summer of

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,200
code etc

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,320
so how do you get started we saw all

00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,800
these programs

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,000
that that will pay you and also we'll

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,960
have here

00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,720
we will have a coordinated period to

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,320
contribute and also a mentor

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,240
to for that but the program is not all

00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,680
right like not everyone that contributed

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,280
to open source

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,960
open this came through these programs

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,280
like i came through these programs and

00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,200
i know some people who did but they but

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,480
most of this most of the maintenance and

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,119
contributors are not through these

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,800
programs

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,800
so you don't have so that is not the

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,800
only way so how do you get started

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,240
so so the way to get started is to

00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,880
choose a project right obviously there

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,680
are like

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,040
there are a lot of projects so first you

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,839
have to select a project that you're

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,280
interested in

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,119
this could be a project that you that

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,520
you have used in your company or you

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,800
like

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,359
or it's some or or it has a feature that

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,280
you like

00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,720
or it's it's something that you know

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:06,640
more on or something like that

00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,240
so essentially you get you want to

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,200
choose a project you can choose multiple

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,520
of them too it's not

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,960
yeah there is no rules there are no

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,280
rules here for sure

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,880
so pick the project that you love and

00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,480
have been using anything

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
and then play with the project like

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,680
contribute issues like

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,359
one of the great way to add into any

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,240
project is to is to show the

00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,760
contributors

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,440
to show the maintenance what they're

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,200
missing essentially it

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
this is essentially an issue request if

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,040
you if you know that something is

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,480
missing

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,640
please raise an issue request on any

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,960
project like most of these maintenance

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,920
are pretty fine are pretty open about it

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,760
like if you are

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,839
if you are if you're kind they're kind

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,560
it's like that what how you ask the

00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,839
question

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,640
that's how they respond so uh so

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,800
so it is very important that to raise

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,119
issues if you find anything a lot uh

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,160
that is also contributing to in a manner

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,240
because you're

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,760
asking what is missing and it helps

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,760
maintainers prioritize

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,079
and think of features that are missing

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:06,400
picking the project like uh choose one

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,079
of the projects from the uh so

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,520
picking the project is different when

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,280
you're focusing on the

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:23,839
on the programs essentially if you want

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:23,839
if you want to contribute through this

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,720
can you hear me okay

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,839
i think that we lost tyrone um

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:00,240
yeah we can give some time to yeah i

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,839
guess so

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,560
okay sorry guys that this is totally

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:07,839
unexpected

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,000
ah well anyway i think this is a good

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,200
example of the skills

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,040
uh salvadorians we need for

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,040
inserting ourselves in the

00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:21,680
in the war forks i mean the

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,000
international workforce right so

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,640
uh i think this is a good practice and

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,880
and that's why it's

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,000
for you to participate in this kind of

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,400
events right so

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,920
the idea is that we we will continue

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,640
doing this

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:41,040
in the future uh we also

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:42,720
want to hear with you uh as you know

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,040
there is a

00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,079
there is a webpage and very same page

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,040
that you

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,920
sign up for this event in there we have

00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,040
the

00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,560
the page of the community and you can

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:59,839
uh get into that and at the same time

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,640
in there you will have a the other

00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:03,520
members

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,560
and you can also send us your

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,640
suggestions

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,000
right we will really like to hear from

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,839
you about

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,599
the experience of the event in english

00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:13,440
and and the time as well

00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,040
right we decided to move this to the

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,560
night

00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:20,960
but we would love to hear from you about

00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,320
uh the experience okay through you're

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,000
back

00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:26,560
uh sorry we had a power cut so

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,599
essentially i had to move to mobile data

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,599
is it is it fine enough yeah you are

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,800
totally fine yeah we can ah please

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,839
that's good

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,880
i think you can start over right sorry

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,280
folks

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,240
yeah now this does not happen frequently

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:43,839
and it did today

00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,839
uh we had a power cut essentially

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,359
don't worry so go ahead please

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,800
uh so we we were in the picking

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:55,760
project kind of thing so essentially

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,880
when you when you want to pick a project

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,960
when you're going through these

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,440
mentorship programs essentially have to

00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,400
pick a project that is

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,680
right essentially projects don't there

00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,359
is no rule for the projects to

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,800
participate in these programs it is it

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,079
is all entry if they want to encourage

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,000
and most of the

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,839
popular projects they do that because it

00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,680
helps them too

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,920
it helps them too so if you if you want

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,440
to

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,040
go through these programs you have to

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,359
make sure that you select a project that

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,359
is participating in these programs

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:26,480
so you have to pick a project and yeah

00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,400
you have uh

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,599
through these programs you also have you

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,599
also get uh

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,720
you also have uh each of the project

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,400
also publishes

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,480
what they want you to work on

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,079
essentially so essentially you have to

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,680
you have to not only choose a project

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,560
but also a particular feature that you

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,119
want to work on

00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,920
so they have issues around how these

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,520
projects are

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,720
what issues they want you to work on and

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,280
things like that you can choose from

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,079
them

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,079
and apply for it for a specific for a

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,520
specific feature in a project like

00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,480
it works like that so so

00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,880
so what is the usual process through

00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,280
which

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,280
a a contributor gets selected to a

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,680
program so essentially you have to

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,280
some so what we did is that you have to

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,000
introduce yourself in slack and express

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,839
your interest

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,680
to your mentorship program so that the

00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:14,400
maintenance know that you exist

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,800
and are interested after that you have

00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,640
to

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,480
you you can ask a lot of you can ask

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,000
questions read documentation about the

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,400
project itself and the specific

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,920
feature that the project that the

00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,760
program is about

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,240
then you have to try to write a design

00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,240
token

00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,359
this is the core part of your

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,000
application essentially you have to

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:34,800
write a

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,880
design doc explaining that how we would

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,880
work on the specific feature

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,160
this design dock should not be work in

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,000
isolation you have to talk to the

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,160
maintainer essentially through the slack

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,160
and ask some questions around the design

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,240
decisions that you will take etc

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,920
so you have to make sure that uh you you

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,200
are you are working on

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,319
the thing that is important to the

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,319
maintainer and also in a way that

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,680
that the maintenance would be happy with

00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,440
in in so

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:00,720
so a lot of interaction would be really

00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,560
helpful here

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,480
you have to try to try to design dock

00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,160
with implementation details explaining

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,359
the different approaches and choosing a

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,280
one that is

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,359
that should be the that you think is the

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,040
answer and goes well with the

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,960
with the current way of doing things and

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,240
the maintenance has expressed

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,680
interest about and then each of this

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,280
each of these projects also have

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,319
community calls where you can where you

00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,560
can further discuss

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,800
about the feature that you'll be working

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:30,160
on and how you will be working on etc

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,000
so on one line you have to

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,680
work on the application for the program

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,560
and the other line you have to also

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,160
take up a good first result so so you

00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,319
have written a great design doc

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,920
that works well etc but it's also

00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,000
important that

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,000
uh uh important to gain the trust of the

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,920
maintenance so how do you do that you

00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,200
essentially can do that by contributing

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,640
to the project you can there

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,800
each of these projects also have good

00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,280
first issues that you can contribute to

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,560
so you can do that essentially you you

00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,319
have to do

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,280
it it adds a lot of points for your

00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,560
application essentially like

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,280
contributing to

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,920
uh you know like contributing to other

00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
features

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,400
meanwhile

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,319
can you still see the screen let me

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,160
you can see your your spin like becoming

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,119
one uh

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:27,839
yep let me switch to uh wi-fi the

00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:27,839
current is back

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,599
uh so is it visible now can you hear me

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,680
and can you see the screen

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,920
yep we can hear you uh you're still

00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,359
sharing the same screen right like the

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,640
same slide yeah

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:56,000
yeah that's okay so it works right

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,319
yeah yeah awesome so so as i mentioned

00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,040
uh

00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:01,040
you have to so it is important that you

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,440
gain the trust of the contributors and

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,119
you

00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,640
and you do that by contributing the

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,079
project each of the project also has

00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,880
good first issues and issues that you

00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:08,960
can take up

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,040
so that is that is how you show that

00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,520
you're you're committed to the project

00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,720
by

00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,400
by taking up issues essentially uh i

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,079
i mean i did that and it helped my

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,640
application in very much

00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:22,400
that i mean i think it's more it's more

00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:24,319
the contribution than a design dock

00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,599
in my case but it could be different in

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,599
projects in other projects

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,280
this good first issues you can not only

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,800
contribute through code but also through

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,160
documentation and a lot of things

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,319
it essentially it essentially it

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:41,680
it is essentially part ways showing your

00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,640
skill and also showing that you're

00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,640
committed to the project

00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,920
yeah so so what do you do uh doing it

00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,440
right so

00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:57,359
so once you become a mentorship

00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,960
mnt essentially you got selected so how

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,000
do you do it right essentially

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,200
uh sorry sorry maybe i have to sure but

00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,079
i guess that we are seeing your screen

00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,400
but i don't know

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,079
that is the right one um so i'm still

00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:13,440
seeing your

00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:16,839
um your wireless connection and

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:19,920
you know you want to reshare again and

00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,599
yep is it visible uh

00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,520
is it visible now doing it right after

00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:27,040
becoming one yeah that's it

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,040
now we can see that one okay

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,359
so so so how do you do it right so

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,800
essentially

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:37,839
it is you have to primarily target the

00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,440
the feature that you are that you were

00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,960
that you were selected on right

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:43,440
obviously you have to work on it

00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,800
yeah it is important that you are pretty

00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,400
active in the slack and pretty

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,920
communicative about what the current

00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,520
status of the project is and what you're

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,680
working every day so it's like a job

00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,359
essentially

00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:54,480
because you're getting paid for it and

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:56,319
things like that so it's it's

00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,240
essentially another job and you have to

00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,760
and and how do you work on a job you

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,440
have to make sure that it is the same

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,280
like communicating through maintainers

00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,880
to the maintenance about the project

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,880
what the status every day what are they

00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:08,560
working on and things like that

00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,160
it's important that you write tests

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:14,400
essentially

00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,400
i i i think uh a project is not finished

00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,920
without tests without documentation so

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,760
documentation and tests are pretty

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,040
important that you focus on from early

00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,480
on

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,839
it's important that you follow the style

00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,720
guide of the project right essentially

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,960
because

00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:30,000
most of these projects are pretty

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,079
scalable are pretty are pretty much

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,480
using production so it's important that

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,599
the maintenance expect

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,520
expect a very good bar on the styling

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,040
and efficiency and and operations of

00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,880
your code

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,720
it it it does not mean that you have to

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,400
be a working professional or

00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,240
your skill has to be hundred percent

00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,960
just that you have to be

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:52,400
you have to you have to be pretty pretty

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,920
pretty communicative about it like

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,880
asking the maintenance how to do

00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,240
specific things uh and how would they do

00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,640
a specific feature and things like that

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,640
so

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,680
it's it's not it's not about your skill

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,440
or talent but it's about how

00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,520
communicated you are and how

00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,960
how and how open you are when you're

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,400
when you're getting stuck and asking

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,359
questions etcetera it's more about that

00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,960
than your skill

00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:13,599
yeah so it's important that you also

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:15,920
write docs and blogs on your work

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:17,359
these are they helped me a lot in

00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,960
getting a lot of career opportunities

00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:20,800
etc so it's important

00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,240
doing work is awesome yeah and you have

00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,839
to do it's also important to showcase

00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,040
your work especially that you're you're

00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,480
getting started in open source and

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,839
you're pretty much early in your career

00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,760
like at least through some of this

00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,160
program it's important that you show off

00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,480
your work through documentation through

00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,800
blogs etc

00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,000
uh if it did not happen a lot of cases

00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,440
like as

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,280
there is a lot of competition for these

00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:42,720
projects especially that they're in

00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,720
remote internships essentially you can

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,800
work from your home i did i

00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:48,160
i was really fortunate to work with

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,960
folks in the us

00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,720
from india it was pretty awesome if it

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,760
did not happen uh you don't have to

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,440
worry like

00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,119
like most of these students who get

00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,760
selected they they go through multiple

00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,839
items like

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,280
i did try go i did try google somewhere

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:02,800
of course the previous year and i wasn't

00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,000
selected and i got selected

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,920
so it works like that like any other any

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,359
other thing right you have to you have

00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,480
to try it multiple times to get it right

00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,920
uh uh so so you yeah so if you did not

00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:17,040
get selected you also did a lot of

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,400
project on the project

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,240
all the work on the project around

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
documentation contributing etc

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,079
it's important that you stick to the

00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,079
project like

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:27,839
even even just contributing to open

00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,240
source without any of these programs

00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:31,839
he's also actually okay here people love

00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,440
like i'm sure i'm sure a lot of

00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:36,079
companies would love

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,520
for people who have already contributing

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,119
to a project or who already did their

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,040
contribute to a project so

00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,720
it does it it is not just about the

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,079
program and the way but it's it also

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,079
helps you further in your career like

00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:47,760
just contributing to open source without

00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,280
any specific program and things like

00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,880
that so it is

00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:52,400
very important that you stick to

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:53,440
contributions in open source if you are

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,920
in if you are interested if you are

00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,880
early

00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,280
in your career and things like that you

00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,880
can

00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,040
you can keep applying to the next cycle

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,960
right these these programs happen if

00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,559
or two times every year most of these

00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,520
programs so you have a pretty good

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,079
chance

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,440
and and timeline to get selected the

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,040
next time

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,720
post mentorship so now you guys are

00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,559
going to complete your project

00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,760
one of the important things that a lot

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,920
of students

00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,880
or people through this program misses

00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,319
that they

00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,920
they don't contribute to the project

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,440
after the program

00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,200
i think this is as important as the

00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:26,800
program itself

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,400
like if you have any other commitments

00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,079
etc sure

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,920
you don't have there is no rule that you

00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,480
have to do that but but

00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,240
but you get a lot of benefits doing that

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,200
like after the program too like i know a

00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:39,200
lot of people who stick

00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,559
to a project after the programs i like i

00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,680
did and it

00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:45,119
it gave me a chance to to work on to to

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,880
work on the product feature full time

00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:47,680
now i get paid to do the same open those

00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,359
work

00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:51,680
uh so there are a lot of benefits and i

00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,520
would

00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,880
suggest everyone to to keep contributing

00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,920
the goal the contribution does not have

00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:56,720
to be a code right because you

00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,960
essentially have

00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,000
a full-time job you can you can answer

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,520
questions in the slack

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,119
and things like that there are like 100

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,400
different things that you could that you

00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,119
could do for a project reviewing

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,760
pre-orders

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,599
bug creating attending community calls

00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,280
sharing your ideas creating blog posts

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,480
documentation outreach content

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,319
there are like a lot of things that you

00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,960
can do for a project and i would highly

00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:19,040
suggest

00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:22,079
folks to do to continue with the project

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,800
yep so all the all the slides that have

00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,480
been there

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,079
are specific through the projects and i

00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,000
know a lot of people are not

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,280
students or can go through these

00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,480
programs for them

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:33,680
i would suggest them to not go through

00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:35,599
these programs but

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:37,520
but but in a similar timeline in a

00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,359
similar framework right essentially

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:41,839
pick a project that you are interested

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,839
in

00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,640
and then tell your interest in this lag

00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,640
right go tell them that you're

00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:49,599
interested and express your interest and

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:51,440
then ask them

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:53,839
what is the right thing to work on to

00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,319
get started on like issues documentation

00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:56,800
um

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,480
so it's a pretty act it's a pretty

00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,920
pretty back and forth thing rather than

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,400
a single isolation like

00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,040
you even even like contributions for

00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,720
maintenance

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,160
it's a it's a very collaborative thing

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,280
rather than an isolation thing so it's

00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,680
important that you talk to

00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,960
other people uh and et cetera and most

00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,839
of these people are pretty open

00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,760
and kind so you know there is no most of

00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:17,680
the cases you would get a very

00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,599
nice reply it's just that you don't have

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,160
to waste their time that is what they

00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,119
expect

00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,640
yeah so so you have you can follow the

00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,160
same framework on choosing your project

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,559
getting started with it and then taking

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,240
up

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,319
smaller issues and then the bigger ones

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,240
etcetera so it works like that

00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:33,440
and and most of the cnc projects are

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,359
pretty open about it and

00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:36,720
most of these maintainers have also

00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,839
started in the same way

00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,079
so that is that is the ultimate

00:51:39,839 --> 00:51:43,680
way of doing things uh next i'll take

00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,920
i'll take you and him

00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,599
uh so so far this for this for this

00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,280
question and answers feel free to ask

00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,359
anything about the linkedin project or

00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,880
specific to open source or cncf or

00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:55,440
anything i'm more than happy to answer

00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,530
yeah that's me thank you

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,530
[Music]

00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:07,200
thanks um well we will give it

00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:07,760
some minutes for the pulse to write down

00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:10,720
some

00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,160
questions um for me well one of the

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:15,680
things that i

00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:16,640
usually face um i don't know if that is

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:20,400
kind of a chicken

00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:23,440
neck problem like if you don't know

00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,040
anything about this case uh the cncf

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,920
projects

00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,400
do you want to contribute how can you

00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,000
know

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:32,559
which product to contribute if you don't

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,119
know anything you know that dilemma like

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,079
how do you in your case how do you start

00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,880
like i mean

00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,400
you start like in any project and

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:44,079
eventually apply for

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,839
the program yep

00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,839
so that is a good question actually so

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,440
when i got started with the whole open

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:50,960
door thing like i was in college and i

00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,240
wanted to contribute to open source and

00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,400
most of these technologies are pretty

00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,760
complex enough for a student and

00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,359
and it is understandable right so what

00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,880
what you should do essentially what i

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,079
did essentially was that to try out

00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,160
things essentially like install

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,079
kubernetes try out kubernetes use it

00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,680
install linkedin i tried out linkedin

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,960
and see what essentially it is and

00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,599
understand what

00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,880
what it does uh like like the slack

00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,160
conversations are a great way to

00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,839
understand the project you can you can

00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,559
see what people are asking how people

00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,200
are using it

00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,559
and seeing messages issues prs what

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,240
folks are working on etcetera so

00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,839
just understanding the whole context of

00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,640
the project is important especially that

00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,200
most of this

00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,720
like not everyone you can use can have

00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,640
the experience of using a project and

00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,920
then be like i've used this project i'll

00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,160
contribute to it

00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,359
it doesn't work that way for a lot of

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,359
people so

00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,280
it's not it is not necessary that you

00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:41,040
have to use that in your job or anything

00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,079
you can just try it out and see how it

00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,079
is used and

00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,559
try it out and use and then get that

00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,440
context and then see what you can

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,040
contribute

00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,559
yep you don't have to use it in a

00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,079
previous job yeah that is

00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,920
yeah the other thing that i was thinking

00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,599
is like particular all these products

00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,760
doesn't require too much

00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,000
requirements right uh you can use any

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,400
regular laptop to deploy

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,440
uh very minimal kubernetes i mean using

00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,880
kine or

00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,880
company this was a problem for me to

00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,480
like essentially in college you don't

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:14,640
have beefy laptops and

00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,480
it was pretty like like now that i moved

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,480
into a work laptop etc

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,839
i understand how problematic it was back

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:21,200
then like when you're living with the

00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:24,079
with the normal laptop and you don't

00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:26,319
have a lot to think about i used to get

00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,599
get work done somehow but now i can't go

00:54:26,319 --> 00:54:29,520
back essentially because it is

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,359
that comfortable in a beefy laptop right

00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,800
so there are tools essentially that i

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:34,720
love you to do that kind

00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,839
and things like that as as victor

00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:37,520
mentioned

00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:39,280
and most of these cloud providers also

00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,119
have student credits right i used to use

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,119
a lot of azure student credit

00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,559
you know myself whenever i used to i

00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:46,799
whenever i wanted to have

00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,319
production whenever i wanted to create

00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:49,599
production is the workloads there is

00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,520
github student back

00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,680
there is azure student credit there is

00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,880
aws educate program so make sure to use

00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,880
all these programs and

00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:58,240
and get benefits out of them i'm sure

00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,119
there are like

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,400
like the like the github student pack

00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,079
has like 100 different

00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:05,440
benefits you can get jet brains all

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,559
these ideas for free all the

00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:09,760
professional stuff for free

00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,359
so it's pretty pretty cool that students

00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,119
can access that and you have to make

00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,359
sure that you are you are accessing them

00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,799
i

00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,920
i think that yeah yeah the other thing

00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:20,480
that i haven't tried

00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,960
and let me paste in the chat yeah so

00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,920
that

00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,920
there is this tool where suppose that

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,960
notifies you

00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,079
the new new issues so obviously you can

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,079
monitor like

00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:35,839
all these long long low organ fruits

00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,200
you can but i haven't tried i mean i

00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,160
have to do that

00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,559
knowledge that i haven't tried but yeah

00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,599
i guess

00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:46,480
it's like it's easy to

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,680
start like it's just it's just matter of

00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,280
willing to do it

00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:53,200
yep yep there is there is obviously

00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,480
the concern about it could be language

00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:58,799
it could be it could be your laptop

00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,000
and i had constants too uh and i would

00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:03,200
not say and i would not

00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,960
generalize it that easily but but i i

00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,480
but for a student who wants to get

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,920
started i don't think these are

00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,760
as big as the problems as for

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,839
maintenance for example if i was a

00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,079
maintainer to the project i'm sure the

00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:15,680
the laptop problem could have been the

00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,760
laptop thing could have been a problem

00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,880
but for a getting started person i don't

00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:21,200
think uh

00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,160
i don't think i i think you have hacks

00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,400
where you can

00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,760
where you can try out another tool etc

00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,440
and things like that to

00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:31,200
to pass that essentially without having

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:34,240
to get in work laptop yeah that

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,079
yeah true yeah

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,160
yeah that's right we have a lot of

00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:39,680
misconceptions and

00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:42,640
definitely the community is more than

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,640
welcome to yeah

00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:46,400
like like if there is any problem on the

00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,240
accessibility side of things like

00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,319
language or anything like folks are

00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:51,520
really like if you don't if you did not

00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,520
understand a specific thing

00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:55,119
because of the language or there is a

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,920
lot of complexity in the documentation

00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,160
like i did

00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:59,680
like just asking them in the slack

00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,240
people are more than happy to answer

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,520
like the

00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,599
interviewers would be really happy to

00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,000
help you help you understand a specific

00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,599
thing

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,599
because of the language or because you

00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:10,839
couldn't understand the component

00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,680
they're more than happy to answer your

00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:16,799
question

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:20,559
sure um mauricio raul i don't know if

00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:23,680
you have some more questions um

00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,599
yeah i wanted to share with you that you

00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:29,440
can ask the questions through the

00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:33,280
through the chat you can ask questions

00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:35,839
about anything like for example

00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,480
we we are thinking to continue with

00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:40,000
these

00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,079
these meetings by guests

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,119
and do the the meetings in english we

00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,400
want to know

00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,760
if that is that is a barrier or or if

00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,240
that is a

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,799
that is okay please give us your

00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:54,319
feedback

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,960
certainly we're going to continue to do

00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,880
it in spanish as well

00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:00,480
uh we're also planning to do kubernetes

00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,920
community today so

00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,400
to give you a little a little more

00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,640
background okay

00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,640
this is how how we got started okay

00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:15,200
the executive director of the

00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,640
cloud native computer foundation then

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:22,400
he passed away on november 1st this year

00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:25,839
okay but last year in november

00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:27,359
i had a chance to meet with him and so

00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,040
one of the things that we were talking

00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,440
about it is how

00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,160
where the contributors are coming from

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,400
and so

00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,359
most of the contributors for these

00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:38,480
projects

00:58:35,359 --> 00:58:39,280
are from europe from the us and also

00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,240
asia

00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,280
so the question is how can we increase

00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:45,839
the

00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,040
the the number of contributors from

00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,760
latin america

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:51,359
and so then immediately thought about

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,319
this program it's called kubernetes

00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:55,119
community day

00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:56,079
so what is kubernetes community day it

00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:58,400
is

00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,440
is an opportunity for people to get

00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,839
together

00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,880
to learn so like we're doing here and

00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,799
different topics

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,280
right and so we are planning to do that

00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:10,880
one

00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:13,359
on uh january 30th so far

00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,119
we continue to work on the program i

00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:18,160
know that maurizio

00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:20,880
and victor can pitch in and share more

00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:24,160
about how we are doing these meetings uh

00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:27,760
some of the things that we have come

00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:30,839
making a priority for example we want to

00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,200
share with you how people can set up

00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:33,680
businesses related to kubernetes

00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,640
community

00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,119
uh kubernetes and and open source and

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,319
and

00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,440
cloud name there are over 200 companies

00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,240
startups

00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,640
tyrone worked for one of those companies

00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,599
he

00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:48,480
this company it is not a very big it has

00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,480
maybe

00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,680
25 employees right or less than 50.

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,799
but it is a startup and so it is based

00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,079
on this technology

00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:01,280
and just like boeing buoyant there are

01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:05,839
many others

01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:07,920
okay so by becoming a contributor

01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,599
you start looking at other opportunities

01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:13,440
like buying for example

01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,480
has people marketing we also have people

01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:17,920
that you know

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:20,480
um are um user interface

01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,200
because gotta help people how to use the

01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:23,760
program

01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,280
right how to make it easy so there is

01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,640
room for everybody

01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:30,880
and the community is very big the

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,760
cloudberry computer foundation has at

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:37,040
least 103 000

01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:40,160
uh contributors

01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:42,880
over 500 companies members

01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,920
so the biggest companies in the world

01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,440
you've got

01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:51,359
uh jp chase uh you got comcast

01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:54,880
you got uh facebook uh intel

01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:57,520
you name it okay so by by joining the

01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:59,359
the community you start you start kind

01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:59,920
of coming in contact with with other

01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:01,440
friends

01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,440
you know people that you meet through

01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:06,160
qcon right

01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,599
and so slack makes it easy to

01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:08,160
communicate with people all over the

01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,280

i'm assuming can you answer the

01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:31,680
following question

01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:31,680
how many are are connected now in el

01:02:32,839 --> 01:02:35,839
salvador

01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:04,079
how many of you want to have more

01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:17,839
programs and in english at least

01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:17,839
maybe i hope at least one

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,559
any suggestions on how we can do the

01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,960
program

01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:24,960
different

01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,799
mauricio you wanna champion

01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:38,160
uh well i think we have a lot of shy

01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,359
people tonight but that's not a problem

01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:45,839
okay

01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:45,839
uh an easier question he says

01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,559
no no maybe the other thing that we can

01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:56,319
do is if someone has like a

01:03:54,559 --> 01:03:58,319
particular question that he doesn't know

01:03:56,319 --> 01:04:00,720
how to translate that question

01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:01,359
he can put it in spanish and we can help

01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:13,839
to

01:04:01,359 --> 01:04:13,839
translate that particular question um

01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:17,920
um the other thing i don't know we have

01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,200
to stop recording or we can keep

01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:27,599
going recording i think we can stop

01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:30,160
recording now

01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:32,160
well anyway term uh i think it would be

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,200
wise to hear from you any advice that

01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,680
you might have for

01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:37,440
for for young professionals here you

01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:40,799
know we have a combination of

01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:42,160
uh students for university people who

01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:43,920
are starting

01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:45,680
just to give you some background here

01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,760
what we have uh

01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:52,160
we are basically uh using the

01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,799
technologies universities in here are

01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:58,640
still teaching like the classic

01:04:54,799 --> 01:05:01,440
dotnet javas uh until recently you might

01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:04,799
see some react some knowledge yes

01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,880
so it's uh we have like a technical

01:05:04,799 --> 01:05:08,880
depth in here let's let's call it like

01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:12,079
that okay so

01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,640
i think it depends uh pretty much on

01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:16,240
what

01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:19,359
the attitude of each of us is

01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:21,039
uh regarding what kind of things we

01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:24,079
should go

01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,760
look for and to land by ourselves so

01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,160
i would like to hear your word regarding

01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,640
this how how do you

01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,079
how do you do it uh many people in here

01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,520
have the

01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:38,960
idea that indians are born with a laptop

01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,880
under their arm you know and and

01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,400
and there are a lot of probably

01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,280
misconceptions between

01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,200
and images and you know so i would like

01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,520
to hear from you about that experience

01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:51,200
what

01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:54,640
what brings you to to the career how

01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:57,359
uh how you actually

01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,880
move into that we hear about your very

01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:02,720
beginning but

01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:05,599
you know in a more uh let's say

01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,760
active way what is your what is your

01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:10,880
advice in that regard

01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:12,400
so so i don't uh i think i obviously

01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,920
there are a lot of miscreation

01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:15,599
like misconceptions about india and

01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,400
other countries too uh

01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:19,760
in india like there is obviously the the

01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,520
top like in any

01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,280
any other university programs like it is

01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,440
the top layer the top the top tier

01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,839
colleges and you get a lot of

01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:29,039
opportunity

01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:29,680
but but uh but in india we see a lot of

01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,599
people

01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,960
including going out of their way i mean

01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:34,640
it could be because of uh

01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,039
i mean density population or whatever

01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,400
like uh i i think that is the most

01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:40,559
important thing like

01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,079
like even in my college there wasn't

01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:44,559
kubernetes there wasn't

01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,559
there there weren't even containers is

01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:48,160
that the college or any other university

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,839
program will give you the

01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,079
the the fundamental building blocks on

01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:53,280
what a run time is and what a garbage

01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,000
companies and things like that but you

01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,400
have to build

01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,079
knowledge on top uh to make sure that

01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,359
you're um you're in you're in touch with

01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:01,520
the current state of things right

01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:02,559
the college stuff is on basics and the

01:07:01,520 --> 01:07:03,760
previous state of things

01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,520
but you have to understand what's the

01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,000
current state and that's where you have

01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:08,079
to

01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,280
go on the internet see things read

01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:12,160
things learn things so

01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,599
i think i think it's pretty important if

01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,359
like if you could be in the u.s you

01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:17,680
could be in india or anywhere

01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,880
uh it's the going out of the way

01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:21,440
attitude that helps

01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,119
in any for anyone so going out of your

01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:24,240
way and learning containers and learning

01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,799
kubernetes and see

01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:28,319
what the current it also does not mean

01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:30,319
that you have to do it hundred percent

01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:32,400
like a lot of people like even i wasn't

01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:34,559
like reading it all the way just doing

01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,960
it parts also will help you in

01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:38,559
taking a lot of veneer in your career so

01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:39,359
like just being active on what is

01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,200
happening

01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:43,280
and just reading about it and trying out

01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,960
things maybe maybe doing this very

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,319
simple project on it and adding it to

01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:48,880
your resume i did that too

01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:52,000
so that that that attitude is the one

01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,720
that will help i think yeah

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,960
so it's like stop being shy be active

01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,960
show
