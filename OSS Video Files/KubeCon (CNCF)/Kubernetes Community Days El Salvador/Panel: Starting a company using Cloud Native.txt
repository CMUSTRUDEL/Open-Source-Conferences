	00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,879
we um so what we're going to do is

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,000
we're going to chat a little bit about

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,559
the journey

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,759
of entrepreneurship thank you for for

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,519
for joining

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:18,080
um from southern uh northern california

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,720
and what i'm gonna do is just to share a

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
couple of

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,880
sentences uh about your background

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,920
things that i have learned

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,880
uh highlights and then we would like to

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,359
cover a couple

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,519
a couple questions and the most probably

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,520
everybody is really eager to

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:39,280
to know um seem to be changing the air

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,840
in terms of um the possibilities

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
and so we're looking forward to learning

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,120
from you

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,840
uh all of our goal is a co-founder

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,559
and one of the things that i notice

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,879
about

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,600
oliver is that he's very involved with

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,360
tncf

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
cncf is the cloud-native computer

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,000
foundation

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,800
he looked like it is almost every year

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,920
you do a presentation on service match

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,080
like a deep dive

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,439
right and you share that with uh you

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,360
know with the community

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
yeah and then also the other thing that

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,400
i notice is that you have a heart for

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,760
helping others

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,760
the the young

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,759
people who want to be wanna be part of

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,280
the community as well

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,479
we had one of your employees to present

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,920
the community already

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,280
service mesh and so

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,280
what we learned is that he

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,720
joined the um

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,880
google summer of code and then

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,880
uh through that then went to cncf

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,119
and then ultimately secure a full-time

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,920
job so

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,880
the participants here i think have a lot

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,159
to learn from

00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:00,000
from that as well uh ashar

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,119
uh whiskey he uh identified with him

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,079
because uh

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,159
he's an electrical engineer uh and

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,440
thinking about telecommunication

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
and also uh very familiar with that

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
journey

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,440
coming from pakistan to the united

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,760
states uh

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,200
many many of us in latin america tend to

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,800
think about that journey as well in

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,840
terms of going to

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
um to to coming here to the united

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,040
states

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
and so i think we we have a lot to learn

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,160
you know from that

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,440
in that journey as well please start

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,959
with sharing about

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,720
i know you have companies at different

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,480
stages right

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,480
what it's like you know when we think

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,200
about a startup

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,239
you know for me startup is a temporary

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,800
organization

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,840
in search of a scalable and repeatable

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,319
business model

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,920
i like a small business both are good

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,200
but you know we want to think

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,519
at that and so please just take

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,640
a few minutes to talk about your journey

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,480
as an entrepreneur

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,239
what it means for you especially in the

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,239
context of you know cloud native

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
you start with you actually yeah thank

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,519
you raul thank you for

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,640
the kind words and the uh a nice intro

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,640
that is uh

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,400
you know promising much more than i that

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,959
i hope i can deliver

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
um so let me just share uh very quickly

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
my background my journey

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,599
um my sort of association with the you

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,879
know sort of cloud native foundation and

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,560
sort of the just being part of that

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,560
journey so i um i'm originally from

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,920
pakistan i was born there but i grew up

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,040
in the middle east

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,040
uh in dubai actually and um you know my

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
family just like a lot of immigrant

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,200
families are

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,440
you know going to the places where they

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,519
can find a lot of opportunity

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,560
and uh you know once i finished high

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,040
school uh

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
i have an older brother who you know my

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,920
my

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
my what i really wanted to do was just

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,360
do everything that he was doing so he

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,400
he had graduated in electrical

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,120
engineering so i was like that's what i

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,040
want to do

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,640
even though i really didn't know whether

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
that's what i wanted to do or not

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,480
the one thing that i was pretty certain

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,319
of is that someday i'd love to be an

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,599
entrepreneur and um

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,360
you know because i felt that the

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,200
entrepreneurship was really the ultimate

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,760
expression of kind of freedom especially

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,280
coming from

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,040
you know developing world and just

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,840
having control over your destiny

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,599
um and so i graduated uh with a degree

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,799
in electrical engineering from texas a

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,919
m and uh uh

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,160
you know this was around 2009-2010

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,520
and the economy was just starting to

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
recover and

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,840
for me i was always of this mindset that

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,960
oh electrical engineers are superior to

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,960
software engineers

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,720
um and the software stuff yeah you know

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,639
it's it's all this fuzzy

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,479
code but you know real engineering is

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,080
all about what you can touch and feel

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,400
and i was like i want to go and work for

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,759
intel and you know semiconductor company

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,759
because that's very real

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,360
and uh you know the universe obviously

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,000
had different platforms as much as i

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,840
tried

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,840
uh you know to get into that space you

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,360
know i just wasn't smart enough or

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,080
whatever the reason was like i

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,560
just couldn't get any of that and you

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,880
know my

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,880
the time was ticking for me uh in terms

00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,360
of getting a visa and you know finding a

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,320
job

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
and i had a uh my girlfriend at the time

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,120
who

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,160
well girlfriends like who became my wife

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
eventually was like hey

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,880
let's get married and we had a long

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,960
distance thing going on so i was like

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,479
let me take the first job i can get

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,160
and it happened to be as a systems

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,479
administrator a systems analyst

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
specializing in storage operations

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,000
uh out of a data center for a financial

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,759
services company

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,520
and i did that you know for a couple

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,720
years and this entire time i was like i

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,560
really want to go back into the

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,400
semiconductor space because again real

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
engineering real hardware engineering

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,639
you know uh so it was a very young kind

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,680
of inexperienced mindset

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,800
um and then you know i moved to silicon

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,960
valley because i found an

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,680
opportunity to kind of join this hyper

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,880
growth startup called box.com

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,960
and you know my my and at the time

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,800
devops was really just in its beginning

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,080
phases the word devops was really

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,320
starting to come in and

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
a lot of education was going on around

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
it companies were really debating

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
whether we should adopt this these

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,680
principles these practices

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,800
at the time chef puppet were really kind

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,280
of the big

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,919
you know orchestration and automation

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
sort of

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,120
companies at the time they've kind of

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,479
fizzled out a little bit over the last

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
decade or so

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,400
um so that attracted me to that stack

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,160
attracted me to come and work on the

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,759
infrastructure side for box.com and

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,840
that's where i got to see

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,960
a whole world of you know what does it

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,759
take to build a

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,440
cloud-first cloud-native company and you

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,919
know why do we do that and

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,120
i was there for four years and it was a

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,319
pretty exciting journey

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,479
and i got the you know experience touch

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
and feel every single part of the

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,360
infrastructure

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
and it was a really interesting time

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,360
because blocks itself was transitioning

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,319
from running data centers to moving to

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,479
the cloud

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,319
which is a very exciting but also can be

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,000
a very very painful and stressful

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
journey

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,160
and lots there's a lot in there that

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,680
there's a lot of a lot to unpack and one

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,639
other thing that i'll state in terms of

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,639
a

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,319
mindset that a lot of companies have is

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
that oh you know we

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,440
and what's changed quite drastically is

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,720
that hey we are going to build

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,400
everything in-house because we are the

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,199
best engineers we think we have the best

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,280
engineers

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
so we're actually going to go and build

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,479
you know our own alerting system our own

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,960
observability system

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,840
because you know um that's what i like

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,840
to do and so

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,120
anyways was part of that journey then

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,880
joined another uh

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,280
sort of pre-ipo fast-growing company

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,360
called mulesoft um which was later went

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,680
public and then was acquired by

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,360
and had a very large presence in south

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,160
america so i had a chance to come

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,360
visit um you know go to argentina buenos

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,039
aires and

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
it was a pretty amazing experience for

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,360
me and that's where i was running

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,599
platform engineering

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,680
and that's where the world was really

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,440
shifting so quickly from

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,120
you know i just within a span of five

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:44,240
years i've gone from

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,319
running data centers to how do i run

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,680
and manage my container workload and

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,199
orchestrate across that and there was

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
just a whole new set of problems and

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
challenges and

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,440
what inspired me to start blameless was

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,560
not necessarily the technical challenges

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,560
because the technical

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,479
you know as technology evolves like

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
those will always be there

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,520
but what gets left behind is really the

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,919
people challenges like how

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,199
are how do you make your developers more

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,120
efficient

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
and you know give them you know super

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,520
power so they can manage complexity

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
and that kind of became the seed of of

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,759
blameless because what ended up

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,520
happening was a lot of the

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,960
the operations folks would get left

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,479
behind and say oh you know what i'm just

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,160
going to write code and

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,879
ship it and then there's some guy with

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,919
the title sra or operations engineer

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,599
who's going to take care of these

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,720
problems for me and that wasn't really a

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,280
world that i wanted

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,360
all of any of us to live in um and so

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,399
that became the genesis of blameless

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,479
you know we when uh we got you know

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,719
applied to y combinator got accepted

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,680
ended up not going actually doing y

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,680
combinator

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,080
but because we ended up raising a seed

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,680
round and a series a round later on from

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,760
some tier 1 vcs which is a very

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,279
fortunate journey but the one thing that

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,360
i'll i'll just

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,480
say and then i'll transfer over to

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,200
oliver

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,880
is my biggest learning there was really

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,959
at the time it looks like it was a very

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,839
smart thing to do but i promise you one

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,680
thing is that

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,360
in that moment i had no clue what i was

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,760
doing and why we were able to raise

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
money and why this was exciting

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,279
but the biggest learning for me there

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
was to really look at step back and look

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,320
at the

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,240
you know what are the high level market

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,480
trends that are really going to

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,760
you know drive or determine your success

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,920
because quite frankly

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,600
99 that's what people refer to as luck

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,200
it's really not luck i would say i mean

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,839
there's obviously an aspect of luck to

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,240
it but it's really having some kind of

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,240
a sense of okay here's where we are

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
today here's what the past does look

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,399
like

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,600
and my prediction and what i think the

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,120
future is going to look like so i'll

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,680
give you a very simple example which

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,360
seems

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,720
more obvious now than it did maybe three

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,720
years ago which is

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,839
really around the complexity of running

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,040
and managing and maintaining

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,720
microservices

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
i mean we can we all know because we're

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,839
part of the cncf

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:54,320
community is that um there's just now

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,000
more sort of energy excitement

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,720
ubiquitousness around

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,760
the adoption of you know containerized

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,440
platforms and passes and stuff like that

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,920
even up until three years ago or four

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,680
years ago this wasn't the case so it was

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,360
but a lot of companies that made that

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,800
bet at that time are now

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,120
benefiting um from this really big

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,160
wave that's pulling them uh from a lot

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,519
of you'll hear about this in a lot of

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,560
observability companies and stuff like

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,160
that but anyways

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,640
i know there was a lot that i threw out

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,079
there uh for for folks and uh you know

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,279
i'm always happy to chat some more

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,040
through there's there's so much to

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,600
unpack in that in that short period of

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,600
time

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,200
but hopefully it gives you a sense of my

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
journey and my experiences

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
so far thank you

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,000
i need one second i have some dogs

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
barking

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,000
yeah sometimes it's you know it's

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,839
serendipity right

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,120
i think i wanted to use that word you

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,760
know sometimes we think we go in one

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,680
direction

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,800
and all of a sudden you know we are

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,320
guided

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
directed in a different in a different

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,079
direction yeah oliver

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,000
is going to share something yeah sorry

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,120
about that timing

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,640
yeah so it's actually funny i think my

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,959
background is very different from shows

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,120
but

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,320
uh very parallel in some ways i think

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,360
especially in

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,480
the summary um so i'm from new jersey

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,920
originally i'm

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,240
the first one in my family to go to

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,600
college i went to a small engineering

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,880
school in new jersey called stevens

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
institute

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,440
and i was really lucky there um to get

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,440
kind of early in my academic career of

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,079
some exposure to like linux and unix

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
systems

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,920
and that really sparked an interest

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,800
for me like i i've always been kind of

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,959
interested in like

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,640
how things work and really i got into

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,320
computer science at all because i wanted

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,320
to have a website with

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,839
a counter and to have a counter you had

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,680
to have a web server somewhere held that

00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:42,720
state and so i learned pearl to write a

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
counter and then

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,839
like that really spawned this whole

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,440
career from just trying to build

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,399
websites for myself

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
and uh as i started learning unix and

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,560
linux

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,560
i started working in the computer lab at

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,160
the school

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,399
i worked for the system department at

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,720
the school and then

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,839
later in my career there uh as i was

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,680
graduating

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,519
the person i was working with got a job

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,680
at yahoo out in sunnyvale

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,360
and so about a year later i followed him

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,880
out to sunnyvale and started working at

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,240
yahoo

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,560
and that was uh i mean who's been

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,399
not a company at all anymore but at the

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
time it was like one of the two biggest

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,959
internet

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:28,320
services and uh it was incredibly like

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,880
to just have a front row seat to

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
or really a backstage seat to how the

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,240
internet works

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,040
and how messy it is and chaotic it is

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,120
and

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,800
slow moving and it's just much less

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,360
sophisticated than you think

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
uh as a user of these services a lot of

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,519
the time

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,880
um and that was really the you know at

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,480
that job i met

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,399
the people i was working with and the

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,720
kind of surrounding cubicles

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,600
um i was working with five years later

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,360
at twitter like

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
a lot of the same people kind of moved

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
between companies and it's a really

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
small industry once you're actually here

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
and so that job was

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,600
working in um production operations so

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,000
what

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,040
what was like an ops or system and team

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
um and

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,079
really working on like you know the

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,600
start of cloud services at yahoo like

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,880
how do you provision vms

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,000
yourself without having to go through

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,200
hardware revision requisition processes

00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,920
and then i went to twitter in 2010

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,000
i was probably the second or third

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,240
programmer hired

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,320
on the ops team and so where my full

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,760
focus was going to be programming and

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,600
like i sure said we were building our

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,160
own observability systems

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,079
and twitter was building mesos which was

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,440
kind of a predecessor to kubernetes but

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,600
a lot of these core

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,040
infrastructure technologies were

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,800
developed at

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,120
all of these companies and a lot of this

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,680
comes from google and facebook too where

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,600
like

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,279
google facebook did it this way and then

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,880
all those engineers want to go do this

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,600
at other companies um and we

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,120
that was really uh fortunate timing to

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,880
be there because i got to see

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,320
twitter go from a single rails

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,760
application to a big distributed

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
microservice

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,600
and you know really see how the

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,600
organization shifted and

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
so like when i started i was on an ops

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,399
team that had a single pager for the

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,440
whole company

00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,040
two years later i was on call for my own

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,920
services that i would work on during the

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
day and get paid

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,040
on at night and so going through that

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,360
transition

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,399
um and really being able to internalize

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,880
the

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,959
things that are difficult about it and

00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,800
um are unpleasant about it

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,040
and and what what makes things work well

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,320
not is really what informed

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,639
um when we wanted to go start a company

00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,519
and

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,079
i never wanted to be an entrepreneur my

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,240
dad

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,600
was kind of an entrepreneur my whole

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,720
life and it seemed like

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,079
a very stressful busy life um so

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,000
i was like i want to work at a big

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,560
comfortable company where i can go play

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,560
ping pong all day and it's fine

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,560
and my co-founder william was like no

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
like we've been in the middle of this

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,839
and like docker's happening kubernetes

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,800
is happening all of these things are

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,839
gonna happen and we

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,480
we should go apply our skills not in the

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,560
like

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,079
back room of one of these consumer

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,199
companies but we should go

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,240
provide value directly at what we're

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,760
good at

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,000
and so that was really the start of

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:23,040
buoyant um and that happened

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,959
early late 2014 early 2015 that's when

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,560
we actually started the company

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,480
and we really took the same techno open

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,120
source technical things i was working on

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
at twitter

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,519
um and that and used those things to

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,279
build the first version of linkedin

00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,120
really to kind of bootstrap this idea of

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,399
a service measure

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,079
and it's again to solve these

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
organizational problems of like well if

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,880
you're at a company and you're trying to

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,360
do microservices you're going to have to

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,120
solve

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,800
all of these communications problems and

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,000
the communications piece is really what

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,040
becomes

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
the interesting part of a very high

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
leverage

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,120
piece of the system and no one was

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,800
working on it at the time right everyone

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,720
in the mesos land was just focusing on

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
getting containers up and running and no

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,160
one was talking about how to make them

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,600
communicate well

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,519
and so that was you know five or six

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,240
years ago now

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,000
the anniversary is just coming up and uh

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,560
yeah it's been a long

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440
wild ride but um you know part of the

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,320
keys to that were one have being in the

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
having been around it enough to really

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,120
see

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,279
how these things work and you know being

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,560
at companies that were on the forefront

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:32,480
of a lot of these uh technical decisions

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,320
and realizing like these were inevitable

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,839
like this is the whole industry is gonna

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,360
go this way

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,279
whether they like it or not and it's

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,199
just a matter of time so we should start

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,959
doing what we do well for the rest of

00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,279
the world and since then

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,160
cncf has been created and now we have a

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,720
home for

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,240
lots of you know very cutting edge

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,199
infrastructure technologies that are no

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,519
longer

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,800
stuck behind the like employment walls

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,240
of all these companies

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,000
they're now developed in the open

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,680
there's training that's you know broadly

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
available on the internet and

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,959
they're accessible to i think you know a

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,480
whole next generation of engineers that

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,000
are not going to have to be sitting in

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,000
sunnyvale to

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,079
to meet people and to learn these tools

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,240
and and get started with the stuff

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,120
so it's a really exciting time i think

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,720
and especially with

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,240
you know remote work all of these things

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,360
are kind of converging to

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,559
create a much more decentralized

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,799
you know internet ecosystem

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,280
and the thing is that these can happen

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,360
everywhere in the world i mean

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,039
like the basic i mean i'm thinking that

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,000
the basic all basic needs

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,679
you know we need we need schools we need

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,919
we need food

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,200
so i mean the the active companies right

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,000
now the supermarkets

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,640
you know the food delivery systems and

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,480
so

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,080
those are large distributor systems as

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,679
well right i mean everything starts

00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,840
small but it can grow from there

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
so there's a huge opportunity everywhere

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,559
because

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,120
you know when we compare the needs of

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,240
anybody in north america or in south

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,640
america

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,640
very similar right transportation

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,799
yeah we we recently just found out that

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
um lingerie our open source project is

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,480
being used to

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,480
by some of the companies doing vaccine

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,280
distribution and

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,320
atb is one of our users who's done talks

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,919
at cloudnativecon

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,600
um about how they were ex rapidly

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,679
accelerated their microservice adoption

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:26,000
in the middle of the pandemic to do

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,039
in-store deliveries and things like that

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,600
um

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,039
so yeah it's being in this open source

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,559
space connects you to

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,320
all of these other opportunities and

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,960
industries in a way that um

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,520
really wasn't possible five to ten years

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,559
ago

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:42,720
yeah just the ecosystem wasn't there i

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,799
i remember from one of our conversations

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,320
uh oliver it is that

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,840
you you mentioned something that caught

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,360
my attention said

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,360
i had to know myself

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
uh i i yeah i think i mean as as part of

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,400
the

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,280
uh journey of starting a company

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,960
there i'm sure sean was kind of saying

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,320
this too like you start you don't really

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,160
know why

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,720
people are interested in it or if it's a

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,240
good idea and you kind of have to like

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,720
trust yourself and be willing to fail

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,320
quickly and like accept that it's going

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,000
to be hard and

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,440
um yeah i think that it's been the

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,640
journey of starting a company is one

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,400
that is a lot about

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,200
uh learning who you are as a person and

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,480
and what you're good at and also um

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,160
being able to identify that in other

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
people especially your co-founders being

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,880
able to really

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,919
trust them and give them honest feedback

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,440
and patience like it's uh

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,480
the people things are the hard part much

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:52,799
more than the technical challenges

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,520
yeah um there's a there is a question

00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,679
here

00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:01,440
from don clark i think uh he says

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,840
i and few industry colleagues uh telco

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,559
entrepreneurs are trying to address the

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,799
severe

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,440
challenges for startups to engage with

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,440
telcos

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,360
telecom i put a link to a group in the

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,840
demand chat

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,480
do you guys share the view that telecom

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,760
is a

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,880
graveyard for startups

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,720
on what we can do about it and then we

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,000
we have put our

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,400
a proposal for a code of practice for

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,320
chuckles to engage startups we

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,840
appreciate your feedback on your

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,840
on your page

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,760
yeah i definitely have some opinions on

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,640
this but uh oliver if you want to go

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,000
first please

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,360
feel free my take is that

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,679
any large organization is is

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,120
a great card for startups you know i

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,200
think as a startup your

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,039
your lifeblood is people who can make

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,919
quick decisions without lots of decision

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,080
makers

00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,120
and a telco is the kind of opposite of

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,400
that um

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,240
but same for utilities or large most

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,679
large banks

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,320
but i'd be here with ashara's opinion

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,760
yeah i um i'm of the same opinion as

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,240
oliver i

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,919
well so um i kind of look at the world

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,400
if for folks if you haven't read this

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,480
book it's called crossing the chasm

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,760
and uh it talks about technology

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,679
adoption patterns

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,919
and um you know how you have the

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,360
innovators the early adopters the early

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,320
majority

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,039
um and usually you know the largest sort

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,400
of companies

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,200
out there fall into the late majority

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,640
and you know

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,320
sort of the laggards if you want to call

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,679
them that like very late and sort of

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,520
coming up to speed and it

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,039
it's a risk versus reward thing they're

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,600
very they've been built

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,440
to the point where uh it's more about

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,960
governance and risk and control than it

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,960
is about innovation of course this a lot

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,159
of this is changing by the way

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:59,760
and generally if you take a very like

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:01,760
sort of uh you know very like a

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,960
an open-ended approach to engaging with

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,520
telcos then i

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,000
100 agree that you know you will

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,000
probably

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,440
it does become a graveyard very quickly

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,200
because just to navigate

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,799
decision making understanding that

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,120
decision making in itself

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,360
can take you know many many months if

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,280
not potentially years and that

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,720
is just very precious time that you have

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,000
as a start-up and you're burning through

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,679
your capital and then you

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,280
there's only one thing that can kill an

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,880
early stage company and that's running

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,760
out of money right

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,640
but um what i i'll caveat this by saying

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,400
that

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
given that there's a lot of market

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,080
because of kovit there's so much market

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,559
pressure for a lot of these large

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:41,120
companies to now perform like startups

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,640
right and you'll see a lot of shakeup

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,200
and change happening in a lot of these

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,400
companies and it really comes down to

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,799
can i find that one small team

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,919
of let's say five to ten engineers that

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,679
is kind of

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,520
really moving away from the rest of the

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,520
pack and just like moving very quickly

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
and adopting cloud technologies adopting

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,200
new practices new cultural patterns and

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
stuff like that

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,080
and you're not going to get that just by

00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,520
googling and sort of just doing some

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,280
random linkedin searches you have to

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,200
have the connections in those companies

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,159
to identify very specifically what is

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,960
that one team

00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,440
that's a small sliver of hope uh that i

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,039
would

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,640
that i have for a lot of these large

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,000
companies and something that we've seen

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,600
where they've engaged with very very

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,760
early stage companies is

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,240
it's it's the ones that are just like a

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,919
small five to ten percent team that

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,280
is kind of empowered to make its own

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,000
decisions and move quickly

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,360
right um i'll just say one more thing

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,840
which is generally

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,120
my um the other thing that i'll say is

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,120
you know

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,799
i i would i would i would recommend or

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,200
encourage everyone to think about like

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,000
whether

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,279
the tel like working with telcos i i

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,679
understand that the

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,640
you know in a lot of developing you know

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,480
countries

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,960
um the telcos are the ones where a lot

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,799
of technology seems to be concentrated

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,200
but imagine for a second that you know

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:58,960
that this feels like a solved problem

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,080
right what is the horizon 2 and horizon

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,080
3 going to look like

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,200
when everybody has a cell phone that's

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,159
performing at 4g

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,799
5g levels and you know your the needs

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,720
that

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,400
your basic needs need to be fulfilled

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,240
and i would recommend folks to kind of

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,520
look beyond that

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,080
and assume for a second that the

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,080
infrastructure to you know for your

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,159
cloud and app ecosystem has kind of been

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,120
put in place the network infrastructure

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,720
is in place

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,960
what does the future look like and

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,520
that's where i think the opportunities

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
become

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,960
um really really exciting it's a pattern

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,559
i've seen in a lot of developing

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
countries i myself am from pakistan so

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,760
i've worked with early stage

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,120
companies in pakistan and i see this

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,200
pattern where they're like hey

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,039
the telcos have money and we want to go

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,720
to them and we want to get them excited

00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
about what we want to solve problems for

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,360
them

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,640
and all that kind of stuff and again it

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,120
what ends up happening is

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,960
um you know it really comes down to like

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,360
who do you know at those places that can

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,520
help you

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,559
it becomes a kind of an unfair game at

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,559
some point right

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,320
so but again i think the opportunities

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,320
are beyond like if you just take telco

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,320
out of the picture and think beyond

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,080
you know i think that's where a lot of

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,640
exciting and interesting opportunities

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,679
come up

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,640
um you know for folks to think about so

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,279
really my opinion yeah yeah on that like

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,640
i

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,960
i what i'm most excited about is

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,480
i think our users are going to be the

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,679
people who are our customers and our

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,440
open source users are going to be the

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,799
one that disrupt the telephones

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,240
like we're not going after the market

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,640
incumbents we're going after everyone

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
who's

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,480
trying to eat their market right and i

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,000
think

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,840
you know we can be a part of that

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,120
transformation that's great for our

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,120
company and it's also great for the

00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,480
industry because that's kind of the

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,679
how things should work right

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:44,720
thank you for for sharing that insight

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,720
you know from my perspective you know

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,320
we've seen this happen in the last four

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
or five years right i think four or five

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,760
years ago

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,720
we still had you know a lot of startups

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,039
were trying to

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,919
reach out to telcos but it's um

00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:59,440
you know what there is other

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,720
opportunities in the enterprise and

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,159
that's you know it's

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,400
it's difficult to to justify um

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,919
now thinking about that the other

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,320
question that i wanted to address

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,760
so a lot of folks in here would be maybe

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,600
interested in this question as well

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,240
is uh knowing what you not know

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,840
and you you're very much involved in

00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,200
different parts of the world

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,279
you know uh in the past

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,799
you know the the idea was that things

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,600
happened in silicon valley right and

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,080
both of your companies are you know were

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,000
born

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,520
in in silicon valley so

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
but now since everything changed

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,440
especially now after kobe

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,720
you know what what are the possibilities

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,520
for these companies to be born

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,320
in in latin america central america and

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,039
el salvador

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,039
you know for example

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,720
yeah that's a that's a really great

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,200
question raul um

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,919
and i think you're spot on uh in terms

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,279
of like

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,720
because of covid so this is a two-part

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,080
answer right because it's a little bit

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
more nuanced um

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
the reality is that look at the end of

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,880
the day a lot of the

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,279
talent the when i say money i don't mean

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,919
like just any capital i mean just like

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,240
a smart capital that has you know

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,600
decades worth of experience investing in

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,159
building technology

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,279
company happens to be concentrated very

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,279
much

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,399
in silicon valley so that is a reality

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,960
that i think people

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,799
it is now starting to slowly diffuse out

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,200
into other areas and it'll be

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,960
probably three to five maybe maybe a

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,840
longer time frame before

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,200
we start to see more of these hubs and

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,320
when i say hub it's not just like

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,320
where's the talent

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,159
but the talent the money the connections

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,080
the customers all coming together you

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,600
know that those kinds of hubs

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,279
you know austin just in the united

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,080
states austin is a place

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,640
you've got um you know new york

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,520
obviously

00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,840
la now utah a lot of these these places

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,919
are

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,080
are starting to pick up and outside of

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,000
the the outside of the us

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,679
i mean i mean there's also a lot of

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,880
examples just in north america mexico

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,480
i've been hearing a lot of great things

00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,640
about mexico and a lot of

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,559
sort of these technology sort of hubs

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
and investment hubs starting to pop up

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,480
canada is another place and so it is

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,080
going to take time

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,440
and you know it's really you have to

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,480
figure out how you want to time yourself

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,360
in such a way that you can take

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,440
advantage of

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,919
but there is a certain acceleration that

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,080
you do get by having a presence

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,120
in silicon valley if you know maybe it's

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,720
just your sort of

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,480
non-r d kind of function that's there

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,720
at the same time what i'll say is uh

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,159
what i found over the last you know five

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,320
to seven years is that the because of

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,919
you know communities like cncf and open

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,760
the open just general open source

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,399
community which is incredible just the

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,039
shift

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,039
that's happened in terms of knowledge

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,799
and mind share kind of diffusion that

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,600
has gone out to the rest of the world is

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,919
actually pretty amazing right where i'd

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,520
say seven to ten years ago it used to be

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,200
oh we're gonna you know companies had

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,000
this decision to make hey we're gonna

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,840
there was this conception which now is

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,840
is definitely a misconception that oh

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,600
silicon valley engineering talent is

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,279
much higher quality than

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,039
or north american engineering talent is

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,799
much higher quality i think that has

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,240
been a very very drastic shift and a

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,440
drastic change

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,559
and um you know i think a lot of the the

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,640
talent that's coming

00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,000
in central america south america and

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,520
other parts of the world

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,760
because look at the end of the day those

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,399
economies and what's driving those like

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,799
those are just

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,080
booming economies that are accelerating

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,320
at faster paces

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,640
in you know than they ever have before

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,399
and that creates a lot of opportunity

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,799
and challenges for the businesses that

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,720
are out there especially b2b enterprise

00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,559
type opportunities include and of course

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,039
consumer and that's kind of like this

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,840
rising tides uh lift all boats and i

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,120
think

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,520
um you know for those folks you know the

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,919
the

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,240
the key thing for me is that the talent

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,720
the the technical engineering talent

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,080
is has really come up to par where it's

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,159
becoming

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,679
you know it it's it's kind of reached

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,200
this tipping point where you can say you

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,240
know what i can get

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,080
a similar you know a similar uh you know

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,279
quality in terms of engineering talent

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,600
which i couldn't get before

00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:10,799
outside where i don't have to be paying

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,440
people top dollar

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,880
because they happen to have the uh what

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,399
i like to call the pedigree

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,000
more than anything right it's like oh

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,760
they've worked at these these big name

00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,840
companies but it really comes down to

00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:23,360
can they deliver and execute and solve

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,640
the same kind of problems that i am

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,480
and i think that's the biggest shift

00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,120
that's happened and i think that's a

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,720
that's

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,240
i think my advice to a lot of

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,679
entrepreneurs that are in

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,440
you know central america or south

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,120
america you know is to

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,520
be mindful of that and take advantage of

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,600
that and really like have faith and

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,919
and have faith in yourselves that hey

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,080
like we are performing or

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,840
are we like we are have achieved the

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,120
same levels as kind of you know

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,039
for looking from the outside you're like

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,120
oh wow there's this like you kind of get

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:53,039
star struck by silicon valley but

00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,399
what i'm challenging that to say like

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,480
that's no longer true

00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:58,559
anymore and you know you should really

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,320
believe that uh and you'll see a lot

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,240
you know and i it'll create a domino

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,640
effect of money that flows out into a

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,360
lot of these countries

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,840
yeah i think one of the unique things

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,919
about

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,039
silicon valley at least in my experience

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,200
has been

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,320
that investors will talk to us and say

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,159
you're going to give your

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,440
your software away for free and still

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,760
give us money like

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,279
most investors in the world don't think

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,640
about software that way

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,159
where they're kind of thinking about the

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,480
network effects around open source and

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,120
so

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,679
i think there's a lot of like smart

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,399
money

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,080
in in the valley area that can spot

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,840
these patterns and trends in a way

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,519
that they're more willing to put you

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,519
know seed checks down

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,200
sizeable seed checks down for kind of

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,000
open source or

00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,640
infrastructure technology but on the

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,480
other hand

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,080
you know if you build a successful open

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,240
source project or

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,159
a really usable software as a service

00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,880
website you'll be able to get silicon

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,840
valley money

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,320
if it's used and useful on targets right

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,000
so

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,919
i think i see we're seeing investors

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
become smarter about this stuff i think

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,440
cncf especially

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,960
like and now my father-in-law asked me

00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,399
about kubernetes because he's heard

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,720
about it and it's like

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,600
i think the tides are shifting there but

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,640
um

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:16,000
the access to capital is very unique

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,640
in the bay area i think yeah

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,240
the word is out and so therefore this is

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,120
a great connection i mean in terms of

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
cncf

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,159
what about the community in terms of you

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,840
know i sure

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:28,399
how have you connected with you know

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,559
cncf and

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,919
and what would you tell tell the you

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,919
know the

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,720
the folks here how to go about it

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,519
so i have a long history with cncf um

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,360
well

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,039
relatively long i would say about five

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,840
five to six years

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,120
um in like the earliest i think it was

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,480
cncf

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,039
year two or something like that where

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,880
they um i forgot the name of the summit

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:56,240
that we had this was in seattle

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,960
um so and i've been um you know cncf

00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,080
is i think is a pretty incredible

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:04,480
community when it comes to

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,600
launching thinking about you know giving

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:08,640
away for free

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,480
validating your product idea uh startup

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,399
that you're trying to build especially

00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,919
in the you know that's taking advantage

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,320
of this big wave

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,919
of trans transformation that's happening

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,880
around infrastructure and managing

00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:22,399
infrastructure

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,720
cloud native infrastructure right um and

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,720
um my recommendation for any company

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,200
that is in that space is that you have

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,120
to be

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,480
involved you must be involved in cfcf

00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,279
because it's like that's where all of

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,880
the

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,399
activity is happening that's where a lot

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,559
of the you know

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:38,480
uh it's it's kind of become this brain

00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,919
trust in the world which is it's pretty

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,279
amazing like what this community has

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,200
been able to do and what's actually

00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:45,440
quite frankly come out of this community

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,960
and um and how it's brought people

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
together and the kind of shifts that

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,960
it's making in the world so

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,640
uh 100 that if you're thinking about

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,399
something in this space or even quite

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,840
frankly adjacent to this space right

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,880
like it doesn't even have to be oh

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,880
something to do with

00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,159
you know when we think cncf we mostly

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,640
think microservices

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,399
containers kubernetes you know but think

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,840
about the the network effect

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,679
of the things that are happening once

00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,879
you do have a sort of cloud native

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
platform it's like okay

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,240
what does the developer ecosystem look

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,919
like you know how does it change the way

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,359
we do product development what are the

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:16,879
product managers going to need what are

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,800
these kind of tools that really plug

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,399
into what's coming out of cncf

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
and so on and so forth how can we make

00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:24,560
people better you know

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,480
sellers of software you know and stuff

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,320
like that so it's just uh you know

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,720
there's a lot of adjacencies that i

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399
think um it sort of creates and

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,320
and you know i think people should think

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,079
about yeah also

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,839
we were both you know blessed by having

00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,119
good networks from working at companies

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,639
where we're meeting people

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,879
and cncf is that network now that kind

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:45,119
of

00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:45,919
spans beyond you know unemployment

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:48,320
boundary

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,119
um and so i've now become great friends

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,480
with folks

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:52,800
at you know all of the major cloud

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,760
providers and other startups and

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,960
that's all through going to the

00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,640
conferences and

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
going to these events and kind of seeing

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,480
people year after year

00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,400
and so those relationships those

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,960
individual relationships can really be

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,000
a really important part of starting your

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,440
business and

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,200
getting the right feedback or the right

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,680
co-founders

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,800
you know it can make a huge difference

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,680
on whether you're successful or get off

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,560
the ground or not

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,560
yeah that's fine

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:22,000
victor has a question but i think you

00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,640
you kind of have a

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,359
address that he says cloud computing has

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:28,400
had a great

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,720
impact on every industry in

00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,200
uh in general what what are the benefits

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,720
of and advantages that startups can take

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,280
from the cloud technologies to

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,280
accelerate

00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,280
well it's a lot cheaper to get started i

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,880
mean you can

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,560
most startups can get free credits on

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,079
the cloud providers

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:48,240
you get a whole bunch of tools that you

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,800
can just take off buying

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,760
software like we're customers of

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,000
countless

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,960
other startups who just provide kind of

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
tiny little

00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,440
functions that we would have to hire for

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,880
or you know

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,400
so i i think the that ecosystem

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,079
just pays dividends and lets you lean on

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,839
common things that are being solved by

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,200
everyone instead of by

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:15,200
individual companies yeah i i

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,480
i can't i really i think oliver put it

00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,640
really well i can't even

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,599
really add much to it i mean i can't

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,960
even think of

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,480
it would be i would really be surprised

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,440
if there are companies that are like hey

00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,359
we're going to go

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,880
and start by renting out data center

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,640
space and that's how we're going to go

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,320
to market with our product

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,920
um you know that would just be like very

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,440
surprising to hear in today's day and

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,200
age and

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,720
quite frankly like um

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,800
what's happening is that you know the

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,920
average time for a new company to launch

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,520
with a product in a

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,440
sort of an up-and-coming space has

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,079
shrunk has really shrunk

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,880
down from you know it used to take five

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,520
years

00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,200
three to five years to now 12 months on

00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,480
average where you can

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,640
you know a couple of folks over the

00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,320
weekend go and get some cloud credits

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,040
incorporate a company

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,520
um you know put a sort of poc out there

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,320
use all sorts of sas and pass and ias

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,839
technology

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,040
bring it all together and boom now you

00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,680
have a product that you can put in front

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,000
of users

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,599
you could do that in realistically

00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,280
somewhere between four to six weeks like

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,200
if you wanted to like really do it right

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,800
that's what a lot of companies like a

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,280
lot of these accelerators kind of make

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,640
you

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,960
you know when you when you're part of

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,640
that that's the ex that's kind of the

00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,079
the motion that they really drive you to

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,599
is that within three months you're

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,880
you've you're sort of doubling your user

00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,560
growth and stuff like that and all of

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:37,839
that comes from just leveraging

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,839
cloud technology sort of native so

00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,040
this this question is from raymond

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,200
escobar

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,359
is there a way to connect with those

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,839
startups before they become

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,839
1 billion u.s

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,880
i think it's as a research right in

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,720
terms of crunch phase

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,480
i think it's a it's a i think what

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,240
you're asking is like what are the

00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,520
leading indicators that

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,640
kind of demonstrate or show um

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,240
startups that are you know more likely

00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,000
to succeed because obviously success is

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,880
not guaranteed but more likely to

00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,520
succeed

00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,839
um and get to a reason you know a good

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,160
outcome

00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,079
um um and i would say

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,200
you know there's there's a few few ways

00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,520
to look at it you know

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,440
look at you know the the most important

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,440
thing is the founding team

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,720
is like what is what does the team look

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,200
like and

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,640
like if i'm if i'm an investor if i'm uh

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,119
like looking for a co-found whatever i

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,359
look at

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,520
who is the founding team that's one

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,200
again understanding the problems

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,200
base is pretty important but that's

00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,119
that's pretty uh abstract at this point

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,760
but you you know you look at

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,720
where are the the tier one investors

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,640
putting their money

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,160
consistently and what industries and

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,160
stuff like that and then

00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,760
you go to linkedin and look at you know

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,400
how many people they've hired how many

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,680
job posts

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,240
there's like a bunch of different sort

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,000
of things that you can look at um

00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,480
that can kind of give you a sense of

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,760
like hey where is a company headed and

00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,520
of course there's just like the brand

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,240
awareness right like you hear

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,440
constantly you know a name like you know

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,720
buoyant and linker d

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,200
you know you guys have done a pretty

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,880
incredible job because you know a lot of

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,480
you know i would be surprised if folks

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,839
don't know about like you're just tied

00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,000
to service mesh

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,359
um and service mesh technology and you

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,960
know linker d being open source and

00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:26,400
stuff like that it's just this constant

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,000
drum beat that you hear about so

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,520
it's never one thing it's always like a

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,520
multitude of things

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,800
yeah yeah and i i'm a little bit of a

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,440
broken record today but

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,800
i the network is so important right i

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,720
the way i meet new

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,839
startup founders who are trying to like

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,240
get their products off the ground is

00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,760
through

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
their co-workers who they worked with

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,280
before who i know or

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,640
their previous founders at the last

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,640
startup they were at like the

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,079
network of folks who are trying to build

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,640
things is so important

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,200
and really i mean one of the great

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,119
things

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,240
about silicon valley for all problems is

00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,839
that it's a really encouraging

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,920
environment it's not

00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,680
generally a cut for sharp elbows kind of

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,119
space it's really

00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,720
companies trying to help each other be

00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:07,200
successful and figure out where there's

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,960
common

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,240
places that we're where we can leverage

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,359
and build together

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,880
um and so you know cncf being one

00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,480
community the open source community

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,400
is one way to build those connections

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,319
and then the other is like

00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,839
talking to founders at companies and

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,880
like asking them what they're

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,280
doing like there's that sharing of

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,400
um it's really kind of like a demo day

00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,760
um

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,280
culture where everyone wants to show

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,400
what they're building and get feedback

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,760
and like see what someone else is

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,400
building and think about it with them

00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,119
and

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,599
uh that is really i think the the best

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,560
part of silicon valley and

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,200
i'm glad that we see those good things

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,480
kind of

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,640
extend into open source communities

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,839
you know more formal way than they were

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,200
previously

00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:54,640
yeah i think that's uh that's if i'm

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,560
hearing correctly one

00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,240
one way there are many ways but one way

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:00,800
would be to connect your community

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:02,319
and therefore here's an opportunity to

00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,319
connect to cncf

00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:06,319
that it has a hundred and hundred and

00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,319
three thousand 000

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,920
contributors and it has over 800 company

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,560
members the largest companies in the

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,040
world

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,960
and over 200 startups and so start

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:19,280
looking at those startups as well

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,200
go to the cncf website and start

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,960
studying those companies

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,520
another way is you know connected you

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,119
know to linkedin um

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,160
we have started a um

00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,240
a group for uh kubernetes community of

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,720
savage

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,240
join join there one of the questions

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,800
says what what are the best ways to

00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,960
convince

00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,359
investors to support startups in central

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,359
america

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,680
it's a good question um i don't i don't

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,480
know if i have an easy answer but i

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,839
think

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,440
the um ultimate answer is to

00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:00,720
uh you know build something valuable and

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,720
like being uh confident

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:04,480
building good demos is a great way to

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,000
get interest um

00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,839
and you know i think ashara said this

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,319
before but most investors invest in

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,640
teams

00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,839
more than specific product ideas because

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,480
the product's gonna change

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,599
a hundred times before it gets open to

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,079
the public

00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:18,800
um but they're gonna select on the

00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,680
people

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,079
that they think can execute well um so

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,240
you know

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,760
when we raised our seed round like

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,920
investors had done all this

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,000
reference checking that like they found

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,760
people who sat next to me two jobs ago

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,760
and like asked if i was you know a

00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,839
diligent worker so

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,359
it can be you know again it's a lot

00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:39,200
about relationships and

00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,560
kind of having the right references and

00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,400
um

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,480
yeah you know good good product sense

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,839
kind of always wins why not what

00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:50,720
one one small note here is that

00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:53,119
um in the past right uh this is just

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,560
from personal experience in the past

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,920
um investors okay

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,480
uh went to uh central america

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:03,119
to find investors as well you know

00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,880
because people

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,800
in central america there are a lot of a

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,200
lot of business owners

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,160
they have um these businesses for a very

00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:12,960
long time

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,920
right you know families you know for for

00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,680
long periods of time

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,119
and so they need to invest their money

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,560
so they invest in their money

00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,920
through you know uh private equity or

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,480
or obesity's you know in silicon valley

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,280
so these people are very mobile they're

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,599
everywhere

00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,000
right so but the thing is that if they

00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:35,920
come up with an idea in central america

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:40,880
that makes sense they will invest on it

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,960
yeah so that yeah

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,319
they're they're both really good points

00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,920
all over and around one thing one thing

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,200
that i'll say is

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,400
um the most important so

00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,319
there's a couple of things one is

00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,240
investors are not going to

00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:55,760
invest in something that's big today i

00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,960
mean there will be they'll do it they're

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,920
going to invest in something that is

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,480
going to be big

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,400
right and so what is that is the story

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:03,520
that you as an entrepreneur have to

00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,359
you know that's your job as an

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,560
entrepreneur to tell that story over and

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,400
over again

00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,760
uh but more importantly i think the the

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,160
core of that is

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,880
you know don't follow ideas but follow

00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,079
problems

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,359
that's the most important thing that's

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,319
the biggest distinction that i would

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,640
recommend

00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,000
making is that you know ideas and

00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,000
solutions and you know

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,119
you're gonna have so many of them but

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,319
the thing that

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,720
really needs to be the central focus of

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,920
you know of why somebody's going to put

00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,480
money into something is

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,839
is your ability to communicate why as a

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,079
particular problem

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,839
is the way it is today and how it's

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,119
going to be in the future and how it's

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,880
evolving and getting you know

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,480
potentially worse and how

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,839
your platform or your system is the

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,440
thing that comes in and solves it

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,480
regardless of what sort of domain that

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,119
you're in right

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,880
and so that's the story that the story

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,280
arc that you as an entrepreneur

00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,119
uh need to tell and whether that's

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,000
central america or any other sort of

00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:57,359
part of the world

00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,359
i think that's if you follow that

00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:01,119
pattern um you know

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,040
invest you know there will be a lot of

00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,119
money that's out there that you can get

00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,880
very you know not it's not very

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,359
difficult to get that money

00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,720
yeah there there are companies you know

00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,920
for example

00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:17,680
one in central america is called uh uber

00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,560
is it is you know spell hill but uh

00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,920
it's you know it's it's half traction

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,280
you know in central america

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,079
you got rappy who has uh raised

00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,560
one billion dollars in an investment as

00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,560
well

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:32,240
right and it's making you know

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,240
significant progress so

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,280
all these companies start happening you

00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,640
know in latin america

00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,119
in central america so now for for those

00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,480
for those folks that perhaps are in

00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,200
school right now

00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,280
uh in college we you know the the um

00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,480
the community started with a good number

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,560
of them you know by

00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:57,920
joining the the group um and so

00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,119
in part it is i would say the challenge

00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,760
is to believe that i

00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,319
how can i find if i am in business right

00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,200
or

00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:06,000
i mean i'm studying computer science but

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,359
how can i

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,720
you know i'm not programming right

00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:13,040
what other things can i do for the

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,839
community and so i think

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,640
that um putting out together an event

00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:19,680
like this

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,720
will be one right or documenting

00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:25,440
you know a program

00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:26,240
or translating right or sometimes you

00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,319
know connecting

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,280
just reaching out asking questions i

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,800
think you know

00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,560
what what is your what is your take in

00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,839
all this based on your

00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:40,400
you know um involvement with uh

00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:43,760
with this young person

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,839
so on our side um yeah i think

00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,520
the people think to get involved in an

00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,800
open source project that you have to be

00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,520
a kind of

00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,880
senior developer contributor and that's

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,480
really not the case

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,319
you know where where we need the most

00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,760
help is a lot of times just helping

00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:59,040
people right so we have a slack room and

00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,240
github issues

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,119
and you know a lot of what would i do

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,760
with my day

00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,280
if i let it happen is like i'll just be

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,160
asking questions and trying to help

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,040
people

00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:11,839
debug their problems with them um and

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,119
that is

00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:16,480
both the way i learn a lot about how

00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,760
different people systems work and

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,839
different person kubernetes that i

00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,280
haven't seen before but also

00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:24,480
um it it is a real contribution to the

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,640
project because like

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,240
they're you know it's uh again that

00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,040
helping like we

00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,359
our job is to help people be successful

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,200
and

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:34,800
when people help us help other people be

00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,680
successful that's even better

00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,400
um and so that is yeah documentation is

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,200
a big

00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,960
help there um you know just being

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,960
involved in debugging and

00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,640
reproducing issues can be a really good

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,040
way to learn and

00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,079
you know ask questions at the same time

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:53,280
um

00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,319
also blog posts and tech meetup talks

00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,800
have been great i know uh sergio who's

00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,319
in the audience today um has done a

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,760
bunch of both of those where

00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:05,280
he's done uh talks at kubecons about

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,240
things he's learned and just sharing

00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:11,040
that knowledge uh one

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,400
raises your visibility and more people

00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,680
know who you are and and

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,040
um you know know what your skills are

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,599
and it's also a great way to

00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,880
learn things it's kind of you know

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,760
conference driven development or

00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:25,359
conference driven learning is uh

00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,040
maybe not the ideal way to do it but it

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:29,520
is certainly a forcing function that

00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,520
gets you there

00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,040
any comments not sure no i think uh

00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:39,839
you know oliver stated it pretty pretty

00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,480
well you know

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:43,040
i i think he's he's definitely the

00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,359
expert

00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:45,359
on this

00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,160
what do we have to do uh to get you to

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:55,200
come back at the kubernetes community

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:56,160
el salvador when you know if we manage

00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:59,760
to

00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:03,920
to have a physical presence right

00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:07,119
do you have vaccine i'll go for vaccines

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,079
yeah yeah so that's that's that's the

00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,680
next question

00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,119
well when we first started you know

00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,880
thinking about this we

00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,559
we we saw the possibility of drilling

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:18,240
face to face but then

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:21,280
quickly you know turning to into virtual

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,760
but um yeah we look forward to to the

00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:25,440
next

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:29,040
you know the next step

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:33,440
in in all this and uh

00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:35,440
um get you to come back

00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,119
yeah i would also suggest just in case

00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:39,520
there are especially students out there

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,319
um google summer of code and the linux

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,319
foundation

00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,680
uh lxf community for what used to be

00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,640
called community bridge are great ways

00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,800
to

00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,760
get involved and be signed up with a

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,480
mentor

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,760
get paid so i was lucky to do summer

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:55,520
code when i was a student

00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,359
and it was really difficult but a

00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,040
learning exercise yeah and we've done

00:49:57,359 --> 00:49:59,440
that a few times and it's a great way to

00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,160
kind of

00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,440
get hooked into a community um but it's

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:05,839
always kind of starts

00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,359
by finding projects that have

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,200
interesting things that you're excited

00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,079
about and spending lots of time on

00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,839
like way too much time is the only way

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,160
you learn anything in the space of

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:18,319
my my experience how do programs

00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,760
different the linux foundation and

00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,599
summer of code

00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,880
i think it's basically who pays so

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:26,079
summer code google

00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:29,280
pays and uh they it's not just

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:31,520
uh it's not just cncf it's like any open

00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,319
source project apache foundation

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:36,000
many many many apply there um so if you

00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,960
want to do react development you can

00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,480
usually do

00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,960
uh i'm sure there's some react summer

00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:43,200
code projects and things like that

00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:45,760
lxf as far as i understand is much more

00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:49,119
focused on the linux foundation and cncf

00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,119
so they're they're parallel um project

00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:53,280
interim projects there how big are those

00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,960
programs

00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,920
google's number of codes massive it's

00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,440
been 10 or 15 years they've been at it

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,280
and i don't know how much money they

00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:05,599
spend every summer but it's quite a bit

00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:08,000
um and lsf is probably a bit smaller

00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,640
i think you know in the linguity

00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,119
project's

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,640
quite small as far as number of uh

00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,960
maintainers so

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,680
we'll do between one and three interns

00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,079
in a

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,720
summer but a project like kubernetes

00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,200
might do

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:22,000
you know ten so it depends on the size

00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:25,200
of the project and

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,800
and um yeah you know what what

00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,400
what what's going on that summer for the

00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,720
company

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,599
you know one thing uh raul that i i

00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,680
wanted to share

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,520
um it's something that we've done in

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,640
pakistan before which is really partner

00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,480
with a

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:41,200
forward-thinking you know sort of

00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,800
government that

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,480
you know is able to set aside some

00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:47,440
budget for driving

00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:48,400
um innovation within the government

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:50,640
itself so

00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,480
you know they'll sponsor these

00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:55,440
fellowship programs hire

00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,960
a bunch of students pay them a stipend

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,640
and then they'll give them a bunch of

00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,319
sort of it's a great opportunity to

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:03,440
bring open source projects

00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:05,280
into the government um and i think uh

00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,480
that's i've seen that program work

00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,720
really really well

00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,480
and then it it becomes exciting because

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,040
then you can expand beyond that very

00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:13,599
quickly

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,040
into sort of more adjacent uh domains

00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,599
beyond that but

00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,359
um if there's a way or there's a program

00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,040
or some kind of like an accelerator

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:23,839
incubator fellowship type

00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,200
thing um you know it can be maybe at the

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:27,760
local government level

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,000
um there's a there's one called there's

00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:31,920
this code 4

00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,359
movement that was started here called

00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,520
you know it was quote for america

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,200
code africa and stuff like that so a lot

00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:39,760
of i would i would highly recommend

00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,280
folks to look into that as a way to

00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,040
um i think there might be one for

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,160
guatemala as well there's definitely one

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,839
from mexico

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,520
uh that's a really great way to kind of

00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:49,280
engage and you know take on some of

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:51,920
these projects and again bring in

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,200
a lot of open source um you know a lot

00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,200
of open source into these

00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,559
these environments which is very cool

00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,599
when you hear about the end results

00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,359
which is like oh

00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:01,200
this government transformed the way in

00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:02,880
which you know people get their driver's

00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:04,800
license and it's all powered by

00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,640
you know kubernetes linker d and it's

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,160
just like wow like we're really changing

00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:11,440
people's lives

00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:15,680
so yeah and the other thing that

00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:18,559
folks here did want to know is that

00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:19,200
both of you have hired and have people

00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,319
working

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,280
in latin america right so the the

00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:26,559
secrets out

00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,440
right you know you go where talent is so

00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,680
if talon is ready in latin america it's

00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,359
you know everybody wants it

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,440
so it's a huge opportunity uh after this

00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,079
panel we're gonna have our next panel is

00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,800
going to be

00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:46,000
one where folks that are contributors

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:50,240
and there are from latin america

00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:53,280

00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:59,760
connecting

00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,800
with the open source community so i hope

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,480
you can

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:07,839

let me see

00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:43,599
victor says i think open source is very

00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:48,880
aggressive idea for telecalls

00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:50,880
given they came from standards mindset

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,760
so there's this this is a community that

00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:57,760
debates this issue in terms of

00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:01,040
you know open source and um

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:04,319
and standards but thank you for for

00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,319
