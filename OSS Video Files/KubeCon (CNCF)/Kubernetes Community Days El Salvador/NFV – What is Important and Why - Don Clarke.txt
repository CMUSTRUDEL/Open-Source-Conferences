	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
colleagues across the telco industry and

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,640
we published a white paper

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,839
which was now quite famous the so-called

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,719
nfv white paper

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,320
published in october 2012 and this

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,519
announced the future direction for

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,240
telecom networks

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,960
and that paper introduced the term

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,680
network functions virtualization or nfv

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,560
uh which we which we actually ourselves

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,279
cooked up

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
um and then we founded a body called

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,119
etsy

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,560
european technology uh

00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:34,320
telecommunications standards institute

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,160
um to host um all of the documentation

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
and specification work that we wanted to

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,480
do

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,000
that was back in 2013 in 2014 uh we

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,440
wanted to get the open source

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,079
communities involved in what we were

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,399
doing

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:49,200
so we founded a new plan uh open source

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,760
community called open platform for nfv

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,039
uh opnfv probably some of you are pretty

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,600
aware of it

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,800
is now merging with another organization

00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,640
called cntt

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:03,520
and is now called anuket so opnfv

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
is is now transitioning to a new a new

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,119
form

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,119
back in 2014 you guys know uh kubernetes

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,880
initial release from google

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
and that's why i guess i'm here because

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,320
kubernetes then became a new way

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
to implement software um within um

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,479
the cloud environments and we wanted to

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,880
use that too the first commercial nfv

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,360
deployments took place in 2015 just four

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
years

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,799
after we brought out our white paper

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,560
and since then we've had obviously

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,439
commercial deployments of nfv around the

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,520
world

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,000
but at cnnv it's been doing all of the

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,000
specification work for the industry

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,520
and we've had now three releases of

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,439
specifications

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,439
and the fourth release is now in

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,399
progress so that's really the basic

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,799
the basic concept main thing is we want

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,880
to use

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,960
industry standard hardware and run all

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,200
kinds of exciting network

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,000
workloads on those but there are some

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
points to remember

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,960
about telecommunications right telecom

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,719
network infrastructures are not the same

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,840
as uh as enterprise it environments

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,560
it's heavily regulated um it's massive

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,879
geographic and volumetric scale

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
and there can be no downtime for

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,400
software updates right so when someone's

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,160
dialing 9-1-1 uh on their phone you

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,640
can't suddenly have that call cut off

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,280
because

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,560
a it guy somewhere is doing some

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
maintenance

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,080
so that's one of the really key things

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,040
to remember about telecommunications

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,120
network

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,080
the other thing about telecoms is that

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,800
the services

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,560
persist for many many years and that

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,879
means that the technology itself on

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
which the service runs is changing

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,360
but the service itself mustn't change a

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,239
good example of course is

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,640
is is telephony making a call today is

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,000
the same as it was 50 years ago

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,680
and you think well you know the

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,440
technology and that time has evolved but

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,440
the service hasn't evolved very much

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,239
network operators are unique um

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,800
operations are unique to each operator

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
and jurisdiction so the requirements for

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,560
telecoms operators in europe a little

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
bit different from the us so there isn't

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,239
a one size fits all

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,519
uh for the telecommunications

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,360
environment right

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,440
so one operator has a particular set of

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,480
requirements and time scales

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,519
maybe bt in the uk 18c has a different

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,120
set of requirements at

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,640
different time scales so this is

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,560
something to bear in mind

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,120
uh in the open source community and i'll

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,200
come back to that in a while

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,400
each operator must be in full control of

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,640
its destiny

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
so we can't have a community that

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,000
decides what the time scales are and

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
tells the telecom operator what that

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,879
time scales are for a release

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
saver of openstack or something else um

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
the operator says no

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,560
i want that release on this day and if i

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,720
don't get it on that day then i'll

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,159
miss some of my regulatory or commercial

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
imperatives so

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,920
operate telecom operators must be in

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
control of their own destiny

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,439
and that really comes down to um the key

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,519
thing in telecoms and that's standards

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,720
when people hear the word standards they

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,560
think oh

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,400
that's a long time to take it takes a

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,959
long time to do standards

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,599
it's very slow and it's not very

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,159
innovative

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,840
that's probably true in some respects

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,920
but it's absolutely crucial

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,200
to facilitate innovation because we want

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,959
interoperability

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,040
between all of the people that

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,720
contribute um technology to our networks

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,320
so one of the things that i have got

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,560
here i'm not going to go into the detail

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,800
on this slide you can read it

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,479
how comparing standards with open source

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,520
what's the difference what's the pros

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,000
and cons

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,600
standards basically is about

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,720
specifications open source of course is

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,960
about code

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,919
um so where does standards not an open

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,280
source meet

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,120
well first thing to say is that

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,080
standards define interoperable

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,639
frameworks

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,479
um these are the frameworks that produce

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,680
the network architectures that we want

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,479
to deploy

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,400
and that one we want that to support

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,680
software diversity so the standard is

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,600
issued as a

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,880
and then we want the industry to deliver

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
to us um

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,240
the the software um solutions that

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,960
support the uh

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,639
support those standards open source of

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
course i know you guys that know about

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
open source during kubernetes

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,320
uh it's absolutely critical to

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,639
accelerate innovation

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,840
and especially in applications right um

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,800
so to me

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,720
open source are absolutely and standards

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,960
are absolutely complementary

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
it's not an either or they're both very

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
important um

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,520
in our industry and one of the things

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,919
i'd like to draw your attention to which

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,160
i

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,759
rail knows i'm passionate about is

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,880
diversity

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,479
so in in all things we want diversity we

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
want all kinds of viewpoints we've got

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,320
all kinds of cultures

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,199
to bring their ideas and so one of the

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,840
things that i

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,240
um i've always tried to do in my career

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,160
is

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,759
is form collaborations with different

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,039
people from different places with

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
different backgrounds

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,639
so i'm basically an international guy

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
i'm british but i'm living in the united

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,199
states

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
and i have many many industry colleagues

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,199
around the world that have become

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,000
friends

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,720
over time critical capabilities for

00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,520
telecommunications

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,720
so this list is something which we all

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,840
hang our

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,199
future credibility on right designing

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:16,080
systems that are secure by design

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,199
retrofitting security is not a good idea

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,039
you need to

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
to actually design security right in

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,639
from the very beginning

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
we want to basically make sure that we

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,360
can assure the networks of working

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,280
properly

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,520
and that they're resilient they meet the

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,560
targets for availability and

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:34,319
and up time we want automated fault

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,600
management these are vast scale

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,440
infrastructures

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,199
so we want to make sure that if anything

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,160
goes wrong we are able to

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,440
detect that quickly and remedy it

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,000
automatically preferably

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,199
without any manual intervention this all

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
sounds really

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,360
motherhood and apple pie but these are

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,280
critical things they're not easy to do

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,880
they're not easy to implement and then

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,560
for telecommunications we want

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
deterministic performance

00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,599
we don't want to click on something and

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,919
wait five seconds

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,520
absolutely what throughput that we

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,440
promised our customers we want the

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,400
latency the delay from going

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
one into another end of the network and

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,199
the timing to be

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,120
communicated all the way through to the

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,720
end point and there's this thing called

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,680
jitter which i won't go into but it's

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,039
basically the

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,639
the timing variations that happen in in

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,319
small intervals of time

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,800
and then this is something that for the

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,639
open source community is very important

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,639
how do we make sure that features

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,120
persist from release to release

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,880
if we fork the software for example into

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,280
a proprietary form

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,080
has that fork got the the feature that

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
we need

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
that we actually implemented and

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,440
required in our network

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
uh and indeed have deployed and there's

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,000
some horror stories where open source

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
communities

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
dropped a feature the update was applied

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,599
to the network and then the network

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
stopped working

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,960
all sounds pretty obvious but these

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,720
things happen and then we want

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,000
seamless software updates i've said this

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,319
once already

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,280
no down time and something else to bear

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
in mind is

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
in in in the commercial world most

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,039
software's license

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,560
of course there are open source licenses

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,080
and they are all

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,560
they're all present in many of the

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,160
software um systems that we deploy

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,400
we must make sure that we understand

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,360
what licenses are applicable and that we

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
actually pay for those

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,919
resilience i'd like to make a few a few

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,639
remarks here about resilience

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,960
um first of all software running on

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,280
low-cost standard hardware

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,960
can be made highly resilient right so i

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,959
think that probably pretty obvious for

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,640
you guys you can deploy your kubernetes

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:39,120
cluster on one system and

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
and have a backup in another system and

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,560
if one system goes

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,599
down you can switch over to the backup

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,640
so

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,800
and once you're in the software

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
environment there's lots of novel things

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,040
you can do

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,240
to enhance resilience um software

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,640
systems can be

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,200
designed to be largely immune from

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,440
multiple simultaneous hardware failures

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,480
and that's because we can do these novel

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,720
redundancy

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,399
um schemes uh a colleague of mine at nct

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,200
docomo for example

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,920
um tetsuya nakamura who's now without

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,040
amazon

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,160
web services tetsuya worked on a system

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,720
in japan um after the fukushima disaster

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,720
where

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,399
most of the of the mobile network in

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,320
japan was taken down

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,959
um due to overload and he designed a

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,920
resilient system based on nfv

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,000
which actually migrated the core network

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,240
uh within 30 minutes to

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,279
to another data center 100 miles away so

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:38,640
we can have a very very large geographic

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:41,200
redundancy using software

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,640
some of the key issues for the for the

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,680
for the telecoms industry

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,839
um security um we all know about

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,600
vulnerabilities

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,200
we all know about the elimination of

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,959
huawei from uh

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,640
from many countries systems because

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,399
they're chinese

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,720
that's pretty controversial i actually

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,160
own the relationship with huawei when i

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
was at bt

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,079
and they're a good company but

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,880
nonetheless that's the perception

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,560
and so the supply chain has been damaged

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,880
to some extent by perceptions of

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,720
security vulnerability

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,120
there is a shortage of people in the

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
telecoms industry with hybrid skills we

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,760
need telecoms people that can write

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,519
software

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,680
we need software people to understand

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,160
telecoms and there's a big hint

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,200
about commun future career opportunities

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,480
for those of you

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,839
that are thinking about your career

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,360
telecommunications could be a good place

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,640
if you've got some really good software

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,120
skills but you'll need to get some

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,279
telecom knowledge

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,279
lack of diversity of running code if

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,720
everybody's using the same code and it's

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,800
hacked and there's a

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,200
and there's an attack everybody goes

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,839
down this is where software diversity is

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,600
really important

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
and that's one of the advantages of

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
proprietary software somebody's code is

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,640
different from someone else's code if

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
everybody uses the same

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,000
open source release everybody's code's

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,720
the same

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,240
the complexity of integration um that's

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,560
something which i'm not going to go into

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,760
here

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,279
maybe that's a a a topic for another

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
talk but basically bringing all these

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,880
systems together different vendors onto

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,680
a common platform

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,760
um is complex and uh and there's a

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,360
question in the industry who does that

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,880
and indeed that's probably one of the

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,320
big barriers at the moment to

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,480
software and migration of

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,079
telecommunications networks

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,560
i'm particularly interested in the lack

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,079
of diversity in the ecosystem

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
the problem with the ecosystem is that

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,600
not too many people want to come into

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,600
telecoms because the

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,720
the time scales for deployment are so

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,880
long that there's not a an roi

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,760
for uh for for many small vendors that

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,000
that meets their investors requirements

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,360
all of that sounds all very nice and

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,240
there's a bunch of work that we've done

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,079
in etsy nfv

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,760
that looks into resilience so for all of

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,880
you that are interested in reliability

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,399
and resilience

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,160
um there's some really good work there

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,680
fault management just a few say a few

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,800
things about this and i'm conscious of

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
time

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,000
fault management's really really

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,600
important for network operators probably

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
number one after security

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,920
um we need to be able to deploy virtual

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,760
network functions from different vendors

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,800
onto a common platform and thought

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,200
assure them

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,760
so gulf good fault management requires

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,680
ability to detect filter and correlate

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,360
and what we don't want to do is overload

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,320
the infrastructure with fault management

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
telemetry

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,079
so yes we can instrument everything we

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,000
can monitor everything but

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,680
what happens to all of that data when it

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,560
gets abstracted up

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,920
to two operations so there's some very

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,680
interesting work that's been going on

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,959
there to try and figure out

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,680
how we can use nfv to uh to assure

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
networks

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,680
and have some novel techniques for

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,000
analysis

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,680
a little bit more about resilience we we

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
know from the hardware world that we

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
have this thing called the bathtub curve

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
um at the beginning of the product's

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,720
lifetime there are hardware bugs they

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
get ironed out

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,959
and over time um the hardware starts to

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,680
deteriorate might be the battery in your

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,680
phone

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
and we see this kind of end of life wear

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
out

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,959
it may be surprising to know that

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,160
software actually has some kinds of

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,160
these features

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,160
uh when we're doing test and debug we've

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,000
got a lot of problems with bugs and

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,440
the software may crash and that means

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,920
it's not very reliable

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,360
as we go time we should through time we

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,279
shoot updates

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,000
we we fix bugs but in fixing

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,519
the bugs we introduce another bug so you

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,680
have this kind of

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,120
curve where you you do software release

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,600
the software crashes because you

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,519
introduce

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,279
new bug you fix that then you do another

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,120
release and then you get another book

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,120
so you send see this rather interesting

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,839
curve and so this is one of the things

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,800
which we

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
we're concerned about in

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,360
telecommunications we want

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,959
predictability

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
so how do we make sure that when we do

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,800
software updates we don't get an

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,639
unreliable network

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,320
and there are some ways to to to

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,120
mitigate that and one of the things this

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,040
thing called

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,199
end version programming which is to say

00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,160
that we have a number of software

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,480
functions that are normally identical

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,440
but

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,360
only one uh if one of those is faulty

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,560
for example or has been hacked

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,800
then we want to make sure that the

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,000
others are the ones that control the

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,079
in let's say for example it's

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,519
controlling the aircraft um you don't

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,920
want your aircraft to go down

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,560
because um there's a bug in the aviation

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,839
system

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,240
so a number of different things that can

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,920
be introduced there

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,360
uh this is my last but one slide um

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,399
the ecosystems are very very complex and

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
the first thing that happens in

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,320
telecommunications is that if we want to

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,279
do something completely new like

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,800
for example 5g then we get together with

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,440
a bunch of other people in the industry

00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
and we have a

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,680
discussion what do we want to do and can

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,760
we converge

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,360
all of our requirements so we have a

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,959
number of industry forums in

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,000
in telecommunications this is a very

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,279
small number of them they're actually a

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
lot more than this

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,240
and these guys get together and they

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,360
figure out what it is they want in the

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,839
future

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
then they form or go to an existing

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,639
standards body and they do some

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,560
specification work

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,519
um in the case of 5g a lot of

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,160
specification work is done in 3gpp

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,399
um in the broadband world a lot of it

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,160
was done in the broadband forum

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,760
in the ethernet world you know all those

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,040
ieee specs that you

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,279
know and love they've done in the metro

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,040
ethernet forum and the ieee

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,720
so those are really important but then

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,240
when it comes to actually implementation

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,920
how can we accelerate that

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,920
and this is where open source comes in

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,639
really handy because open source

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,800
communities

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
get interested in how they can make very

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,360
quick progress

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,880
on code and so we have the potential for

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,839
innovation in the open source

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,680
communities i've got kubernetes up there

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,440
but also open source can be used to

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,120
validate some of the specs

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,360
so some of the work going on for example

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,759
in opnv was about validation of the

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,519
of the etsy and fe specs when it comes

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,360
to the products then we've got of course

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,959
the vendors need to get involved in this

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,880
because they're selling products to the

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,800
end users

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,399
let's not forget that the customers that

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,839
are buying this stuff are the network

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,040
operators the telecommunications

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,959
operators

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,279
and uh and then one of the things which

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,800
doesn't sometimes get neglected is where

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,720
do we get the people from

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,639
we get them from academia we get them

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,880
from the communities

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,800
and so research and and new skills are

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,800
being produced in academia

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,880
that's all great um and i'm just gonna

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,800
make a few closing remarks so that we

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,720
can hand off to some q a

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:26,480
um if you guys have got questions um

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,800
the pandemic we're all suffering aren't

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,199
we all at home and uh

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,279
um you know the first uh the keynote was

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,560
fascinating to me to to figure out how

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,000
you how you

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,839
build communities and maintain

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,160
communities while we're all locked

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,839
down in our homes in in and in our

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,199
respective countries

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,959
the exciting thing about software is you

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,279
can write code anywhere

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,600
you can be anywhere and write code and

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,880
you can be anywhere and contribute code

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
to the communities anybody who can write

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,839
code

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,000
but not everybody can write useful code

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,120
right so what what does the code do

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,880
is it any good um documents and this is

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
something which is an old bugbear for me

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,720
right

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
i've written a lot of software in my

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,559
time and i've had to

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,400
try and figure out how somebody else's

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,319
software worked and when i opened up the

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,559
source code there was no comments

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,400
nothing no documentation i'd literally

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,600
go through line by line

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,319
and try and figure out what this

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,799
software's doing and so documenting your

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,199
code

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,039
it's very boring but think about those

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
who are assigned to update your code in

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,880
the future

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,720
and and that's something which i i know

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,120
is is terribly boring

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
uh but critical and then when it comes

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,720
to

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,679
getting a job or getting a new job how

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,240
can you stand out from the rest

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,240
this is a big question and can you

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,080
develop a coding skill that is in short

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,480
supply this is not about learning

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,480
python this is about what do you do with

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
the code

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,520
and so some of the examples where i

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,440
think we've got

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,520
shortages and opportunities for those of

00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,039
you that are looking towards your future

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,880
career

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,360
telecom needs software developers to

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,919
understand networks

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,520
so telecomma needs software developers

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,200
who understand networks

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,320
so what i mean by understanding networks

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
that's doing some basic

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,000
telecommunications courses

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,200
this is about figuring out how routers

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,200
work um

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,960
how do switches work how do

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,400
telecommunications packet processors

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,000
work

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
software developers who understand

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
security architectures are

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,840
in very high demand if you've got some

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,440
security background and you understand

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,120
security architectures

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,480
and you can you can teach yourself a lot

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,080
of this stuff but

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,640
hopefully get some certifications as

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,080
well then there's going to be a a lot of

00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,080
demand for your skills

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,919
and then um this is particularly true in

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,520
the research environment

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,240
software developers with physics and

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,919
maths in my career i've seen a lot of

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,280
physics and mathematicians actually

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,160
switch to to becoming software

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,000
developers

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
because in the end to implement your

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,120
algorithm you needed

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,559
you needed to write some code um and

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,400
who better to write the code than the

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,320
guy that wrote the algorithm

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,760
so that's something which uh to bear in

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,320
mind um

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
and then big rail and eyes as raoul said

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,679
very beginning we've been

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,200
we've been friends very long time and

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,799
i'm interested to explore

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,360
particularly after the pandemic when

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,200
it's becoming clear to the world that

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
people can make useful contributions

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,000
anywhere in the world

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,640
um and they're every bit as good as some

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,240
as in other places so how can we explore

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,360
how to make the talent

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,679
in in el salvador in central america um

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,400
available to uh to the rest of us in the

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,799
world and

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,679
and uh and i'm interested to explore

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,480
that um

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,799
i'm the um on the organizing committee

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,280
of the ieee nfv and sdn

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,240
conference and this is the sixth year

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,559
and last year we were fully virtual

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,120
because of the pandemic in november we

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,440
were going to go to madrid

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,640
but because we were virtual we were able

00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,600
to um

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,400
invite papers from all over the world

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,880
without

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,200
the requirement for the person

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,720
submitting the paper to have to travel

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,400
to the conference travel is expensive

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,039
attending the conference expensive

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,799
so for the first time we had a phd

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,880
student in panama

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,880
who contributed to our conference and

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,559
that person would almost certainly not

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,480
have been able to submit the paper

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,760
because they couldn't afford

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,080
to go to madrid um to present it

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,480
so that's uh that's it from me um

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:34,240
there's a few useful links um

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,240
on the final slide and uh

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,400
that's good and thank you for listening

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,600
over to rome

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,600
thank you john we have some questions

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,159
and i'm gonna combine uh a couple

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,919
questions

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,440
have to do with nfv uh um with nfp and

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,640
also

00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:02,000
uh let me see cnf uh

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,440
cloud native functions and so

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,159
the question is why why cnfs

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,679
and on the same question is more about

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,159
like

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
uh i'm curious to the impact of

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,880
concernization

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,480
in terms of nfv performance

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,320
access to underlying hardware and

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,320
complex networks architectures

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,440
yeah um

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,200
how can i say this um

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:38,159
in cloud net um cloud native functions

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,760
cns are no different from virtual

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,159
network functions

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,400
uh virtual network functions or vns is

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,760
the industry standard term in telecoms

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,679
that hasn't changed

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,520
you can't go into a telecoms environment

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,360
and start talking about cnfs

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,919
and say that they're different from vns

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,840
vns and cnfs are the same

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,000
but as we've gone through time the

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,760
original nfv white paper in 2012

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,080
there weren't there was no cloud that

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,640
cloud native

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,400
thing if you're a cloud person you lived

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,320
in a cloud native environment

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,840
but now that now that you're a telecom

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,200
person you're living in

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,799
a network environment we only understood

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,559
things like virtual machines we

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,400
understood about virtual machines

00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,760
and so in our estimation you created a

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,720
virtual network function within a

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,799
virtual machine

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,240
and everything would be great but then

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,440
over time we realized that's very

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
inefficient

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,559
because now we can use cloud native

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,000
techniques particularly things like

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,960
microservices

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,720
and so how do we now implement um

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,960
network functions in a cloud environment

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
was always the intention

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,120
so the cloud guys took out took our

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,520
concept and said well we don't want vns

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,159
we want cns well that's completely wrong

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,000
c and f's are vnf's v and f's are cnfs

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,760
they're interchangeable

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,760
but coming back to i think the second

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,720
part of the question

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:59,520
on on the useful link screen there is a

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,600
a a document that's been published by

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:05,120
edc nfv which talks about

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,760
how vnf management can operate

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,080
in a cloud native environment so this

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,159
doesn't change the underlying concept of

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,280
virtual network functions at all it's

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,120
simply that

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,919
how do you efficiently implement these

00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,240
things in a cloud native environment

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,240
while the framework the architectural

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,000
framework of the system doesn't change

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,840
it's simply that you're implementing it

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,200
using cloud native techniques

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,440
so that's a useful place to start um and

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,360
if any of you've got any questions after

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,280
you after you read that

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,039
or or you look into this topic a bit

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,640
more get in touch with me

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,840
and i can put you in touch with some of

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:44,880
the experts that are working on

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:45,440
uh virtual network functions um in cloud

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,600
native

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,120
environments using kubernetes kubernetes

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,840
is the standard way to do these things

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,840
now

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,000
please consider joining the uh

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:01,200
kubernetes uh committee dave salvador

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,840
um linkedin group as well we already

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,960
have some

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:06,000
some participants there and so that

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,080
would be a good way

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,840
for that for them to reach out to you

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,840
too

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,520
by all means yeah sure two more

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,640
questions one of them

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,880
is um i would like to

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,880
also hear your thoughts on open brain

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:31,360
okay um i like

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:34,799
i like open ram because it's open

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:38,159
um but open ran um particularly

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,960
um is is being supported very strongly

00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,400
by

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
four global carriers particularly

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,520
european ones um who

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,080
are stating clearly that open ran is the

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,679
direction

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,440
for their future radio access networks

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:56,559
deutsche telekom telefonica orange um

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,240
are the are of other three uh there's

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,400
four and vodafone

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,240
so those guys just announced um two

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,080
weeks ago that you know open round is

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,320
the is the future direction

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,360
um so there's no question that open ram

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,840
is an important

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:15,520
um dynamic but there are challenges

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,360
to make open ram um to be exactly the

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,200
vision that the open round community

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,320
wants it to be

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,559
um i don't um so i

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,559
i like open ram but i think there are a

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,919
lot of challenges for open round to

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,400
deliver the full openness vision

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,000
um because uh first of all there the

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,400
specifications for openran

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:40,240
are are not particularly um well defined

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,760
and so that means that interoperability

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,640
between the components the d

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:48,159
u the r u may be problematic and

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,679
operators must have interoperability

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,039
the idea that you can have an open

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,240
ecosystem is fantastic and i'm very much

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:58,159
involved in open ecosystems but each

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,640
player in the ecosystem needs to be able

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,400
to see a path to business

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,320
and i've actually put a link um this

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,200
isn't in the version i sent url at the

00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,720
bottom

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,840
yeah we've got this thing called the

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
telecom ecosystem group which i'm a

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,080
co-founder

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,960
what we're trying to do there is

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,679
encourage startups to come into telecoms

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,720
and it's obvious that 5g and all of the

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,440
things with 5g

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,320
including openran and the core network

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,640
are going to be

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,120
huge opportunities for um the industry

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,679
um and the pandemic has only accelerated

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,880
um

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,400
for that but the challenges remain

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,600
right so i would say in summary i like

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:43,039
open ram i think there are challenges

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:46,320
to deliver the full openness vision

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,520
unless the operators in particular

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,720
take very strong action to define the

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,600
interfaces

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,039
and specifications so that there is

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,720
interoperability between

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,760
all of these entities not just the

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,080
network layer the control layers

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,360
um i hope that answers your question in

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,880
a very vague way

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,880
great uh look

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:14,400
also wants to know uh the following

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:18,000
um the role of

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,720
site reliability engineering with

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,720
concepts such as error budget and

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,159
service level objectives

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,159
in the context of telco

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,440
what was the what was the first the

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,360
first part

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,640
your thoughts in terms of the role

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,799
of sre which is side reliability

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,399
engineering

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,720
with concepts such as error budgets

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,360
and service level objectives in the

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,760
context of telco

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,480
i can't answer that um i'm not familiar

00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,440
enough with that

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,880
with that um i can find somebody that

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,399
can answer that question if you want to

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,039
contact me afterwards

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,000
okay thank you uh there is let me see

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,760
one more

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,080
or a couple more let me see if it's

00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,919
related so

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,480
uh so so for energetic career outlook

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,200
cloud and uh security plus telecom

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:20,559
combine our skills in high demand

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,600
would you say that is where

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:27,440
we're heading pandemic

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,200
and this is uh benjamin lopez

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,840
what was the last part of that comment

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,679
wrong uh what would you say that

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,360
this is where we are heading what's

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,720
pandemic

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,960
post kobe in terms of career objectives

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,039
whether it is cloud plus security plus

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,919
telecom

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,240
yeah absolutely so no question now that

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,360
um

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,080
[Music]

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,960
most most analysts now believe that the

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,000
pandemic

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,720
has kick-started a new a new era of

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,760
remote working

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,840
so uh if you look at articles in forbes

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,600
for example they are talking about a

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,159
significant

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,440
uh retention of remote working as being

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,840
normal

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
um that means we need richer

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,320
communications

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,120
right zoom uh and and the other

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,360
applications have have accelerated their

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,760
their their user friendliness

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,279
uh we're using bevy which i noticed for

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,960
example we clicked backwards and

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,360
forwards to the agenda

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,640
one of the issues i think that was

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,559
brought up by the first

00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,640
keynote speaker was how do we ensure

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,559
their serendipity

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,200
you know we how do we interact with each

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:40,080
other in a remote environment

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,919
for our conference last november we

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,039
tried to have a social event and we

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,840
tried to mimic

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,440
people moving around the conference uh

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,720
for example you've got an agenda you

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,440
click on join right

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,919
and you can have multiple rooms that's

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,320
great

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,760
but it's not it's still not there is it

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,640
yeah so how can we make

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,600
the the experience better that's going

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,600
to require

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:07,840
um avatar um 3d environments

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:10,960
um richer experiences

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:14,480
and so that is going to put more

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,679
emphasis on telecommunications and also

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,679
on security

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,360
right we know zoom for example is

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,559
compromised at the very beginning

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:25,840
um some very bad things happened in zoom

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:28,399
they quickly released um secured secured

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,840
um encryption and waiting rooms and

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,159
things like that

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,440
just an example we're just at the very

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,520
beginning

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,760
so telecommunications operators i'm very

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,480
much aware now that they have

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,880
a big opportunity to create the the

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,600
mechanisms by which we can have these

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,000
these these experiences and i'm excited

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:51,600
about it because

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,799
we can now bring in to our industry

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:58,080
people that live in central america

00:30:54,799 --> 00:31:01,440
as if they're living in

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,799
working in the next building right so so

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,640
this is exciting time

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,399
so yeah i think i think telecoms is

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,200
going to demand more

00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,559
uh software developers with the with the

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,960
right skills

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,159
having said that right the

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,240
infrastructure

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,679
you know the you know the wireless

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,320
network or the

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,960
or the cable network that's not going to

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,720
change

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,039
overnight right i'm talking about

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,120
most of the telecoms execs are talking

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:29,919
about how does telecoms move up the

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,919
value stack

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,039
right yeah so we're not talking about

00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,960
open ram

00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:37,840
we're talking about what runs over open

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,880
rand that's not google

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:42,880
it's att

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,080
so they want they want these rich

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,240
experiences to be

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
owned by the telecoms guys not

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,559
necessarily by

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,360
by facebook um instagram and and tick

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,159
tock

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,440
yeah yeah that requires these skills to

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,120
come into the industry so i think you

00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:01,679
will see that happening

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,840
