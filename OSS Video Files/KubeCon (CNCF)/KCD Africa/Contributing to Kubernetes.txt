Description: 
	Contributing to Kubernetes can be outright daunting. At the time I am writing this, there are over a thousand pull requests on the main Kubernetes repository. Where do you start? What’s a SIG? Do you need to have deployed something on Kubernetes? What if you don’t write code?! Don’t panic! This talk aims to make it easier for a beginner to get in the first pull requests in the Kubernetes community. It explains the different parts of the Kubernetes community and the various ways one can contribute.
In this talk, we will go over why you might want to contribute to Kubernetes, the different ways you can get involved(even if you don’t write code), how to get help when it is needed, what the different group in Kubernetes are and how they function together and how to get the first pull request merged!
