Title: Contributing to Kubernetes
Publication date: 2021-06-01
Playlist: KCD Africa
Description: 
	Contributing to Kubernetes can be outright daunting. At the time I am writing this, there are over a thousand pull requests on the main Kubernetes repository. Where do you start? Whatâ€™s a SIG? Do you need to have deployed something on Kubernetes? What if you donâ€™t write code?! Donâ€™t panic! This talk aims to make it easier for a beginner to get in the first pull requests in the Kubernetes community. It explains the different parts of the Kubernetes community and the various ways one can contribute.
In this talk, we will go over why you might want to contribute to Kubernetes, the different ways you can get involved(even if you donâ€™t write code), how to get help when it is needed, what the different group in Kubernetes are and how they function together and how to get the first pull request merged!

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,199
i think i uh

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
a bit a story before she starts her

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,240
session i was at

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,000

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,239
in 2019 and

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
a number of us nigerians and a couple of

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,440
africans you know

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,120
we usually recognize ourselves as

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,680
africans anywhere we go

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,239

within the ecosystem and conversations

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,520
started around how we can

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,000

at the end of this talk i hope at least

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,000
even if it's just one person that

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,159

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,360
i'm trying to push you guys to

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,879
contribute to open source and in

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,720
particular kubernetes

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,080
and yeah i'm just going to walk you

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,560
through the process and hopefully make

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
it

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
a bit easier for you to get started with

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
darts um

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,040
i'm going to try not to talk too much

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
and try to get

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,080
um leave a lot of time for questions at

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,200
the end so

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,360
yeah in sorry

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,440
ah let me present this okay

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,120
so this is basically an outline of the

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,319
talk i'm going to

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,000
tell you why and how to contribute to

00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,319
kubernetes

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,599
different groups in needs that make you

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,000
work um

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,840
how to select your first issue how to

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,760
make your first pull requests

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
you know different mentoring programs

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,920
and also how to grow

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,799
as a contributor in kubernetes i think

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,720
all these are like

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,400
important parts of how you can work

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,320
yourself up to contributing to

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,440
kubernetes

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,000
so um first off i know a lot of people

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,960
um i

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
i had bakari saying what kubernetes is

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,560
so hopefully

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,919
most people here at least just have a

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,960
general idea of

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,600
what kubernetes is um in short it is

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,840
used for

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
managing containers it's called an a

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,840
container or

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,120
orchestration framework or platform but

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
i'm not here to talk so much about

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,240
kubernetes for about contributing to it

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,919
so i'm going to tell you why so i don't

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,199
know if you know this ma'am here it's

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,639
basically something

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:54,160
unique developer sees um a new day

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,520
another opportunity to be

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,120
world-class so i think um a major reason

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
i would give you to contribute to

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,520
kubernetes is because you gained a world

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,120
class world-class experience

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,960
there are a lot of experienced

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
developers on kubernetes you have

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,639
googlers

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,960
you have people from aws microsoft a lot

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,440
of

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,320
you know big companies really investing

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,039
engineers

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,039
to contribute to kubernetes and when you

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,240
start contributing to kubernetes you

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,000
one way or the other you have the

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
opportunity to work with these people

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,560
they review your pull requests and not

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,800
just like on a code basis right

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
you get to collaborate with people

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,440
across different time zones right you

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,600
learn how to communicate and how to

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,440
collaborate with people who are not even

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
around you

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,280
get the commit is also very active yeah

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,039
the project has over 76k stars on github

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,960
it's very active project they're like in

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,199
the main repository they are over at our

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,240
example request open like right now

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,560
there are a lot of people bd focused on

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,880
kubernetes a lot of companies

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,880
you get to over time as you contribute

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,440
to kubernetes you get to meet people you

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
get to

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,120
you know build your network you know

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,600
outside where you are

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
so i really think that um contributing

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,400
to kubernetes has really helped me

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,919
to help anyone who actually says oh i

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
want to contribute to this project i

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,280
want to make changes

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,960
and you know i want to be active i think

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,880
if you try to contribute to kubernetes

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
yeah you definitely get more experience

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
and

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,680
also a lot of companies higher around

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,600
like kubernetes

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,440
the infrastructure you understand it

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,120
better and also there are like

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,280
a lot of job opportunities to around

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,880
humanities and you saying that oh i have

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,840
contributed to kubernetes this also

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,039
looks great on your portfolio

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,919
so um i'll i'll start off by saying that

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,520
it's okay if you're a little confused or

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,440
scared when you're starting out to

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,520
contribute to kubernetes

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,240
frankly it will be it'll be weird if you

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,080
weren't because cuban is a large project

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,360
they're a lot of people sometimes you

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,560
just look at it and you're like you

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,240
don't know where to start

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,840
so i think that's good that was

00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,319
basically me when i started i was like

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,560
whoa

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,160
this this project is like a lot like

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,039
it's been there for a long time and you

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,720
have like people

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,360
constantly contributing to you change

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,000
this stuff i like can i actually make a

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
change here

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
you get but like that's okay i think

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,280
that's

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,880
our initial reaction when we are coming

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,759
to something that is new when we're

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,960
stepping out of like

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,800
what we're used to when we're stepping

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,880
out of our comfort zone

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,160
so i think even if you feel scared even

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,880
if you feel confused

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,240
that's not a reason not to do it so i'm

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,919
just basically here story that if you're

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,479
feeling scared you're feeling confused

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,319
that's fine um you're not the first

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,479
you're not you're not alone in that uh

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,000
i contribute to cuban issues and even

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,000
now sometimes i'm trying to contribute

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,880
to like a new part of kubernetes and i'm

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,520
like

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,240
oh i'm not too sure what i'm doing but i

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
think you can

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,759
actually work through the confusion and

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,599
make a reasonable pull request like

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,960
the thing is if you make a pull request

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,599
there are people reviewing

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
your pull request and they won't let you

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,160
just do anyhow

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,000
they will actually review it and say

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
okay um you didn't do this right

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,440
or this is actually not where it's

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,039
supposed to be you have like some amount

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,479
of guidance from the community so i

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,759
think you should take on some comforts

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,160
on that

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,680
so um there are different ways to

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
contribute to kubernetes

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,919
it doesn't have to be code uh i i know

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,680
there are a lot of programmers on here

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,879
but even if you don't write code

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,639
like that's okay kubernetes has a lot of

00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,560
documentation if you're a technical

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
writer or even if you aren't

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
or you you just think like okay i don't

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,000
write code but i think i might like to

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
like write stuff um their documentation

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,280
is actually

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,279
very extensive they have like a blog

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,919
post they have like blog posts they have

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,719
like

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,320
a full whole website dedicated to

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,440
kubernetes because there are a lot of

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,880
moving parts

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,880
so if you're good with writing or you

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,279
could just try it out um

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,880
one thing i've learned is you know if if

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,080
you're just looking at an open source

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,440
project and you feel like

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,440
you're reading through the documentation

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,959
and something's unclear and

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,560
you think you can make it clearer like

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,600
just open your request for it it doesn't

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,519
matter like

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,760
if you're not if you don't think you're

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,160
a fully qualified technical writer

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,800
so even if you do design we have the sig

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,120
ui

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,839
which is um for the kubernetes dashboard

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,839
where

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,200
it's like a dashboard to display some

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,399
insights into what's going on

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,120
in your cluster you could also join in

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,800
um also it's a very large community

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,560
there's always efforts for

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,320
managing people managing projects

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
managing the community so if you think

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,880
your products

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,640
you are leaning towards project

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,839
management or community management

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,560
like that's still great there's

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,560
definitely space for you

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,800
there's like the kubernetes release

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,399
theme which sort of like coordinates and

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,640
kubernetes releases that happen like

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,000
four times every year and

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,360
you know it takes a lot of people

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,880
there's the release team is basically

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,560
people managing like oh

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,080
is this pull request going to get in

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,000
before you know the

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,120
the release is ready doesn't need

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
documentation

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,640
checking in with people who are supposed

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,399
to sell me pre-request for these changes

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,080
so yeah all those things are like

00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,519
project and community management so

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,920
if that's where you feel you can weigh

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,120
in like that's totally great

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,560
and also the main um kubernetes

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,920
repository is written in gold um

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,360
and people have this mistaking uh myself

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,200
that you have to know go

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,440
with to contribute to kubernetes as well

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:16,560
i feel good it's definitely a plus

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,360
if you write something like python java

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,040
we have client libraries for kubernetes

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,519
that are written in those languages

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,480
um the kubernetes website so it's

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
basically html

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,360
css you can get started from there there

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,279
are a lot of testing that goes on a lot

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,040
of testing that goes on in kubernetes so

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,040
you could also weigh in there

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,720
so yeah i hope you ever there also

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,000
marketing initiatives within the

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,680
kubernetes community

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,120
it's a very large community you know

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,519
they have social media like

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,560
there are so many different ways to

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,079
weigh in and

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,680
just joining in the community even if

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,800
you don't code it's still going to be

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
very valuable for you so there are

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,079
different groups

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,200
in kubernetes you have the special

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,360
interest groups

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,959
which are focused on a particular area

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,360
in kubernetes um

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,800
cube ctl is the command line tool for

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,079
interacting with kubernetes

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,880
api and you just seek

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:09,839
that special interest group cli is

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,839
focused on like

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,360
that and other cli tools that are built

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,360
around humanities

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,600
you have sick country backs which is

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
focused on um cuban um contributor

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
experience

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,240
um kibanis is a very welcoming community

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,680
they and putting some effort a lot of

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,480
efforts actually

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,079
to make as in contributing to humanity's

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,040
you know a better experience

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,640
so there's a whole um group that caters

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,240
to that just trying to get people to

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,519
contribute trying to make sure it's

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,880
it's like a smooth experience so there's

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,560
there's also something called working

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,079
groups these are not the only groups in

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,200
kubernetes but these are probably the

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,440
most relevant ones

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,640
um working working groups are like much

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,120
less they are

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,480
more temporary and they cut across

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,200
multiple sigs

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
um so something like the multi-tenancy

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,800
working group

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
is quite saga across signaled seek

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:05,440
storage and like a bunch of other ones

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,680
so yeah you can find out more about

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,279
each sig on the kubernetes community

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,160
repository if you can

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,800
i hope my screen is clear enough i can

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,560
see that

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,399
there's a lot of like there are

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,480
different folders for each sig

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
each of them sort of explaining what the

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,920
sig is about

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,360
um how you can contribute to them and

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,600
different stuff like that

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,680
so um it also has to get the

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,880
contributors guide which is also

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,800
if you're just starting out you should

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,040
definitely read that uh

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,320
so this coming this reposition is

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,519
basically like a treasure for someone

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,839
who wants to contribute because

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,959
you can't really get a lot of

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,680
information uh you can

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,040
read up of on the different sigs the

00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,560
different working groups

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,079
ug means user groups so yeah you can

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
definitely just take a look at this

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,959
repository maybe spend some time trying

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,720
to find out like

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,600
what the different stuff is about and

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
you should get involved with your vanity

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,440
so first you should probably be on the

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,560
slack channel you can invite yourself

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,920
at the url to speed on the screen

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,480
slug k it as the io

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,240
uh you should check out some seeks and

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,680
try to find one that is alive

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
aligned with something you're interested

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,720
in uh or something that's related to

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,639
your job

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,959
or you know just speak around only if

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,519
you don't know like you're not tied to a

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,880
sick

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:27,279
you can basically try out different see

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,680
to find out okay these are probably the

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,680
ones like i like what they do and i feel

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,440
like i can contribute to them

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,959
you want to join their meeting lists you

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,959
want to join their slack channel they

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,680
are like each seat has like a slack

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,600
channel

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,519
where they discuss like issues focused

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,920
on the area that

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
they handle so you should also try and

00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,360
join their meetings

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,079
which they try to make it very

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,320
comfortable time for like everybody

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,279
so if you can it might be links for you

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,120
it might not

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
so if you can't join their meeting times

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
you know ask questions

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,880
introduce yourself most of them are

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
welcoming contributors

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,560
most of them are actually excited to

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,720
have people join them and

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:09,440
be interested in what they do so i'll

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,079
definitely encourage you to do that

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
then to make your first pull request you

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,720
have to pick an

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,040
issue so you can filter if you're unable

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,120
to

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,040
pick a sig um i think when i first

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,680
started i was not able to decide on

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,639
which seat to contribute to it was like

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,519
still all new to me but some people sort

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,720
of like they knew

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,040
or it just caught their eye so

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,560
i started by filtering for good first

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,680
issues and hopefully had issues i'm

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,839
picking those ups

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
those were like low-hanging fruits i

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,399
could easily get started beats

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,440
so you can filter the main repository

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,240
for it

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,920
if you have decided on a sig it's most

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,519
likely they have their own repository so

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,839
you can also go there it doesn't have to

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,519
be

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
the main humanities repository that

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,760
you're contributing to

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,160
and even on the main cubanist repository

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,240
each

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,680
each issue is labeled with the sig that

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
is consigned with it

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,519
so you can actually filter by the seek

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,320
that you want to you can also

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,800
have to see like okay you can join the

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
channel

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,959
introduce yourself like oh i'm a new

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,680
contributor i'm looking to join your sig

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,000
i'm looking to pick one or two issues um

00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
you

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,760
you kind like just ask like just

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,959
communicates uh

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,040
you probably should not do that on the

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,360
general channel but the seed channels

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,519
are

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,440
actually good ways to also find out what

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,279
i was important to the sea gun

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,639
you know those are probably the issues

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,079
that that they try to

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,600
you know get contributors for then

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,759
you could read through the kubernetes

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,880
documentation and if you find

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,279
small typos comments that you know you

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,560
could actually it could be as simple as

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,519
that your first pull request doesn't

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,519
have to be

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,680
large it doesn't have to be this massive

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,120
change most times you know you want to

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,240
keep it small especially when you're

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,440
starting and

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,440
because you probably don't understand

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,000
the whole system so you probably want to

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,920
start small

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,199
so updating if you see uh if you're

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,720
reading through the documentation

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,240
and you're like oh this could be

00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,240
explained better or

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,320
that's a typo you can't like you can't

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,320
just make a pull request for that and

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,199
as simple as that your first request is

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:14,079
in and then you grow from there

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,079
uh so there's a pull request process

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,519
to get your pull request margining you

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,839
have to sign the

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,399
contributor license agreement it's not

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,720
difficult to do is literally just like

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,720
a couple of clicks it's not it's not an

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,759
extremely complicated process it's just

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:32,079
you just sign it then you need a

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,199
kubernetes member to apply the

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:38,399
okay to test label

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,240
on your you need a humanities member to

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,759
apply the okay to test email on your

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,560
request so it's basically saying like

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,920
okay there cause a lot of tests run for

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,160
each pull request

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,959
to validate it um just to verify your

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,079
changes

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:56,720
so exactly saying okay um

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,000
this pull request is like you can't you

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,639
can run the test on it

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,079
um most of these these labels they're

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,959
applied by the robot so

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,559
when a member comments something like

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
this slash okay to test

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,160
on your pull request it means okay the

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,120
robot now acts on that he applies the

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,000
label and then

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,439
you know allows the test to run so

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,319
there's also something called

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,240
um lgtm which means looks good to me is

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,799
applied by a reviewer someone who has

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
reviewed

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,319
your changes uh probably the person has

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,199
made some comments you've

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,679
responded to the changes and it's like

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,240
okay

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,880
your request is good like it looks good

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,840
um

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,600
i think you've done an okay job on this

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,880
then the slash approve

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,120
is saying oh it can get meshed now

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,160
so it says okay basically means your

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,679
work is done probably

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,760
maybe you have to rebase your pull

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
requests and squash your comments but

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,880
it means okay like your job is almost

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,840
done you're almost there

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,880
and then sometimes because of how big

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
kubernetes is

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,640
it might be you might make a request and

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,679
not get some traction on it

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,080
and that's okay there's something called

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,679
the

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:06,000
pr review channel for um

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,600
it's called it's called pr review so

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,400
it's basically to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,080
sort of like get get more eyes on your

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,720
request so you can just

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,160
like say oh i have this request then can

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,600
someone take a look

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,720
you know and also um the the robot tries

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,840
to apply

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,760
the correct um seek that your

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,360
change is associated with because they

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:30,400
are going to be the ones to review it

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,120
and approve it so um you can

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,960
just join the seed and say oh i have

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,039
this purpose open is this something you

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,440
guys want can someone take it look

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,120
and then as a last resort you can also

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,600
ping the person who opened the issue

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,360
if you are making a proquest for an

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,559
issue you can't okay just ping the owner

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,039
and say okay

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,360
you made this issue and i i just opened

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,760
the request for it and there's been

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:55,679
like no traction in it so far but i want

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
to say that i also want to say that when

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,039
you

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,080
com when you ping people on slack

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,080
uh they might be in different time zones

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,600
so if you don't get a reply immediately

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,200
that's absolutely fine

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,880
um you should probably just give it some

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,440
time the person might not be

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,880
available person might be on vacation or

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,160
yeah i'm just saying like don't feel

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,840
discouraged if you don't get an

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,799
immediate response from

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,280
people and you know try to communicate

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,320
in

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,640
the channels more than like dms unless

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,919
if

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,919
you know you guys have been coming to

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,840
the communication for some

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,120
yeah uh so if you don't get a risk a

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,559
responsibility

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,760
that's fine the person might be in a

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,880
different time zone maybe the person is

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,280
going to sleep in

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,080
so yeah just apply some patience and

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,080
definitely

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,200
you will eventually get your opponent

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,679
pull request matched

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,679
so i want to spend some time talking

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,080
about the contributor ladder

00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,559
so once you make your first request

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,280
you're basically a contributor

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,320
to cuba he says oh i forgot to put some

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,320
diagram

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,320
but yeah you're contributing to

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,640
kubernetes then

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,679
after some time if you are active and

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,440
you make more

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,039
multiple requests you know if you join

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
like the release team

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,200
and become a shadow which is some sort

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
of someone that um shadows the release

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,760
leads and like helps out with other

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,400
attacks

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,120
and such like active involvement with

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,360
the community

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,520
actually pushes you to become it's like

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,520
it helps you become a member for you to

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,200
become a member you need like two

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,480
community members to like

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,240
okay you sort of so that will be tough

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
if you're actually being active you know

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,640
you

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,600
actually get to meet people as you make

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,360
requests join meetings join the seat

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,640
so definitely one or two people you

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,280
definitely shouldn't be too difficult

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
people

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,799
too difficult to find two people from

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
two different companies

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
that will like say okay i think she's

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
doing a great one

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
she's doing a great job like she should

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:52,480
be a member then the next step

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
is like your reviewer means you get to

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,720
review other people's

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,280
requests and apply the lgtm label on

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,320
different

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,320
requests so each repo

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,840
has like different people that are

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,080
reviewers and approvers like

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,120
it's it's not across like the whole

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,960
organization

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,640
it's more like scoped to like a

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,000
particular repository

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,760
so yeah if you're active in a sig

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,120
and you're making a lot of changes and

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,240
you're really knowledgeable about what's

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,080
going on there

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,480
they can easily you can actually just

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,120
request oh i want to be a reviewer and

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,480
you know if the the leads of the seat

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,720
can't see your contribution

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,320
they'll probably make you one the next

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,880
step is you can be an approver

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,720
yeah you actually get to say okay this

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,919
request looks good enough to

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,679
be merged in the repository

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,840
there's also like co-chairs of

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,840
communities there are sig leads

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,600
uh so yeah i think

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,840
like it's a great way like you can

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,679
definitely see yourself progressing

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,039
and i just want to see that you don't

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,200
have to pressure yourself

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,360
this is just the ladder but it's not

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,840
like you you can't like

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,440
like for me i've been contributing to

00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:04,000
kubernetes for like

00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,240
over a year i remember i'm not a

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,559
reviewer in any repository yet

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,159
it's just like you can't do it in your

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,400
own time there's no pressure

00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,600
and you don't have to say okay this week

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,280
i want to be a reviewer

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
next to god to be on a provider it's not

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,760
like you cannot go post it's basically

00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,000
just something that happens over time as

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,280
you become more and more active in the

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,360
kubernetes community

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,039
so yeah i'm just going to go over that

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,919
again it's good to progress

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,360
your contributions in the community you

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,720
should not just do it because

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,640
you want to be a reviewer you want to be

00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,159
an approver i think that's the wrong

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,480
motivation just

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,440
be active care about the parts that

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,240
you're doing and

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
i think these things just call me time

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,760
so

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,520
yeah i want to

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,640
round up by talking about mentorship

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:53,360
programs for different people

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,799
so there is google sum of code google

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,760
sum of code is how

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,720
personally i start contributing to

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,000
kubernetes

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:05,200
uh i wanted to apply um to

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,520
a kubernetes project under the cncf

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,280
so i'll definitely encourage students to

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,200
apply for google some of code

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,559
it was like a great experience for me

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,360
all around like

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:16,799
one of my mentors was a googler get out

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,840
work that we've worked we are we are

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,600
working now

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,919
so i think if your students should

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,559
definitely apply but i want to also add

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,640
in that

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,640
the applications are closed right now i

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
think

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,480
but if you start applying if you start

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
contributing to humanities now

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,039
and you know you try to grow your

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,480
contribution contributions now

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,799
you get like a very nice

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,600
margin over other applicants because

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,600
you're familiar with what's going on

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,600
so if you can't start contributing now

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,960
don't wait till like next year when the

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,400
new application starts

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,320
so if you can start contributing now

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,640
please do so i and also

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,520
just also for the benefits of you know

00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,720
learning

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,200
and growing your skills there are other

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,279
ones

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,559
there's the lfx mentorship there's

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,559
outreachy

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,559
there's google seasonal docs for people

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:08,799
who are technical writers

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,679
yeah so just checking on any of them

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,000
there's a

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,279
repository where you can you know see

00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,360
the different

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,799
mentoring programs that i've linked

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,159
there so yeah

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:19,760
i think coming under a mentorship

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,400
program is also great you can also

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,080
contribute

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
outside of this mentorship program it

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,840
doesn't have to be

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,520
but some of them are paid and i think it

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,200
can be quite encouraging just to be paid

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,799
for like contributing to open source

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,240
yeah it could be like a great way to

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,720
start off

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:38,400
uh so i want to summarize by saying

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,760
you can't become a contributor to

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,919
kubernetes

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,440
it's not that difficult i know it could

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,320
be like very challenging

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,360
at first but i it gets easier you pick

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,720
an issue

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,559
you work towards it you try and

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,960
communicate with people

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:55,120
you join a sig and you know try and

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,240
become an active contributor

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,600
so i'm going to end now

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,679
you should take a look at the

00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,120
contributor contributing guide

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,039
that the country backs members have put

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,080
together which is very very helpful for

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,080
new contributors

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,960
there's also a contributor sheets where

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,440
you can get a lot of insights to like

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,720
what just goes on as a contributor yeah

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
so i've linked both of them i think

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,039
these are very active

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,640
and very helpful links and you should

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,039
definitely check them out and you can

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,120
also

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,360
reach out to me i'm on cuban initial

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,600
questions

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,000

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,000

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:01,800
let me check the chats if we have

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,950
questions

00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,950
[Music]

okay we don't have any questions in the

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,440
chat yet

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:18,640
awesome presentation um one question i

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,559
uh would like to ask is so

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,480
you know sometimes when you want to

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,520
contribute to kubernetes

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,799
it has a lot of past when you want to

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,480
get started

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:33,760
yeah sometimes you have no idea okay

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,080
where should i start from is it docs

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,080
is it

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,480
the helm charts easy which one so what

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,159
advice would you have for

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,760
someone that okay it just goes to the

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,080
project and wants to start

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,840
where exactly should they start from oh

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,799
you can you can start from the cube and

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,799
it says

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,039
main repository that's the the quality

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,440
case slash kid that's kubernetes

00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,679
github.com

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
you try and filter for good fast issues

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,159
help on head issues

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,279
uh that's you can just basically kick it

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,000
off like that

00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,520
if you are coming from maybe you build a

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,120
lot of cli tools

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,880
then you should check out six here

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,960
license that will be more aligned

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:17,760
with your interest so you probably get

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,520
to work on the cube ctl command line too

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,039
if you come if you're writing a lot of

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,679
documentation

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,679
you should definitely join sick dogs ask

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,240
them oh i'm a new contributor

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,000
i'm looking to join you guys you know

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,799
where can i get started yeah

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,480
and if if as in if you don't know what

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:35,600
else to do then just join the conceived

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,279
country backs

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,960
they try to they also try to make it

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,960
easy for new contributors to

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,080
get started like they have a lot of like

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,640
very low

00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,960
like it's easy to make put requests to

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,039
that community repo they have like just

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,880
like docs and stuff like that so i think

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,880
at as the last resort

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,320
you can actually just join country bags

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,799
and say okay i want to be a contributor

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,000
okay awesome so that's contributex is

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,520
like uh oh

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,480
it's contributes like uh where someone

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,799
that doesn't have

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,880
any experience with code or anything and

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,360
doesn't even have an idea where to start

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,480
country base is the best place for them

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,080
to start yeah i

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,159
i think that's that's that's okay you

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,320
can join them because they are basically

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,200
around making the contributor experience

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,399
easier

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,120
and smooth so you probably get some some

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,880
like some help and direction from them

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,360
okay awesome we have a question for

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,279
sebastian who is watching from youtube

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,559
he says what would be the future you

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,159
would want to see

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:39,840
in the next q when it is released uh

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:44,720
features yeah like because i've been

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,720
every um yeah like a couple of

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,000
of release features that i was looking

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,919
for to get matched

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,360
but it didn't because the people that

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:52,720
are working on them probably didn't have

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,159
the bandwidth

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,880
to get them in but basically if you go

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:58,720
to

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,600
if you're curious if you're more curious

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,159
about about them

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,000
different like feature proposals there's

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,559
something called kubernetes

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,720
enhancements which are basically like

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,000
proposals people make

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:19,360
for like new features in kubernetes uh

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,360
let me get evening sorry a second

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:30,080
so yeah

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:33,440
let me see so there's this

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,279
okay uh let me copy the link

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,720
okay i don't know i'll just paste it in

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,080
this chart yeah

00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,600
so i'll send it back and add it

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,520
enhancements you can like check the

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,120
features there like read up

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,039
probably it comes most times it comes

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,679
with like extensive documentation on

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,080
what new features the ones added or what

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,000
enhanced for me there's this cube ctl

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,720
debug feature that i'm looking forward

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,720

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,080
it's been open for some time but i'm

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,240
looking forward to it

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:02,080
getting like some traction in the

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,880
community and also

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,000

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,760
cluster add-ons

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,520
but it's not it's not related to the

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,440
main humanities repository

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,799

at first yeah but is there a feature

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,679
that you would love to see even if it

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:34,960
doesn't exist yet okay

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,960
but when you mention cube ctl debug he

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:42,159

let me see this is the website report

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,559

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,440

even if you don't write food that's okay

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,159
