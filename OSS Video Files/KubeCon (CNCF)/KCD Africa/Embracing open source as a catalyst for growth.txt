sharing what life used to be for me um

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,480
prior to learning about open source i

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,800
would want to

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,879
actually tell you a story of you know

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,440
something that happened recently

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,920
so uh i think that was like two weeks

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,959
ago

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,599
or three weeks ago a very cool

00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
saturday morning i was basically on my

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,040
couch

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,560
and i was reflecting back on how i

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,920
started basically

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,560
you know how yeah i came from i was able

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,920
to like move

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,360
from zero to hundred and you know it

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,599
struck me

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,480
how open source was you know a big part

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,599
of what you know people take me from

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,319
being

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,799
a video call notice to fellow parts

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,000
being

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,720
you know very like

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,560
very good uh to feel about and then you

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
know it just came to my mind that

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,920
open source actually changed my life for

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,920
good

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,080
and then i went on twitter and i tweeted

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,159
about it and to my greatest surprise

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
you know you had you know subtractions i

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,720
mean you could see

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,599
like 175 likes just one tweets and five

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,439
comments

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,000
and i think the most interesting part

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,319
was this particular comment

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
so someone commented on the trade and

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,439
actually mentioned

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,959
that open source community changed

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:11,120
his or her life too

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,239
and you know that actually struck me you

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,720
know

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,439
actually i thought it was just me but

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,079
you know

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,639
after seeing this comment i actually

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,600
knew that

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,800
oh it's not just me actually there are a

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,320
lot of people

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,880
that open source has actually had

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,479
some impact in their lives in one way or

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,240
the other

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,919
and yeah uh that brings me uh

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,320
to how it all began basically

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,160
so basically you know before the dawn uh

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,040
before i knew what open source was

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,479
and i was basically 30 i was in 20 in

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,639
college i was in computer science

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,440
computer science in school

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,199
and i wanted at the time i wanted to

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,520
just be a freelance web developer you

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,919
know

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,720
just wanted to start up my own web

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,919
agency

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,280
and just hire people and just

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:06,400
build you know websites for people and

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,039
that was basically what i you know

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
dreamt to be at the time and at the time

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,560
i had

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,280
zero understanding of what and

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,560
of course i had no opportunity for

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,479
careers

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:24,639
so that was the position i found myself

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,840
up until um yeah uh so basically

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,360
up until i think uh january

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
january to february 2020. so at the time

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
i had

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,600
moved to my fourth year in college and

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
you know i was

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,840
i was asking myself a lot of questions

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:43,680
you know so how do i move from here

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,639
you know actually is this enough for me

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,600
is being a freelancer enough for me is

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
that where i

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
want to go and you know at the time i

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,479
had

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
several opportunities so what it meant

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,080
was you know even getting

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,360
someone that i complete websites from

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,840
was

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,880
was very very difficult it was very

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,080
difficult

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,160
so of course i was young i was dumb

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,440
i was broke at the time so i mean

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:11,520

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,160
i told myself i was going to master the

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,040
skills i was going to code every single

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,800
day

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,399
i was also going to contribute to open

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,160
source because i had already learned

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,160
what open source was

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,839
and of course you know some books and

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,560
some coding tests i

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,200
have to do as well so i was super pumped

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,800
i was

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:20,399
highly motivated to push and

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,279
become the best version of myself and

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,320
yeah that's actually you know drove me

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,880
into

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
coding every single day so and my

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,360
friends we actually started this

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,320
thing called you know i think on on

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,160
ending days of code basically so like we

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,360
are quoting every single day

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,160
and we do we need to decap to

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,680
how long we would be coding basically so

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,560
along the line i learned about

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
the lfx membership program you know as

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,480
probably

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,880
as you have seen on previous slides i

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
my plan was to continue to g-suck and i

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,720
applied to gsoc of course

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,399
but then i didn't get into gsu along the

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,800
line i learned about the lfx mentorship

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
program

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,680
and it was actually um through a

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,480
community i belonged to on on one

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,320
saturday

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,160
so at the time i was this on this

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
whatsapp group you know a few weeks

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,920
a young vibrant um open source

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,200
enthusiast

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,360
and eventually i that was where i got

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,399
the link to the lfx mentorship program

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,640
of course i applied and

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,160
you know if prior to the application i

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,600
went to do like a list of

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,399
projects that i passed specie and

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,880
one project caught my attention and that

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
was

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,480
the thanos project so basically you know

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
i've

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,839
always been doing fronted web

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,000
engineering

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:44,640
for a very long time and so projects

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
project topics related to that and then

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,519
looking for me i found

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,800
this uh issue on thanos which was

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,880
you know professionally building

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,480
you know for the thanos documentation

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,519
site and then i was

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,079
i was super excited because uh i i saw a

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,279
project

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,399
i felt i could contribute to and

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,440
you know i immediately um commented on

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,160
the threads uh

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,760
you know right from there i started

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,120
picking up interest on that project and

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,920
i started like doing research

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,240
immediately and trust me um at the time

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,320
you know i had zero expectations that i

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,399
would be selected

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,000
i was just genuinely interested of

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,600
course i was being hopeful to get

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,360
selected of course or

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,240
or generally interested and i wanted to

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,320
just contribute to this project

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:39,360
and you know basically i think

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,680
you know you don't have to

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,640
start big basically you just have to

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,920
start small and

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:49,200
show love and interest uh

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,480
oh sorry okay so yeah um

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,519
so of course uh eventually i got

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,240
accepted

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,279
into the program and you know i spent

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,920
like

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,320
a couple of months three to four months

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,279
you know

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
contributing to the tennis projects and

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,839
while i was

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,839
you know when i joined while i was

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,680
contributing i noticed you know

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,000
there was some other mentees that were

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,480
also contributing to tunnels as well

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
and i wanted to like work with them

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,360
because i

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
i thought i was walking in the side of

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,279
just me

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,920
trying to you know like work on this

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,000
project

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,519
and i felt you know maybe i could reach

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,639
out to this

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,079
uh other mentees and probably just sync

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,399
up and just

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,760
work together and collaborate together

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,120
and then i reached out to them

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,560
and then he bonded right from the first

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,120
day so we waited um so i was able to

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,399
create this initiative called the thanos

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,160
i and my friends

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,680
of course so we created this uh

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,959
initiative called the tunnels mexico's

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,000
friday hangout

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,360
so basically you know he meet every

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,800
friday would you try to reflect on

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
what we are able to achieve for that

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,079
week you know what our plans are for the

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,600
next week and

00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:06,079
of course uh we also you know have

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
chats about you know our careers and how

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,120
we could

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,160
you know basically improve ourselves and

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,680
from time to time

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,399
you know we invited like open source

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,399
maintainers

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,360
within the space so we invited

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:22,000
maintainers from the communities project

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,720
the cortex project from thanos of course

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,079
and from kubernetes and so on

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,200
so it was fun was really fun was was i

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,040
think it

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:37,519
was the highlights of my um

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:40,639
i stay as mit attends

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,440
and yeah uh eventually i completed my

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,639
project

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,639
of course it was it took months and it

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,680
took a lot of perseverance a lot of hard

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,560
work because i've

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,000
not done something like that before i

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:53,600
mean like i've always been a front-end

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,920
developer but then building

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,079
it completely automated too that could

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,680
you know do some form of professional

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,240
uh for the channel certification site

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,639
but something i had zero clue about

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
but then i was you know i i believed in

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,600
myself i knew

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
if i could put in the time and hard work

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,279
and experience i could get things

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,760
done and of course i did um and you know

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,120
when my project was finally merged to

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,519
the thanos

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,399
corps or to the town of repo i literally

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,600
dropped on twitter

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,880
and i tweeted you know um how excited i

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,600
was

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,199
and to my great surprise it also got a

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,560
lot of attractions as well

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,120
i mean for all you can see here you can

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,639
see 253 likes

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,240
it was huge it is huge

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:44,079
and yeah um after you know

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,440
i shed this uh

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:49,440
i checked this tweet i basically

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,120
i knew the next step for me was to get a

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,000
job because basically i was

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,079
calling on my kind i was in college next

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,399
step for me was to join the company and

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,360
because i had contributed to open source

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,279
to tunnels

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,440
i wanted to remain within the space i

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,199
wanted to work with the company

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
that is open source i wanted to work on

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,680
an open source project

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,320
and you know basically i wanted to you

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,880
know

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,079
remain within the space and then you

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,360
know i learned about

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,959
about a company called grafana labs and

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,639
basically my encounter with graphene

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:24,399
labs was through

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,839
the observability con events that

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,000
loves i think around every year

00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,600
so i learned about the observability

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,160
called i registered and i

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
of course the events really opened my

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,560
eyes

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,160
into you know what observability was and

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,959
the opportunities

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,600
within the observability space and that

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,800
actually

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:50,320
you give like interest

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,560
you know into me diving deep into the

company i get to learn about the company

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,600
and you can see to know how i could be

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,720
part of the company

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,360
and the interesting part was it actually

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,959
took uh ticked you know ticked off most

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,839
of the things i was looking for

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,000
they are completely remote first

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,920

before sending that application i was

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,399
scared because i felt i wasn't good

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,120
uh i i got into graphing labs

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:11,679
as a software engineer i currently work

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,039
you know basically

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,079
seeing yeah micros

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,400
and yeah uh you know sooner

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,079
soon after i joined grandfather labs um

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
i was still very much active with the

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,160
same

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,120
space and you know along the lines i

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,559
learned about

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,799
the cncf ambassadors program so i

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,160
i was quite excited about it as well you

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,720
know i felt

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,600
i could be part of this uh and then i

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,640
applied as well

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,160
i applied to the css program and

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,799
you know at the time i didn't really

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,840
know how huge it was i didn't know the

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:51,200
caliber of people that you know that are

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:54,320
being accepted as uh as ambassadors so

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,679
after i sent in my application i went to

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,360
the cncf site

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:03,360
and then i saw a list of the ambassadors

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,919
you know i i mean i lost hope basically

00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,799
because i

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
i mean i was seeing like engineers at

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,320
microsoft

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,039
and google chief cloud architects you

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,120
know

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,200
people that have lots and lots of

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,200
experiences i was like you know

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
there is no way i was going to get him

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:22,400
basically there is no way

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,280
well you know to my greatest surprise i

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,760
got a mail

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,400
that i was accepted into the ambassadors

00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,200
program i was super excited because at

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
the time

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:35,919
i think you know we had not

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,360
had a cncf ambassador from west africa

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,440
so what it meant was

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,640
i was like the first in east africa

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
which

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:45,760
was huge for me because basically it

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,280
basically promises an opportunity for me

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:50,160
to make a lot more impact

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
because i've always been value driven

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,559
right from

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:56,160
day one so so yeah i of course i went on

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,120
tv as well and i treated

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,520
you know how excited i was about getting

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,960
into the ambassadors program

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,679
and yeah um basically i'll be ending the

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,720
story here

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,840
um but i would want to end with

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,120
some few key takeaways

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,919
so basically this is my journey this is

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,520
my story

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,360
and i know it's different for different

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,880
people but then

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,480
i i actually took out time to reflect on

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,840
my journey and actually

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,000
you know document what i think

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,840
like helped me you know get to the level

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,559
where i am here and i feel if you should

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,559
follow the same

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,960
so number one is share openly

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,760
so because it's open source it's highly

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,679
important to

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,000
cultivate start open culture yourself

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,000
make it part of your personality i mean

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,080
for what you could see

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,520
i i mean like right from the beginning

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,679
of the slides i

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,880
always been tweeting you know i've

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,000
always been sharing

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,480
um basically what has been going on and

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,360
trust me people are watching people

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,159
actually looking

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,799
people are actually monitoring you and

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,640
yeah

00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:13,840
just uh open share open you know

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,600
basically embrace open source you know

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,200
as your personality basically

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,120
and the second one is take

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,120
responsibility

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,440
so tech research taking responsibility

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,320
is

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,360
quite an important skill both as a

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,240
software engineer and

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,480
also as an open source

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,600
enthusiasts or anyone interested in open

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,799
source because

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,919
basically in open source you know

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,000
um it is expected you take full

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,080
responsibility of wherever you

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
are you are planning to work on or

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,320
whatever you are assigned to do

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,440
so i think it's a very very important

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,000
skill set to

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,799
embrace and then the next is you know if

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,120
you can

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,799
apply to open source mentorship programs

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,640
so there are a lot of

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,600
a couple of open source mentorship

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,880
programs like lfx mentorship program

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,290
which is open for both students and

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,420
i think

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:12,420
[Music]

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
experienced engineers as well so long as

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,000
you are quite new to the open source i

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
think you can participate

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,200
within the lfx mentorship program i

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,320
don't know if that's still the case

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,360
but i during my own time that was how it

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,360
was structured

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,880
you know there is giselle for students

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,840
in university

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,520
there is outreach for basically

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,799
underrepresented folks

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,200
within the community uh there are a lot

00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,880
more there is google summer of talks

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,840
i mean if you are interested in

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,280
technical writing and technical

00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,960
you can actually contribute to open

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,360
source by participating in the google

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,159
summer

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,039
thoughts program and a lot more and then

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,880
the

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,400
another point is to collaborate with

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,440
others

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,440
i mean from what i mentioned you know

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,520
while i was contributing to the tennis

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,159
project i was able to reach out to

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,720
others

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,760
and trust me trust me it was the best

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:08,559
decision

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,600
i have made till date i mean we still

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,400
talk

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,039
today we meet once every month to

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
discuss

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,039
and share ideas and become best of

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,039
friends

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,799
you know basically so it's very

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,919
important to learn how to collaborate

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,840
with others

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,240
and that brings me to the next point

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:29,120
which is joining the community

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,799
i mean i can't even i can't over

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,440
emphasize

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,960
like how community has really been a

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
huge part of my growth

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,159
as a software engineer and i i think

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,360
you know if you if you are really really

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,480
interested in going

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,320
far and you are really interested in

00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,000
becoming the best version of yourself i

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,760
would highly advise you join the

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960

you know within the ecosystem i mean

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,919
like now we have like the cncf

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,280
community for for most of us interested

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,960

africa

00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:09,760
and there is lots more open source

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,080

let me just pronounce good man let me

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,480
not spoil the rest of

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,840
me he says great session of it and i

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,400
think there has been quite a lot of

00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,799
glowing comments uh

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:03,840
on on twitter also now a quick question

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,960
um how have you dealt with

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,400
impostor syndrome i know it's uh

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,159
it's a major thing that most people

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,360
struggle with especially when you come

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:15,279
from an environment

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:19,039
where you probably struggle or

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,640
feel as if you are not capable within a

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:24,960
particular group and you now get

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,640
to an international company how do you

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,440
manage impostor syndrome

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,720
yeah yeah that's i think that's a very

00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:35,440
wonderful

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,400
question actually i wrote about it on my

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,760
personal blog

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:44,799
about there so maybe i could also share

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:47,200
the link probably after this session

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,640
um so when i joined grafana labs of

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,960
course i

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,000
i felt like a new poster in fact i still

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:55,039
do um

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,840
to be honest i still do but i think what

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:59,520
has helped me

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,400
was me taking time to reflect on

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,039
other achievements how far i've come so

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,520
basically

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,799
what i try to do is i try to actually

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,880
reflect back and see

00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,919
okay i've actually done this i've

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,159
actually done that

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,080
actually done this in the past so

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,279
because i've been able to do this in the

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,520
past

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,799
it's also analytics that i can actually

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,080
pass this holder

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,880
so that is one and then second part is

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,840
you know i try to you know have

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,039
conversations

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,840
you know with people with the company so

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:36,080
i know for sure like i work here very

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,640
similar i know for sure that

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,679
most of the seniors must have gone

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,159
through

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,840
that particular stage and i try to have

00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,679
some conversations with them

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,120
and you know tell them that hey this is

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,520
how i feel you know

00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,720
this is what i'm feeling basically and

00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,880
it's

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,320
so reassuring to actually learn that

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,520
they also feel the same way

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,720
and they also have felt at some points

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,960
in their career

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,399
so i think basically speaking of uh and

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,279
reaching out you know

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,720
also it helps in scenarios like that and

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,840
then of course uh

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:12,960
believing in yourself it's hard

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,320
it's hard to believe in oneself but i

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,279
think you just have to

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,760
because if you don't so we want you so

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:21,360
yeah

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,399
i think that's like my few tips on

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,360
how i was able to fight this

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,399
year awesome yeah i don't know question

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,520
one thing

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,640
i think most people struggle with

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:38,640
is taking feedback feedback

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,520
because most times we are from different

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,039
cultures

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,520
and we speak differently there are some

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,799
people

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,520
who are direct when they share their

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,880
opinion

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,360
directly you can feel offended sometimes

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,520
but

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,960
they don't know it as an offense or

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,559
something wrong because

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
that's how they share that is how they

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,520
communicate how

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,880
what's your experience with feedback and

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,600
how do you manage

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,520
when someone is direct to you or not

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,880
necessarily confrontational but the

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:12,880
feedback

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,320
looks direct yeah that's also a very

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,360
very good question so

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,399
i i've i've had a couple of experiences

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,440
about you know receiving feedback

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,240
and i think for me personally it's

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,440
basically

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,760
me knowing that i know nothing

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,799
so the fact that i know that i know

00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,880
nothing

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,480
means that i know for sure that there

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,120
are a lot of experts there are a lot of

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,720
people

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,679
that lose way more than i do and what i

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,600
try to do is

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:47,120
i try to um i try to have

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,919
uh usually held beliefs

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,799
basically so i know for sure okay this

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,279
is my belief

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,000
this is what i think it is but then it's

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,600
completed without so

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,840
i am a huge believer in experiences so

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,159
the facts that i know that i've had a

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,559
couple of experiences means that

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,080
you know this more than i do and in

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,080
scenarios like that

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,520
i i know for sure all i get to do is

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,720
just to listen and

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,840
to just take whatever you're actually

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,559
trying to

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,919
you know tell me basically so so yeah i

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,039
think basically what has

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,039
done what

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,000
knowing that i am still starting out

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,880
this journey

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,440
has actually been absorbed feedback and

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,240
also

00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,520
i try to also make sure that the person

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,399
giving the feedback

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,919
has like has suffered a domain knowledge

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,919
on what's he or she

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,600
is giving in the first place because if

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,440
you have zero knowledge about this and

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,640
then you're giving your feedback

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,679
you know on something you click you have

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,080
a reach about

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,519
then it makes no sense basically because

00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
you have several knowledge

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,200
so i try to as much as make sure that

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,240
the person

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,279
has a lot of experiences and

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,880
that could actually make me select

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:13,279
i'm so careful so yeah um having with

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,279
the help

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,840
i think it does awesome

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,559
yeah one last question i want to ask is

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,519
um

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,120
there's this thing uh that happens quite

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,919
a lot lately there are lots of

00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,880
announcements

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,760
on twitter people are doing a lot of

00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,000
great things

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,519
which is really exciting for our

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,360
community

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,320
apart from people companies raising

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,480
funds a lot more people are getting

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,399
international opportunities that is what

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,480
we want and that is what

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:46,159
as a community we want to happen because

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,720
there is a lot of false leadership

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,399
on the continent but that access to

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,279
opportunity is not there

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:57,360
but there's one other thing i also term

00:31:54,279 --> 00:32:00,799
announcement-driven development where

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:03,519
people push themselves

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,880
not to grow or to build a career but

00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,320
just to put something out there on

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,640
social media

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,640
and at the end of the day instead of

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,360
focusing on building their career

00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,360
building themselves they end up just

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,960
looking and struggling for the next

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,600
thing that they want to post on social

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,360
media

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:20,880
what do you think about this have you

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,760
experienced it or

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,559
what advice do you have on managing

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:28,720
social media

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,760
managing uh such

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,399
pressure from social media yeah yeah

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,200
that's that's a very very good question

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,240
so

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,440
so for me personally you know i've

00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,000
always had like big dreams and you know

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,679
even

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,760
when like i contributed to channels and

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,880
joining graffana labs and the company

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,880
ambassador

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,080
i knew there was more support i could

00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,039
achieve

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,200
and you know because you know because of

00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:02,320
source i've been able to

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,320
work closely with like exceptional

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,960
like principal software engineers

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,039
software architects i've been able to

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,760
work with really experienced people

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,320
and you know one thing i notice at all

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,440
times

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,799
is yes it's good to share

00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,880
my story but then it's also important to

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,960
be a mind via destination like yeah man

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,399
what your destination is basically so

00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,200
the fact that i know that i have

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,720
i still have a very long way to go i

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,000
tend not to focus

00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:37,600
on my achievements now you know

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,360
and you know right from day one i've

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,559
always i've always been

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,799
someone that is value driven so

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,600
yes the noise is quite important but

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,200
then i

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,320
focus on the end results basically so

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,159
so yeah basically i think my advice for

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,279
anyone

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,840
having such challenges is first things

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,880
first

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,159
i i think you should you know ambitious

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,360
you know have

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,480
very good ambition if you have a big

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,320
enough goal

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,520
then you know that the change you

00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,000
achieve now it's

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,040
not in compared to where you want in the

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:17,440
future and then i

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,560
think the second one is um

00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,919
is basically focus on the end result so

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,760
this thing you want to share on social

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:26,720
media what's the end result

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,440
are you sharing it just to you know make

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,440
people

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,720
know that you've arrived or are you

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,200
sharing it just to

00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,480
motivate people are you sharing it just

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:37,520
to like

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,040
inspire people basically so have

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,679
good intentions be valued again like

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,720
have a very good end result that you

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,040
want to

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,639
drive at the end of the day and then you

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,760
know last but not least

00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,599
i would say you know be authentic it

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,440
will be original it's not like

00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:02,079
sharing again it's awesome

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,880
it's also because it gets people

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,119
from there but try to be authentic you

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,640
know

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,760
try to share value

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:13,359
valid information not just because

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,400
everyone else is sharing and they just

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:18,240
want to lie about

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,800
your so try to attend and try to

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,280
you know actually be value children

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,280
that's

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,200
that's basically what i think i can say

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,640
about this

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,680
awesome and for the community don't get

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,000
me wrong it's

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,520
not wrong to celebrate your wins we

00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,760
should all

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,119
celebrate our wins and be confident in

00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,119
some of the things we achieve and

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,680
sometimes when you put yourself out

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,560
there

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,000
that is when people can know this is

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,839
what you are good at this is

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,200
what you've achieved and how they can

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,720
work with you but it's also

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,960
important to know what the goal is and

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,760
stick to the goal yeah make your

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,200
announcement

00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:01,760
share with the world but put let your id

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:03,520
or the goal and uh not uh

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:06,480
get carried away with social media

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:08,000
social media i always say social media

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,000
is the place where people put forward

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,040
their facade

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,359
what you are seeing might not

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,000
necessarily be what is true but while

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,400
we are trying to celebrate our wings

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,960
it's also very important for

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,160
us to put our eyes on the goal and make

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,280
