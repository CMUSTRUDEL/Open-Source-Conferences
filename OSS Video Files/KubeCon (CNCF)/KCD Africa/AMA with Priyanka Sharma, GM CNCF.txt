so yeah um

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:12,639
while we wait for bianca um

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:17,280
um maybe you want to introduce yourself

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,280
and probably maybe speak a little

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,039
i mean like you've been within this

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,760
place for quite some time now

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,880
um i i could remember when you know

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,800
because like i said

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,280
i'm a huge fan so i followed her stuff

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,760
didn't see twitter

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
i could remember when you used to work

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,800
you was working at winter switch and

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,719
then you tweeted about

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,559
your google summer vlogs and yeah

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,760
yeah so so i think you could probably

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,960
share basically

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,079
what you do and how

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,079
youtube has been for you

00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,199
oh okay um sardina was supposed to

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,680
like this talk but yeah

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,519
yeah it's actually yes yeah actually

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
it's basically just a chat you know just

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,680
yeah

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,240
yeah that makes sense okay so my name is

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,119
um indeed your massive wall like you

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,560
rightly said

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,520
i currently work as a developed advocate

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,320
at hashnow

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,960
which is a blogging platform for

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,680
developers who want to like get into

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,439
technical writing or sharing content to

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,799
develop our community

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,400
so above my open source journey i would

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,079
say i definitely learned about

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
like open source and like open source

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:42,159
contributions from samsung

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,880
sometime in either 2018 or 2019 i can't

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,320
remember i think it's 2018 yes so like

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
he definitely needs to talk a lot about

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,560
open source at the time and why it was

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,159
important to contribute and

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
i mean just pretty much creating

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,680
awareness around it so

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,079
i sent him a d and i was like hey can

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,399
you tell me a bit about this

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,079
so that's when he introduced me to

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,840
google summer of code at the time it was

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
nothing like google season of dorks

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
and i was still in the university at the

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,879
time so that'll be

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,319
cool let me just try out this stuff and

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,520
i try to apply for a little

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,560
somewhere i could and how will sort of

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,680
code works is

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,440
you have to con

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:23,599
first before you can apply right so

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,800
i never had any prior experiences like

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,400
contributing

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
but i need that in order for me to

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,959
submit an application i had to like make

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
that

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,680
contribution so i looked at the

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,280
different organizations to be the one

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,720
that i was interested

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,920
at the time um

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,599
and i was um doing android development

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,599
at the time right i was talking to

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,920
android development so i saw this

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,519
organization called open beta kids

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,280
and he was involved in like trying to

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
create forms for

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,879
environments that did not really have a

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,239
lot of people or

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,920
they were not really i mean like

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,040
er environments are trying to develop

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,400
pretty much and it was like an

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,360
interesting project so i decided to

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
check it out

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,560
and luckily for me that also had like

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,239
new fest um

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
projects for beginners and stuff like

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,200
that so i clicked on one of those

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,440
projects

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,040
i think thinking about it now and i'm

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,200
probably choosing another

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,879
for requests to work on but anyways i

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,480
picked up a regex

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,000
um rejects issue and yeah budget is like

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,519
actually difficult to think about

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,519
it but at the time i was like okay

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,840
i can do it it didn't really know so

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,760
difficult to like truth be told

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,200
but i ended up spending like oh my two

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,080
weeks just working on that

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
um on that solution before i finally got

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,360
got smart

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,400
but when we got met i was just excited

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,440
that

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,159
i mean like something i made or like a

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,640
feature

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,159
and change like food would be used by

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,400
the thousands of people who were already

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,439
using that platform

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,280
so exciting for me like i remember when

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,599
i got a notification from github that

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,879
your

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,879
request has been met i was like

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,280
yeah so it was so so amazing for me that

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,120
like i couldn't even believe it and

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,720
from what i read about there's already

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,280
english like thousands of people across

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
the world

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,720
so i'm like okay so someone who comes to

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,239
this app now i like try to type

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,479
something or use it

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,359
and like literally use something i

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,600
contributed to so like that excitement

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,880
exactly and and then you just keep

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
checking you know after making that

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,850
contribution you just keep checking on

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,240
your

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:35,199
[Laughter]

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,720
yeah it was like absolutely fantastic so

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,400
but anyway i didn't get accepted into

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,759
google summer of code but i was like

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,199
excited that i

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,520
was able to make my first contribution

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
and also learn how to write an

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,960
application

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,400
because that was something i've never

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,040
done and like i said i was still in

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,720
school

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,479
so yeah after i graduated from school

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,120
then i kept on

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
contributing to source i started

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,479
dabbling into more like

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,919
technical writing and like helping with

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,600
communities are like sample codes for

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,039
their apis and stuff

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,320
and i would say working on that was like

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,000
the thing got me my my former job at

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,039
inter switch right because

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
i was able to share experience of

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,240
of being able to like work on the

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
product right and this is someone who

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
didn't have prior experience

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,720
in an actual job but that was like my

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,600
first job but because i worked on a real

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,199
life project

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,880
right which is open source i was still

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,840
able to get that opportunity

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,440
so for me i would say foreign you know

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,560
literally companies don't really like

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,520
employment people that don't know

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
anything yet

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,280
i mean you can be building websites and

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,800
doing awesome stuff but want to employ

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
someone that has actually worked

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,919
in like a company or like a maybe

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,840
somewhere

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,120
right so because i was able to make

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,120
those contributions

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,880
to wikipedia i was like about to share

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,479
that experience and

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,479
um at the time the company was looking

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,759
for someone to work on their apis and

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:59,280
like improve it and stuff

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,960
so it got me that job opportunity yeah

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,400
so that's like another interesting thing

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,960
about open source

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,720
then um yeah i got accepted into

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
google season of docs which is more

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
focused on like bringing

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,840
technical writers and opponents

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,400
organizations

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,440
um to like improve it and then work for

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,240
three months and

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,280
google like pu for making those

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,759
contributions

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,000
yes i think open source has definitely

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,240
helped my career and diversity

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,280
from like giving me access to meet

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,680
amazing people

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,800
to making my first contribution in a

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,520
real life project

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,440
to um put more opportunities for like

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,360
job roles and tons of that stuff

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,400
so i think it's it's like ecosystems

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,880
participating

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,160
i think um contributing is absolutely

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,919
important so

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,759
if you've not contributed yet i think

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:54,880
you should definitely give it a try

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,919
yeah yeah exactly like like i

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,599
totally relate to the story i mean i i

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,440
think you know the most important part

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,120
was basically where you mentioned

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,960
that if companies basically it's very

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,759
hard for companies to hire

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,680
anyone that has disabled experience and

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,919
i

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
that's what it gives you a starting

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,880
point you know like

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,800
when i was in belgium and graffana and

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:21,840
crawford labs and

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,960
i was lit i was i was expected to

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,319
have a presentation basically and i i

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
was thinking of what

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,440
projects am i going to present now this

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
is the

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,479
the small html and css sites i built

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,840
you know like two years ago you know

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,680
something like that you know so

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
i would i needed to present something

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,840
that could actually

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,440
interest them and you know make them you

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,360
know

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,199
actually be excited so and of course uh

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,039
i've done some open source contributions

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
to channels and

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,560
i was like yes this is this is the

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,960
project so

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,759
i took i took some time to work on my

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,400
slides

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
i made sure that i pointed the values i

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,000
was like

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
giving out time yeah because because

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,919
it's open source and because

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,639
it has you know users behind those

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,319
projects

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,319
it was easier for me to call kids

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,759
yes i built this and then i know that

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,240
it's actually helping out

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,919
these results you know so so yeah i

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,840
think that's like one of the

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,840
best parts of contributing

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,839
yeah thanks a lot for actually sharing

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,040
that

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,360
uh and i'm sorry i'm

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,839
actually digesting it a little bit but i

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,880
want to i want to maybe

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,760
touch more on the oscar event so

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,120
i don't know if you attended my talk but

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,760
basically i

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
made a huge reference to the oscar now

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,920
first of all

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,320
so yeah i was at the festival then of

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,959
course

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
uh you know i came with my friends from

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,080
know

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,440
and you know i was really really

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,680
interested in

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,640
everything that was happening and so my

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,000
greatest surprise

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,200
i was wowed by you know the experiences

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,279
like

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:27,440
because i saw and i think the best

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,440
any real prospect is anyway

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,920
i owe you two bottles of beer like that

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
guy is just

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,680
so good like you know i think the best

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,560
part for me at the conference was

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,560
when you know the presentation

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,320
yeah that was amazing yeah i was i mean

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,800
like

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,080
i was just i think that was basically

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,080
the turning point for me you know

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,399
i mean it's amazing at some point

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
even up till now once once i just hope i

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,079
can just you know watch it to get

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,320
inspired and connected so

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,920
so yeah um maybe you could just touch a

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,600
little bit on

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,000
oscar because i know you are also part

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,079
of the oscar um

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,480
the open source community africa we

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,399
could talk a little bit about oscar and

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,680
how people can get involved with oscar

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,640
how you can join

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,640
the oscar community

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,160
yeah sure um so like the oscars created

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,920
pretty much

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,000
to try to expose more

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,040
um africans like open source like i

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,480
mentioned i

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
literally didn't know any single thing

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,079
about it until i hooked up with

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
something

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,240
but like i think facebook at the time to

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,800
like see his

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
um posts now and about it so there are

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,920
still

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,200
thousands of africans right i still

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,120
don't know anything about

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
open source contributions open source in

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,399
general and there are so many

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
opportunities i can get from this thing

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,399
right

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,959
so the fact that people don't know it

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,399
would limit them from that opportunity

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,880
so the essence behind oscar is to

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,560
try to sensitize more people about open

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,040
source right let them know that hey this

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,399
stuff exists you could you must not

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,320
necessarily be

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,760
a contributor it could also be a builder

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,600
it could be like a maintainer you could

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,320
be the one who built the open source

00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,480
project

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,000
right so trying to create more people

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,120
who are like comfortable with sharing

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
their source code

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,920
i feel like africa is a place where

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
everybody's like hey you have to do this

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,279
on your own you have to be like the best

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,079
it was a share and stuff like that

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:38,560
so try to create that like experience or

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,000
that environment where people feel

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,640
very comfortable like me being open with

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,800
like your code based documentation like

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,560
just trying to create that experience of

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,880
people and

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,200
we i mean at the time we tried to work

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,040
on like oscar first we thought of how do

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,440
we make it more

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,040
like something that maybe when you come

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,800
like you said it like you rightly said

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,079
you were inspired to go back to make an

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,880
open source contribution because of

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,760
first pastor

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,399
right so we have come up with like

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,639
really

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,720
um awesome keynote speakers and then

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:14,079
looking like a cfp where we got

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,079
um people into the the program

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,440
as well so it definitely took a lot a

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,279
lot of planning

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,959
i think we started planning like months

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,680
before it happened because we also have

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,200
to like

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,959
create a way for people to read this

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,480
star i mean because if you finish doing

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
everything nobody comes for the event

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,519
it's almost like oh okay

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,720
nothing happened right so yeah we have

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,760
secrets like

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,519
a lot of awareness for the event and i'm

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
trying to bring like a lot of companies

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,160
from

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,200
the u.s involved so i feel like

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,959
everybody knows that

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
africa is like the next best thing there

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,360
are so many talented people in africa

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,839
so every company wants to get involved

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,079
with the ecosystem and see how

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
um they can like impact it and we try to

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,160
do stuff to make it better

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,079
right so we try to get all those

00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,040
companies involved as well

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,680
and to see what we could do pretty much

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,160
and

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,320
i mean i think in in summary i would say

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,560
it it actually turned out turned out

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,240
really great we've definitely seen

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,600
a lot more africans at prices like

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,360
google somewhere of course google

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,519
seasonal doors outreachy

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,760
like i think last last the number of

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,760
africans we had last year

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,959
in google some tribal seasoning of those

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,279
that are twitchy

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,720
was like never seen before the number

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,600
four that got accepted

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
right usually you won nigerian or maybe

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
one

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,399
um song from cameroon but now you had

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,240
like over like five to ten people who

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,959
were like accepted and these are like

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,880
impacts from that event in fact from

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,240
sharing and like let people know that

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
you could have access to so many

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,839
opportunities from contributing to open

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,279
source or

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,880
hosting or like building your own open

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,800
source project in general so i think i

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,279
think it was cool

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,040
yeah yeah i mean i couldn't agree more

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,519
honestly

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,240
because i mean like that event was my

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,000

achieved a lot in your career i mean

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,240
even reaching the point where

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,360
you're not the general manager for cncf

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
that's like

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,720
a very big deal so can you talk a bit

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,520
about your

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,360
tech journey how you got into tech and

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,720
the experience so far

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:20,079
and what you're currently doing now sure

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:22,160
happy too so tech journey you know so

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,120
i've always worked in technology

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,480
i uh i was born and brought up in india

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,200
and i came to

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,679
stanford university in the us for

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,559
undergrad i came on a scholarship

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,799
at that time i was not familiar at all

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,120
with the more technical subjects etc i

00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,520
mean in high school i had taken sciences

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,600
and

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,520
computer science but when i came to

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,240
college i got involved with

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,000
um this freshman year program called

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,520
structured liberal education

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
where they taught you the history of

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,720
human thought from the past

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,039
like since the beginning of uh literate

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,840
time

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,520
so i learned a lot about uh buddhism i

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,240
learned a lot about hinduism a lot about

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,440
like plato

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,320
aristotle uh all the modern uh

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
philosophers

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,720
and that was a completely different

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,720
world than technology

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,360
right yeah and then uh you know when i

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
graduated though like

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,280
i was um i applied everywhere as all and

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,720
undergraduate students

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,559
should so if there's anyone listening

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,760
that's my advice

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,440
apply everywhere um and the job that was

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
the best one that worked out for me was

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,679
at google

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,840
and uh i accepted the role

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,799
and i started working there i was in

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,080
partnerships

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,480
at adsense but you know from that first

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,400
year

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,720
it very quickly became apparent that the

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,799
type of work that i gravitated towards

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,240
was always with engineers with product

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,880
managers and

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,280
i helped launch some internal products

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,280
and

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,000
i actually got an offer to join the eng

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,280
team uh with the goal to like go down

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,120
the product path

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,480
uh at that time i had a lot of um

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,400
what would you say like startup

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,000
ambitions and so

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,080
instead of that i ended up joining a

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,039
startup which uh

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:09,520
got acquired pretty soon but i learned a

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,559
lot about how small teams scrappy teams

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,360
operate

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,960
um then i met my but at this point you

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,240
you have to know like i was in tech but

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,799
i wasn't working

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,919
on developer tools or anything like that

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,440
then i

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:25,120
actually ended up working on a startup

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,120
of my own and there one

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,360
yeah thank you uh well it didn't feel so

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,360
amazing back there it was really intense

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,039
but one of the things that we uh

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,080
developed the one that was most

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,679
successful was like

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,160
time tracking applications for

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,840
developers and that's when i really

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,080
started working you know

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,840
with open source communities because we

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,360
wanted to popularize our product and

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,679
like you know other people

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,400
i encourage other people to contribute

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,200
and there was an immediate click um

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,160
and so i that then slowly i ended up

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,520
working at

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,000
a company called light step i was the

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,520
first business hire and that's where

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,039
i actually became an open source

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,840
contributor to

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,600
a project called open tracing and it's

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,360
at light step that i learned everything

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,440
about distributed systems

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,600
how micro services work what are

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,039
containers what are the problems

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,159
in this space um and open tracing

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,960
was uh a spec for

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,600
basically how to instrument your system

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,799
to

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:29,600
get tracing data out of it since then uh

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:31,679
open telemetry has risen and uh uh

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:34,000
that's the new version and it's in cncf

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,679
as well just like open tracing was it

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
was through open tracing that i got to

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,480
know

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,120
cncf we were the third project to join

00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,360
and from the

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,880
very beginning the community just

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,559
welcomed me it's been an

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,559
exceptionally welcoming community and um

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,400
i just did everything i could to promote

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,280
our project and got involved in lots of

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,360
things

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,400
uh built a lot of relationships and

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,679
friendships

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,360
uh then i went to work at git lab where

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,120
i had actually known the founder since

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,360
my own startup days

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,799
and i built the developer evangelism

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,440
team there that's where i had the honor

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,520
of working with abu bakr

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,080
and then that's where i actually got

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,440
elected to serve on the cncf board

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,320
and that was a really eye-opening

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,840
experience because the community is wide

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,400
and massive and so

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,480
warm but the board is where you see okay

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,679
all the real work that goes into

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,080
but into like nurturing this world

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,159
uh and then eventually jim zemlin who

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,000
leads linux foundation

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,159
he tapped me on the shoulder and said

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,480
hey you should come run this foundation

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,799
at first i was like oh you're kidding

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,799
but

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,600
then we had some real conversations and

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,000
i'd already like worked so much with dan

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
khan

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,039
and chris and his check and had such

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
deep respect for them

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,559
uh when the opportunity presented itself

00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,039
i was really honored

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,039
uh i accepted the job by the way i

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,760
accepted the job pre-pandemic

00:21:55,039 --> 00:22:03,120
oh and post so a lot has changed

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,000
yeah a lot has definitely changed

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,679
uh here i am that's kind of my journey

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,760
toby wasn't too boring

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,799
no it wasn't it's absolutely fantastic

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,880
and i love that

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,320
like i mean you it wasn't just hey you

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,960
just woke up and you became like

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:19,440
cmcf um general manager you had to

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,320
follow different processes right for you

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,120
absolutely you were like good enough for

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,960
that position

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,159
so that's a really interesting journey i

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,400
think also speaks to

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,440
the fact that nothing just happens

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,559
immediately it takes

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,039
it takes in work and like um being open

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,880
to

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,400
connecting with people right just like

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,919
how someone met you and said hey i think

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,200
you should run this foundation

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,520
and the reason why that happened because

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,200
you were like open to like connecting

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,559
like sharing the knowledge you had so

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,640
people knew that you were good enough

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,720
for that opportunity

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,960
well you are right if the power of

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,640
people should never be missing

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,840
um should never be how do you say it

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,240
sorry it's already very like what is

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,240
that yeah

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,520
yeah exactly exactly because you know

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,240
even in our

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,280
actually especially in our world of

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,240
technology and

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,919
infrastructure and open source it's the

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,960
relationships that matter

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,360
and the beauty of our community is that

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,240
the relationships are more open like you

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,720
can approach

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,679
anyone you can have that conversation i

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,840
think in the more

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,760
like traditional environments it's not

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,080
the case because there's so many

00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:33,039
barriers to get to the people who make

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,039
decisions

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,159
that's not the case here so people

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:39,280
should really

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,799
value that and reach out make friends

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,679
help people out because they will help

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,279
them in the future yeah i totally agree

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
to that plus plus one

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,840
there is this school platform that plays

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,679
um

00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:52,480
um like soundtracks just get a second to

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,240
find it

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,600
because what you just said deserves a

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,600
cup yeah so let me just do it

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:06,320
okay at the cup yeah i did do it again

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,320
let me try again

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,520
did you do your hairs no no

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:19,840
sorry headphones on

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,840
but yeah

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,240
really laughing about it all right cool

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,600
thank you so much for answering that

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,039
question definitely gave a lot of

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,159
insights to

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,279
your journey so um looking at the cncf

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,120
landscape it's

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,640
quite i mean some would say it's quite

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,400
overwhelming so

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,480
you suggested like a good path for

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:43,200
someone to follow if they're interested

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,840
in the cloud native like community or

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,400
wanting more involved in the cloud

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,120
ecosystem

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,799
absolutely i think the cncf landscape is

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,760
exactly that a landscape so it's

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,880
supposed to show you

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,600
everything right and that's why it's so

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,600
busy

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,279
but what you will see in the landscape

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
is that there are categories right like

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,720
there is um

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,640
csd i think and then there's like

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,039
security there's platforms

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
all kinds of stuff so i see the

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,320
landscape as useful

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
one as a first glance for people to

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,600
understand like oh

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,480
there is a lot going on here that's

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,880
great yeah second it's useful when you

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,880
know

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
what you're looking for so if you're

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,080
looking for a

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,840
security solution if you're looking for

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,520
some server-less insights

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,840
then it's super useful but middle ground

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,880
between knowing this is a vast ecosystem

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,640
and um you know

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,120
and knowing exactly where to look is the

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,400
more where to start question

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:44,240
for that i would recommend that people

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,919
actually um actually my opinion is that

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
the kubecon cloud native cons are the

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:51,279
best way to get started

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,400
so these are chip events they happen

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,159
um three times a year once in

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,159
well in the real world it used to always

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:01,200
be u.s

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,240
and than um asia pack

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,159
and now of course everything is virtual

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,720
but that's a good thing because anybody

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,159
can join without the hassle of travel

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,679
so native con uh you is actually

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,840
happening next week

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,039
and i encourage anyone and everyone to

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,640
attend

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,480
um if you um if you're a student you can

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,840
reach out and get a student code

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
so happy to help with that um just so

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,720
you know like

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,799
because of this need for beginner

00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,240
content beginner understanding

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,240
we have a 101 track we also have started

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,919
a business value track this time

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,720
subtract which is just like three four

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,159
talks

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,080
for people who like literally like

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,480
definitions in cloud native

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,279
how to uh sell open course to your boss

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,520
those kinds of

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:48,960
like you know really fundamental things

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,400
um so

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,240
every time there's something new at

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,320
kubecons and also you meet a ton of

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,320
people you play games you have fun

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,559
i'm doing happy hours people jump all

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,640
the time so that's a good way to get

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,559
like an intro into the community

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,799
i think events that we have restarted

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,520
like kcd kcd africa which is happening

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,640
right now are

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,039
also a great option um so

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,480
i would say go to where the people are

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,159
to get started

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,600
once you have built a little bit of

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,640
knowledge uh

00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,120
then you start going into the landscape

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,600
to pick

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,520
specific technologies that you may need

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,600
uh i would actually say there is

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,440
an edx course on kubernetes fundamentals

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,640
that might be a really good one to look

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,840
at too

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,919
all right also i'm pretty sure you don't

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,880
mind can you share like the link here

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:41,440
like in the chat so that we could send

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,399
so they could easily access it yes

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,360
i'm looking right now also it's good to

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,960
know that the

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,760
um csaf is creating beginner-friendly

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,440
content

00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,120
and making it much more welcoming for

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,960
people who want to join

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:56,720
um the foundation and the ecosystem so

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,159
that's that's fantastic to hear thanks

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,880
for sharing

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,720
absolutely yeah there's this popular

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,760
myth that federer will talk about they

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,799
believe that

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,960
um open source contributions is only for

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,159
software engineers do you believe that's

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,080
true um

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,240
based on your answer what are your

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,799
thoughts on this on this myth

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,159
sorry sorry uh you said people's people

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,960
say that open source

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,080
is only for engineers what yeah yeah

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,000
like people believe that

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,200
if suffering from medicine i'll be like

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,279
no i don't i can't

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,880
where would i possibly find like

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,240
anything design related to doing the

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,080
open source ecosystem

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,840
so can you speak a bit more to the

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,320
opportunities that other people can

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,440
assess

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,159
regardless of being software engineer

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,480
absolutely i mean think about this today

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,720
we are the fastest growing

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,240
community in open source why is that

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,279
happening because

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,080
so many for-profit companies have built

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:53,600
products and offerings based on our open

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,440
source projects

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:59,039
and so the need for all types of

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,720
professionals whether it's a designer

00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,679
whether it's a tech docs writer whether

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,360
it's a marketer

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,480
events producer everything is like

00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,840
so needed right so first is that in the

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,159
ecosystem that's created by cloud native

00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,399
technologies

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,279
there are companies and just like any

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,039
company they need

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,120
all kinds of skill sets and you should

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,159
totally apply because it's a hot

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,919
industry

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,279
the second piece is the open source

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,640
projects directly

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,279
when you think of the open source

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,480
projects i agree that there's been this

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:34,159
myth or i would say

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,159
just assumption that

00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,080
that open source is for and by

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,799
developers

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,840
that's absolutely how it started yes

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,880
because they are

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,720
contributing code but the reality is

00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,080
now open source much more sophisticated

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,799
it's used it's so much more

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,760
mainstream we need documentation for

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,919
those projects

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,000
we need websites for those projects so

00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,039
we need design work so there's

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,880
um and then we need to like cncf is full

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,520
of staff that works on

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,799
uh you know doing events doing marketing

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,840
doing all of that

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,960
for open source projects so for each and

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,399
every one of you

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,039
there is a place in the open source

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,760
community

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,880
definitely the cloud native community so

00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,080
definitely consider

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,840
joining us thank you i think

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,600
the last thing you said is like should

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,039
be the highlight of this event there is

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,480
like space for

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:30,399
everyone in the cncf

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,640
like whatever it is you're doing a

00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,520
technical writer i could contribute to

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,919
the website or the documentation are

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,159
your desire to contribute to the designs

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,360
make make it more accessible or more

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:42,960
user friendly

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,399
whatever it is you're doing this like

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,840
something you could actually contribute

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,760
to

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,880
absolutely and i wanted to mention one

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,320
thing which is

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,000
mentorships something the cncf like pays

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
a lot of attention to

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,559
is you know again uplifting as many

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,880
people as we can and helping them

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,000
so one of the things we do is called lfx

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,200
mentorships

00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,080
which is that in the summer people

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,519
well in the northern hemisphere summer

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,559
people can apply

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,279
to to do um

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,240
and a mentorship with our open source

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,640
projects

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,880
and they actually type in for it and

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,120
they're paired with the projects to then

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,720
uh work on different things you would

00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,320
assume that it's all about

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:30,000
just um again coding right but no like i

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,080
heard of someone who's actually i just

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,960
saw a video yesterday of this lady

oh something so sharing we're going to

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,039

00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,399
could easily access it

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,519
oh cool oh so there is this um i

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,120
remember this i was having a

00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,159
conversation with like a group of

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,320
people in the ecosystem and i think it

00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,760
was about how g

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,080
gets like get opportunities right and

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,840
someone mentioned that contributing to

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,720
open source can be one of those ways you

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,240
could level up

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
so that when you apply for a job you

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,880
could see that you have some level of

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,279
experience working

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,120
with a real life project right but then

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,799
some people they agree with this they're

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,720
like no you can't say

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,880
contributes open source can help in any

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,919
way so what are your thoughts on that do

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,679
you think

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,200
contributing to process can level up

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,240
someone's career

00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:35,120
or not absolutely my whole career is

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,320
built on open source

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,640
exactly yes um i would say you know the

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,440
big

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,279
reason that is the case especially now

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,799
is not only are you building your skills

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,600
when you're contributing

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,519
but also as i mentioned like especially

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,640
in the cloud native ecosystem a lot of

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,480
innovation

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,480
that for-profit companies are doing is

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,399
based upon open course software

00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,519
and so there is so many opportunities to

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,440
be part of something that is uh

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,440
going to be valuable to a company that

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,240
you're naturally improving your career

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,480
chances

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,679
i think because of that it's also become

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,520
like

00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,440
maybe it's become a little intimidating

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,960
to join projects in let's say cncf

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,839
because it's like all these experts are

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,320
part of it

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,280
now yeah and because you know like

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,599
companies are

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,720
campaigning people to be 100 working on

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,440
open source

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,720
and so in that world i think it's really

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,520
important to like you know do the

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,159
mentorship

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,919
attend the event develop your knowledge

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,679
and uh then just start

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,359
uh there's especially for kubernetes

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,720
which is our flagship project

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,960
we have um this like you know

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,960
contributor experience and like they try

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,079
to offer new contributors so you have a

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,159
lot of help

00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,399
you should absolutely go and do it

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,320
because you will be noticed by all these

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,320
people who are in the community

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,159
they all work places they're always

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,040
hiring they'll reach out to you you can

00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,079
even ask them that hey i'm looking

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:02,079
exactly so it's the way to go for sure

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,920
it's the new version of networking you

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,920
know how networking used to be the thing

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,200
yeah because yeah

00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,359
because when you when you think it's

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,119
very contributes open source projects

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,480
chances are that project or the

00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,320
organization they are like

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,520
people from different places all over

00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,160
the world there right

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,560
so by contributing you're already making

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,560
like

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:24,240
um yourself known to those people right

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:25,839
so you're already building relationships

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,160
and those will might help you get like

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:29,760
your next job or maybe help you review

00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,119
your article they're like so many

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,599
opportunities so many things you could

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,720
assess

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,119
from just contributing to such

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,640
open source organizations so yeah i'm

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,280
definitely on the side that

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,640
open source can help you level up your

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,800
career

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,960
absolutely it's like a must do

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,839
especially in this industry

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,440
i agree i agree so what would you say i

00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,720
like some of the skills required to

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,200
scale like cloud

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,560
native ecosystem or like cloud in

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,640
general

00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,880
uh what are the skills that are required

00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,280
to to scale like if

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,119
someone wanted to you start doing

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,599
something like what i think you need to

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,680
know

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,640
in order to do let's say a perfect first

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:10,560
job or

00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,640
you also do things on that scale like

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,160
yeah and the ecosystem okay

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,320
okay got it because when you said scale

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,359
i was like because you know scale had so

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,200
much technical meaning and like yeah

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,560
like oh how did they scale their

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,560
production system

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,240
yeah that's not like it's very broad so

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,960
it could mean anything yeah so it makes

00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:30,079
sense but it's

00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,240
clarifying no no no worries so

00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,920
okay so what are the things people might

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,440
need for their first job

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
i would say every first job's different

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,880
uh

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,400
if we are talking about the what in

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
general i think what's only going to

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,160
help

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,040
is be familiar with the

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,400
definitions in cloud native and be

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,200
familiar with

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,920
um you know the key projects maybe look

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,200
at all the graduated projects in cncf

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,119
actually you can actually use the

00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,160
landscape for this thing you can

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,000
filter to look at your projects let me

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,320
drop the link to that here

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,760
that's a good idea yeah um so be

00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,200
familiar with these things

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,240
and then um being i think being an

00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,640
active participant

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,480
in the community and looking at like the

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,119
technical problems that are interesting

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,280
to you

00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:21,280
is a really good head start because then

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,040
you'll seek out jobs like that

00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,400
and when you get into that job you'll

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,440
know more and you'll be

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,079
uh able to be successful very quickly

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,880
yeah that that's that's that's fantastic

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,119
to be honest

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,160
it's actually great all right cool so we

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,079
have like um

00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,720
some organizations like for instance

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,200
chicorafica which recently started like

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,520
a

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:43,440
place where try to bring in more women

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,400
into like the cloud ecosystem

00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,320
right so do they do the cncf have

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,960
something like that something focused on

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,880
like

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,040
maybe women trying to promote more women

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,280
to join the organization

00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,200
um or maybe learn more about trying to

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,400
make it more inclusive or diverse for

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,040
people

00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,520
absolutely so actually the mentorships i

00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,640
mentioned we try our level best to

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,800
you know it's like um like a diversity

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,960
uh scholar it's like diversity is a

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,440
number one criteria and how we

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,400
like people and that's gender

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,440
demographic

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,079
that's all kinds of things right um

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,480
that's a factor uh besides that what we

00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,480
do

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,000
in our flagship kubecon cloud native

00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,200
cons is we ensure

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,720
that we um

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,400
how do i say it um we have like as many

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,320
like female speakers as possible in

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,200
their keynote ages we tend to like do

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,079
better

00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,280
than the regular talks uh but we're

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,040
working on it

00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,200
but i think like the number one is our

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:46,480
like and we also provide scholarships to

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,720
kubecon events especially in person

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,680
yeah and they are diversity and need

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,920
base so

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,680
those are all some things happening in

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,680
general you know i think

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,000
there's many places that you'll hear of

00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:59,440
programs and this and we of course we

00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,599
have those

00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,280
but it is my personal view that it's

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,880
like you know you have to be committed

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,200
to diversity

00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,599
and do something every day like it's a

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,400
bit by bit like you move the mountain

00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,079
and that means that person you talk to

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,880
every time you come across someone who

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,160
may be

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,560
uh talented and interested

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,280
in our space then it's about going up

00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,280
our way

00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,440
to make sure we share opportunities with

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,160
them we offer ourselves as mentors we

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,000
offer

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,440
ourselves like hey reach out to me if

00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,480
you're ever looking for a job i'll try

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,119
to help you

00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,640
and that thing me at least the cncf

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,680
staff

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,359
do like every day of our lives so

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,280
and like we keep an open door so for

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,640
example my twitter dms are open

00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:47,280
anyone can reach out please feel free

00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,040
the cnc of slack anyone can join that

00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,160
and learn and like reach out ask

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:56,160
questions so there is this open door

00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,880
policy that there is this open door

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,480
policy

00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,480
that helps us help anyone who needs

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,640
something and we have a big focus on

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,319
diversity and inclusion

00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,960
and that's through our programs and

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,720
through our one-on-one efforts

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,319
that's not it's it's really good to know

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,319
that there's something you said about

00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,400
being intentional about doing this it's

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,480
not just um something you just do

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:19,839
wanna initiate your like boom with fixed

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,480
diversity it's like

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:22,880
doing it consistently yeah because it's

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
not

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,079
it's not something that is going to

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,319
happen overnight right it's something

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,920
that has to be done consistently and

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,839
with patients to make it a lot more

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,359
inclusive for people

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,119
but it's really good to hear that the

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
organization is

00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:38,720
working in that direction and trying to

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,839
make inclusivity and

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,480
um make it okay and better for everybody

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:44,400
to feel

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,680
involved i feel like part of the

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
community

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,760
yeah and we also like try to set the

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,640
example with the staff

00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,160
demographics like we are very diverse we

00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,640
are there's so many women there's so

00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,079
many different countries represented

00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,760
i have uh team members from ukraine from

00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,920
uh berlin so germany uh us

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,760
all kinds of there's someone in bali

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,000
there's like oh

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,000
you know

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,480
there's um there's also just you know

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:18,000
in our a lot of our efforts like the

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,800
center around

00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,359
mentorships uh scholarships to kubecon

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,000
and also

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,319
the programming at kubecon so you'll see

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,200
in kubecons that there are specific

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:31,280
specific deni initiatives like there's

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,880
mentorship sessions there is like

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,880
networking career help

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
learning from each other so there's a

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,640
lot over there that happens to encourage

00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,000
anyone and everyone to make progress

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,800
yeah that's absolutely fun it's very

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,119
good to hear

00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,040
to hear that to be honest so what would

00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,319
you say is like the next steps for a

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,599
cncf right

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,040
you guys are already doing amazing

00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:56,720
things what are like what are we looking

00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,560
to do in the future for

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,200
the community in general and trying to

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,839
make the foundation a lot more better

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,440
yeah i mean that is actually the main

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,800
thing that i think about all the time is

00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,040
like how are we

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,119
you know actually keeping pace with our

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,160
very vibrant community that keeps on

00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,640
yeah um

00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,800
uh so some of the programs that are fun

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,040
like well one is this kcds you folks are

00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,119
one of our flagship ones for kcd you did

00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,000
a great job organizing

00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,440
um and we have now have kcds can be

00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,119
virtual so they're ones like

00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:30,480
we have one in every continent except

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,079
for antarctica

00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,480
and so good um

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,400
and soon they'll be back in person the

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,160
other is there's a launch happening soon

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,520
of cloud native tv

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,720
which is our friend yeah it's our twitch

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,040
tv channel

00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,720
so you can just go to cloudnative.tv and

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:50,720
you'll go to the twitch page

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,400
and june 7th is when they're going to

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,960
launch and have like

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,400
shows and it's going to be that's

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,319
actually also going to be a really good

00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,599
amount of beginner content there's a lot

00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,520
of like 100

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,079
yeah uh projects 101

00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:08,560
lots of stuff there's also a show around

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,960
specifically looking at de ni

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,680
contributors whether they're women of

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,760
color

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,760
and how they are how they have been

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,359
successful so that's coming and our hope

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,880
there is to encourage and excite a

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:21,200
broader audience

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,319
um so there are lots of programs a

00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,960
sister event

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,800
a sister effort that we have launched is

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,480
inclusive naming initiative

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,079
and that is something that i've been

00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,200
working on which is

00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,880
um based on the kubernetes project's

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,160
efforts to remove

00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,920
uh racially problematic language

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,319
from software yeah so we want to remove

00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,359
master slave we want to remove whitelist

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,599
blacklist

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,359
because such things should have no place

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,640
in our code bases

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,400
and ini actually that's what we call it

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,800
has gotten a lot of attention we

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,359
actually got a new york times article

00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,359
recently

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,960
and it's all based on the work we did at

00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:05,359
the in the kubernetes project to do this

00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,000
yeah

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,160
and lots of companies are participating

00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,359
if anyone here has is working at a

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,480
company that would like to

00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:16,720
make their code base you know not

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,760
not be richly problematic terminology

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,359
yeah

00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,119
they should consider looking at it i'm

00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,480
gonna find the

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:28,880
article and um

00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:32,880
share with you um sure

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:36,319
but yeah so it's like lots of uh

00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,680
good stuff is happening um and

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:42,079
i also one more thing though we in the

00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,720
staff we can think of certain number of

00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,839
ideas we can think of certain number of

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,760
uh plans but really the community is

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:52,800
what we want to leverage

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,640
so if anyone has a good idea

00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,480
that they want to share of like hey this

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,800
can be useful to people

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,240
definitely bring it up and we will work

00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,599
with you to see if it's like you know

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,560
doable and if it is

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,079
definitely do it so what channels can

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,839
you bring up these ideas is they like

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,240
choose a slack channel or do you have

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:12,160
like a dedicated place where

00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,520
about the communities can like share

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,920
ideas or

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,119
feature requests or something that's

00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,800
actually a really good idea

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:22,800
we don't have like pretty sure yeah

00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,960
you work on that because we right now

00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,440
it's like ad hoc like send me a dms

00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,119
and someone a slack message uh yeah so

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,520
that is right now

00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:32,240
but i think actually we should build out

00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,079
like

00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,920
any suggestions for us kind of thing so

00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,760
yeah it will be a lot more easier to

00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,480
manage because everything just

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,400
celebrates

00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,680
different people it might get lost in

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,119
there but they have a place where

00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,040
everybody knows that this is where you

00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,640
can like drop suggestion

00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,240
and if you people pick up any other

00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,839
source you can just like see here we're

00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,440
currently working on this or something

00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,200
they need to be great

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,200
that's a really good idea will do

00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:02,880
all right all right thank you so so much

00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,160
for answering all the questions you

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,599
definitely give me a lot of insights

00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,079
about

00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,119
cf in general open source contributions

on your journey

00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,160
i definitely learned a lot and i believe

00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,040
that people who

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,880
participated in this as well so thank
