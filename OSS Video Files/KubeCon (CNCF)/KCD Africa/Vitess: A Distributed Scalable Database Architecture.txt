	Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL through sharding. By enabling shard-routing logic, Vitess allows application code and database queries to remain agnostic to data distribution onto multiple shards. With Vitess, you can split, merge, and migrate shards as your needs grow.
