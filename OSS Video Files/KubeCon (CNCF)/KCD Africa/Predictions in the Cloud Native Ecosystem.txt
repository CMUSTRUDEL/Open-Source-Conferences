00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,960
and he will be talking on the topic

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
predictions in the cloud native

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
ecosystem

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,600

all today i'm excited that

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,159
uh our kubernetes community day

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,200
uh community days program is coming back

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,960
to life

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,560
um after you know quite the hiatus

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,200
given given everything we've been going

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,240
through uh as a world in in this

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
pandemic

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,640
um i'm excited that the first uh

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,560
community back uh is in africa um

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,159
i like the previous speaker i wish i

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,320
could be there with you

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,200
um i'd love to come visit i've only ever

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
been

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
uh to africa once me and my team got to

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,720
go to

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
cape town so kind of all the way in the

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,840
south

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,439
um i flew over the whole continent from

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,040
from london on the way but i'd love to

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,280
to visit more

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
um i think everybody's kind of feeling

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
that

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,159
like i used to travel a good amount for

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,880
work um

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,159
and uh i think like as the pandemic

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,280
hopefully

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,759
um you know ends uh and hopefully we we

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,599
get

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,440
uh it under control i feel like

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,920
everyone's got the travel bug to try and

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,720
and and go and see parts of the world

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
that you know

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
we we took travel for granted maybe in

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,440
lots of ways before so

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,440
excited for that uh again my name is

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,879
is brennan o'leary i'm i'm really

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,000
excited to be here

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,280
uh i work uh at get lab actually with

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,560
abu bakar who's

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,720
one of the organizers of the event um

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,920
and he asked me to come uh speak to you

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
today about

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,440
predictions uh in the cloud native

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,920
ecosystem so

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,200
that's probably the hardest thing to

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,040
come and speak about but

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,840
i'm i'm honored that he thought you know

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,080
i would have something to add to that

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,959
conversation

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
and hopefully hopefully i do hopefully

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
you learned something today

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,319
um also really interested in any

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,319
questions you have for me

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,000
i'm in addition to working at git lab

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,640
i'm actually a member of the governing

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,760
board

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,959
of the cncf i've been a member

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,680
for probably just about a year at this

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,680
point

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,080
um and so i'm really interested in

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,120
questions you might have for me

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,599
um and about either

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
you know git lab of course or the cncf

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,120
itself

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,599
um questions and thoughts you might have

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,440
um

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,440
thoughts about today's event all all of

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,720
those things are wide open

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,959
um to talk about but um first today i

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,000
kind of want to go through

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
um kind of my thoughts and and kind of a

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,840
level set

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,519
of how i think we got to where we are uh

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,920
of course some of this might not be news

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
for

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,080
for folks joining um this event who have

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
you know

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,000
been following the cloud native

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,439
community or or following

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
um you know kubernetes for a long time

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,040
but i want to give some context because

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
i think that before you can

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,480
try and predict the future which of

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,280
course no one can uh you have to have

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,799
the context of

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,720
of how we got to where we are so i want

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
to talk about that a little bit

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
uh then i'm going to talk about some

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,319
specific

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,280
things in the cloud native technology

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,320
space that i think are going to be

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,880
important in the coming years

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,000
and and that's reflective of kind of my

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,320
view on

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,280
on watching the industry as well as you

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
know what other

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,360
industry leaders have been talking about

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,520
in cloud native

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,960
uh including the head of the the

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,320
technical oversight committee liz rice

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,600
so i have to give credit to her for some

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,520
of these ideas

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,160
um because she has a finger on the pulse

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,280
of of of everything of course

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,680
and then i'll talk a little bit about

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,919
industry trends in in general

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
like things outside of maybe cloud

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,320
native but that are

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,320
either tangentially or or related in the

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,840
sense that you know it's in the software

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,600
industry and and

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,680
trends that are happening uh

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,440
in enterprise software and and software

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
in general

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,400
and then and then we'll talk about

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,840
what's next like how if these are the

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
predictions for now

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520
you know how can you possibly keep up

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
with uh

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,840
with where we're going so that's kind of

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,840
what we're going to cover today

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,240
all right and um so first

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,520
you know how how did we get here right

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,560
well you know by way of a

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,240
kind of a brief intro you know really

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
the landscape of software development is

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,080
changing and

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,160
it's in some ways always changing but i

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,560
think that um

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,160
the advent of the cloud and the growing

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,680
popularity of it

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,199
uh the advent of cloud native

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
technologies

00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,240
have accelerated it and i think that's

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
that in itself isn't something that's

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,680
very new um

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,440
again it's always changing if we look at

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
like kind of what

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,120
modernization and software has looked

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,240
like

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,440
we've seen these kind of trends that

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:02,800
come and accelerate growth

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,280
in software so you know

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
10 or 12 years ago at this point there's

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,319
a famous

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,759
venture capitalist who said marc

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
andreessen he said that

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,800
software is eating the world and i think

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,120
that that

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,479
was very true then and is true now i

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,120
think software

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,000
has eaten the world right we've seen

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
that software

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
is the way that companies now

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
differentiate themselves from one

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,160
another

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,360
it's uh every company

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,160
is a software company whether they make

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,080
software

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
you know as their primary product or

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,280
they sell something else

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,840
um you know every company needs uh

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,720
software and and and to be able to move

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,120
quickly

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,080
uh and adapt to change with their

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,080
software

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,599
uh in order to be competitive in

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,720
whatever environment they're competing

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,960
in

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,160
and so you know we had waterfall and

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,240
agile those are

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,599
methodologies for for building software

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,560
that came along

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,080
years ago devops now is a 10 year old

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,039
term

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,960
and you know was the idea that we want

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,080
to marry development and operations in a

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,560
way that we can

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
get software out the door faster to our

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,360
customers

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,360
and then really we have this you know

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,720
more recently the this concept of cloud

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,599
native the reason we're all together

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,759
here right

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
this is i want dynamic environments i

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,840
want to be able to scale

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,479
up and down with demand uh i want to be

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,599
able to

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,599
yes deploy quickly and and and scale

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,160
quickly

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,680
and you know this line is kind of like a

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,199
like a straight line

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,280
but i would say it's almost curved right

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,319
because each of these innovations

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,639
not only allows us to continue to grow

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,400
um software development as a as an

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,039
industry but it also accelerates

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,479
that speed of delivery and so cloud

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,440
native has definitely done that

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,800
and you know when we talk about every

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,360
company

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
being a software company well then you

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
end up with all of these companies that

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,960
have

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,479
you know stories that are then related

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
to cloud native right these

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,800
these are just pictures i literally took

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,240
off of uh the kubernetes

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,759
customer stories website you know images

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
of

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,280
company logos but i think it tells a

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,000
really interesting story the

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,000
different kinds of enterprises and

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,479
companies that you find there

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,520
who are leveraging kubernetes for its

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,120
value

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,639
but really to solve very different

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,879
problems right you have banks right

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,680
there's large banks like capital one

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
ing you know these these banks are

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,959
typically

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,680
banks we typically think of banks as

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,399
kind of

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,519
late adopters to software or industry

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,599
trends

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,200
right they move slowly they're very

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,720
particular

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,920
but even in banking right it's been

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:53,200
disrupted in many ways by software

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,519
and so we see those those folks

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
uh needing to innovate still within

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,680
their bounds

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,480
uh that they have right or we see you

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,399
know

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,240
um traditional journalism like new york

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,680
times um right that

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,760
obviously is a world that's hugely

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,519
changed uh since the advent of the

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,720
internet and

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,320
in order to kind of preserve their their

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
business and their ability to

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,800
produce uh content and journalism they

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,360
have to be able to move faster

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,560
uh and then you even see ibm right like

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,880
the oldest

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,600
uh company when it comes to computers

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,360
and

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,920
and uh software or any of any kind

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
right also embracing cloud native right

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
they

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,160
they really embrace it as they as they

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,600
purchased red hat

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,880
who has a lot of products based around

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,160
kubernetes and other cloud native

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,680
technologies

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,480
um but they use kubernetes themselves to

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,440
uh you know enable that fast to market

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
software

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
and so those are kind of the you know

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,640
large enterprises that see this as a as

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,880
a competitive advantage

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,240
but then on the other side is startups

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
right that also see this as a huge

00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,200
competitive advantage to be able to

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,320
reach scale without investing the kind

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,000
of money

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,920
and resources that those larger

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,320
enterprises would be able to so

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,160
kind of the other side of that coin is

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,040
you know cloud native enables those

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,079
companies

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,519
uh to be able to be competitive and and

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
scale

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,160
in a way that's that's you know new in a

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,320
lot of ways right the internet did this

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
for sure but cloud native adds another

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,959
layer on top of it where

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,040
you don't need a massive capital outlay

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,920
a massive investment of money

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,760
uh in order to you know build a business

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,000
that can scale to the globe

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,880
um we've seen that happen time and time

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,440
again

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,800
uh with startups who live in the cloud

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,279
they are really the cloud native right

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
they

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,480
they were born in the cloud and and live

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
there

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,160
uh but we've also seen uh academia and

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,480
and research institutions make huge

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,440
strides right we just heard

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,880
uh about data and and and data in cloud

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,959
native

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,160
where we have these universities and

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,279
large academic

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,360
um or non-profit organizations that

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,360
are leveraging cloud native to do

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
exactly that to to

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
level up what they're doing with data

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
again to

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
build a scale that they wouldn't

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,920
otherwise be able to

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,440
uh just from a you know cost prohibitive

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,200
perspective

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,519
they can do things that they were

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,519
weren't able to even dream of

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,519
uh before the cloud and cloud native

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,480
technology

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,240
and so those stories really show us that

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,800
you know cloud native touches

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
all of these different areas uh and so

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,640
because of that i mean that's

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
i guess again a lot of preaching to the

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,000
choir if you will

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
um you know you're maybe bought into

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,120
that uh that's why you're here

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,640
so i think a natural question is well

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,079
well what's next right

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,560
so we've got kubernetes that's been

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,320
around for quite some time um

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,600
we've all these other fantastic projects

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,320
many of which are

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,959
presenting here today you know where do

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
i

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
focus my energy as a technologist to say

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,800
you know these are the things that i

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,920
want to understand more

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,959
because they're up and coming and so one

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,399
of those things is

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,519
is kubernetes at the edge um and so the

00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
edge can

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,560
can mean a lot of things it can mean you

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,680
know connected devices or

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,399
internet of things or iot devices but it

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,720
can also mean

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,160
sensors and equipment for lots of

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,440
different platforms that live at the

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,720
edge

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,600
and the sheer volume

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800
uh of the data created by all of these

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,320
devices right there's

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,600
something like 30 billion connected

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
devices i don't even know how you count

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,480
that but

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,240
but folks make an attempt to count that

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,880
uh in a market of

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,880
700 billion going to a trillion dollars

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,920
uh in the next six years

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,560
for these kinds of devices so the volume

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,600
of

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,639
data and information well data created

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,760
by let's let's

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,600
let's separate data and information so

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,279
data just raw data created by these

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,639
devices you know staggering amount of

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,880
data

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,959
and so to turn that data into useful

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,720
information

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,160
you have to have more processing power

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,240
out near them

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,839
to process and send that collected data

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,040
that aggregated data that aggregated

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,880
information

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,360
back into your cloud services right you

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,240
can't just stream all of that data all

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,279
the time

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,399
um necessarily and so that's where the

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,920
edge comes to be

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,360
and so again i haven't really

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,959
clearly defined what the edge is right

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,160
it could be these internet of things

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,600
devices but

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,240
really i think the way to think about

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:36,720
the edge is

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
um to define it as to what it's not

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,959
right so

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,199
you have endpoints which are the end

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:44,000
user devices and the other

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,880
uh data generating devices and you have

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,639
your core

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,079
which is like your core infrastructure

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,240
maybe that's in the cloud

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,440
or it's on premise and and the edge

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,560
lives somewhere in the middle there

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,320
right so this is

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,320
things that might be are closer to those

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,120
endpoints

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,320
but might have computing power

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
requirements

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,560
before that data gets sent back into the

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,639
core infrastructure

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,440
and so it can mean a lot of things and

00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,600
we've seen it mean a lot of things so

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,800
there's a lot of mission-critical

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,279
decisions

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,199
that happen to happen on that edge right

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,720
based on what the current data is what

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:25,040
the previous models we had were

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,040
and these are you know grandiose

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,920
versions of that right kubernetes in

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,440
your car you know obviously that's

00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:34,320
something we could all think of

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,839
um but then also nasa is you know

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,000
putting kubernetes clusters now and

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,199
devices that it's flying out into space

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,120
into the moon

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,600
um we see the european space age and

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
other space agencies doing that as well

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,440
in the u.s air force putting it inside

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,519
of a fighter jet

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,519
so these are places where there's a lot

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
of data being generated

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,600
and a huge need for processing power

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,959
there at the edge

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,320
but there's other simpler things right

00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,440
these are kind of grandiose things you

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,079
know

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,720
if you think of surveillance systems or

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,800
road or

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,720
toll or traffic management systems

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,360
lighting asset tracking

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,079
right there's lots and lots of things at

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,519
the edge that

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
need this kind of computing power and

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,079
that's why talking about kubernetes at

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,600
the edge and

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,160
and things like uh k3s and and ways of

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,000
running kubernetes in a lightweight way

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,880
but still leveraging all the benefits of

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
it

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,839
uh is is going to be a trend that's

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,839
going to be around for a while

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,199
and you know the the the growing uh

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:39,040
spread of 5g and other you know fast

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:39,759
broadband wireless technology is going

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,000
to only

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,440
increase that throughput and increase

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,839
the amount of data that's coming through

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,839
the edge

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,800
so second another trend that i think is

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,800
is still being figured out is it's

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
called service mesh and

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,759
uh so again let's let's talk about that

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,360
and kind of define it well i think

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,959
before you can define service mesh you

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,600
really have to understand

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,959
what a micro service is and then again

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,560
differentiating

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,800
microservices from a service mesh

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,920
because they're kind of interrelated

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,399
so a microservice right the idea of that

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,600
is

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,360
you know we used to build um only these

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,959
large monolith software applications

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,320
that you know kind of is one

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,399
code base that does everything um

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,839
you know does all of the transaction

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,360
processing it does all of the business

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,079
logic it does all of the

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
you know handling of login and identity

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,000
and all of that

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,160
in kind of one massive monolith the idea

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,720
of microservices is you break that

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,399
into distinct services right there's an

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,000
identity service there's a

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,440
payment processing service uh and

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,519
you know that's a that's a fantastic

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,639
idea for a lot of businesses because

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,279
at a large enterprise you're going to

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
have massive teams uh that have to then

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,519
figure out

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,880
you know who's working on what uh and

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,759
how do we you know

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,480
distinguish changes between one another

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,079
um

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,079
but the question quickly becomes how

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,120
will you scale it and this is

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,679
a fantastic little fun illustration from

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,160
a friend of mine on twitter chloe condon

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,160
and

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,079
i have to anytime i say talk about scale

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
i have to just include it just because i

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,400
think it's a lot of fun

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,520
and that's really where service mesh

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,959
comes in and why there's been so much

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,000
discussion over the past year

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,079
and will continue to be a lot of

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,320
discussion about service mesh

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,120
in the cloud native space and the reason

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,440
for that

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,160
if i can click is service mesh tries to

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,280
create a layer where we're able to

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,600
control

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,960
you know a lot about these micro

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,360
services right we have all these micro

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,679
services

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,720
if we just connect them all together

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,400
individually

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,480
you have a lot of connection points to

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,320
think about and what's the right

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,120
you know level of data access between

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,080
this service a and service b

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,919
but using a service mesh allows you to

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,080
place kind of a proxy layer

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,880
where all of the metrics about traffic

00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,120
and routing and how do we retry

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,640
and when do we time out and how do we

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:15,120
turn something on and off

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,440
um is uh is you know controlled within

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,880
that service mesh control plane

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
uh and so that's why you see a lot of

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
folks talking about you know there was a

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,679
lot of

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,280
uh kerfuffle last year about which

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
service mesh is best

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,200
um i won't get into all that but i do

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,400
think service meshes

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,880
is something that's going to be around

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,960
for a while as

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,720
more folks adopt microservices and see

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,080
that while it is a great

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,640
model it quickly can

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,559
spiral out of control if you don't have

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,840
a way to centrally control it which

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,000
of course you did on a monolith

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,480
so those are the kind of cloud native

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,240
technologies i want to look after

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,799
but i also think there's some industry

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,160
trends and i honestly don't know why

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,960
i drew this line i mean it's somewhat

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,000
arbitrary

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,559
but i think that there's these trends

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,880
really

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,240
impact the whole software industry and

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,039
not just the cloud native community

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,880
although

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,240
that could be argued for for either side

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,679
of any of these

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,799
um and so there's a couple of things i

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,000
want to talk about there that i think

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,000
are becoming really important

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,600
the first and and maybe the most

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,039
critical is

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,799
is supply chain security this is

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,400
something that's gotten a lot of

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,440
attention recently

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,039
um and i think the reason that it's now

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,880
getting so much attention i mean supply

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,520
chain attacks right attacking

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,880
somewhere along the supply chain it has

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,080
been around as long as

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,480
humanity humanity's been around right

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,280
that's if you read sun tzu's the art of

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,039
war

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,200
you'll you'll read about supply chain

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,120
attacks um

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,520
but i think they're getting software

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,559
supply chain attacks are getting so much

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,360
focus currently because we're at a point

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,799
where

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,280
there's a lot of organizations and

00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,960
enterprises who have really matured

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,720
their security practices fairly well

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,760
and created you know defensive

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,039
perimeters and other areas where

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:11,440
they're they're relatively secure

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,559
and so then attackers decide to then

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,400
find

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,880
the suppliers to those organizations

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
that may be less mature security wise

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,400
and an attack there we've seen that in

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,679
this the sunburst

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,600
solarwinds attack uh just this week an

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,440
attack on homebrew

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,120
and so these kinds of attacks and and

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,640
how you secure everything along your

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,960
supply chain

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
is something that's really being focused

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,720
on and

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,960
it's going to lead to a lot of

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,159
discussions

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:44,240
another technology is ebpf so this is

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:46,640
a kind of an advanced sort of linux

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,799
kernel feature but one that's getting a

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,159
lot of attention and

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:51,919
and the reason for that is again as you

00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,760
have this kind of explosion

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,600
of services that are maybe running on

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,159
top of the linux machine

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,520
uh ebpf provides this kind of native

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,640
entry point

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,080
um that's a natural extension for you

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,080
know controlling networking and

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,320
observability

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,760
without you know layering in a whole

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,120
bunch of other stuff outside of the

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,360
kernel

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,200
and so i think this is a technology that

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,520
you know developers may

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,400
uh want to follow but definitely

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,559
operators and

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,400
and and folks that are running systems

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,400
are going to want to understand

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,240
as it becomes more popular

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,159
and then finally i think this is kind of

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,600
a general catch-all

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,679
category but i think it's one that's

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,440
important and this is like tooling

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
and the experience for developers and

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,039
operators so

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,280
we're seeing a huge kind of influx in

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,960
how do we give developers and operators

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,120
a great experience and make it really

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,200
easy to do their jobs and so

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,200
there's probably a dozen things i could

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,799
talk about here

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,559
you know get ops is one thing you hear a

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,760
lot about right this is the

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,640
how do i get the code that we're writing

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:02,000
into production into kubernetes uh into

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,799
my cloud native technology is

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,400
as best as i can and a lot of folks are

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,799
seeing that you know

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
maybe having an agent that's pulling

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,440
that

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,760
those changes into the cluster is better

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
than something that pushes it

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,200
that's kind of again more of a

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,600
kubernetes methodology that i want to

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,480
state my desired state and have some

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,880
agent

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:25,039
uh making that true right so that's how

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,960
you can think of get ops

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,799
of course artificial intelligence

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,440
machine learning i mean it's

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,880
it's something we've we talk about a lot

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,120
but it's more and more being seen as

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,960
like a key solution to a wide scope of

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,640
challenges for businesses

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,799
and you know it's really challenging

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,760
design and build and implement

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,559
successfully

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,280
at scale and production settings and so

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,799
tools around cloud native like kubeflow

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,640
are really bringing a lot of that

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,960
tooling um

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,880
you know kind of to maturity in a way

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,880
that you can bring all of that together

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,480
and then dx or developer experience

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,120
again this is something that

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,320
we've seen huge focus on we're seeing

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,760
consolidation

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,080
in the devops tooling space you know

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,039
there's less and less companies doing it

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,600
more companies are doing more um and i

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,960
think

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,200
developers and operators are going to

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,640
come to expect that all of these tools

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,760
are just integrated into a single

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,760
platform

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,120
that allows kind of the dual goal of

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,840
getting software built and shipped

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,440
quickly but also maintaining and

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,960
operating that software

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,960
in the future together

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,919
so okay let's say those are the trends

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,679
today

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,000
you know what's next how can you you

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,960
possibly possibly uh

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,400
keep up with all this and and so that's

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,320
a great question

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,159
and so how could you possibly keep up

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,720
with all these trends well i think

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,159
the the clear answer is well you can't

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
it's not possible right and i don't

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,919
think you should put

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,120
pressure on yourselves you know um to

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,360
understand and

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,559
have a grasp of all of these technology

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,159
changes and

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,360
um you know know everything about them

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,279
and dive a mile deep i mean they're

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,159
going to come and go

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,840
and so that's hard but i i think you can

00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,559
try like i think you can

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,039
do a number of things to enable yourself

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,720
to be

00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,320
adaptive uh in our industry um

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,159
i think the the number one way to do

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
that is just to accept

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,200
you're going to be in a constant state

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,480
of learning and be okay with that like

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,200
that's how it works i don't know

00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,919
very much and the more i learn the less

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,880
i you know

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,679
know or the more i know i don't know and

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,640
and that's okay

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,320
right um but there's a lot of great ways

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,360
i think that you can

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:42,080
enable yourself to be learning um

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,840
one i i'd highly encourage you to attend

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,120
cubecon and if you

00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,080
uh are having an issue with with making

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,760
that happen

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,520
please you know find me on twitter and

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,840
let me know i'd like to help

00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,360
um i think you should follow folks i

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,880
think twitter is a great place to follow

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,080
folks that you're interested in

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,440
uh topics you're interested in and then

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,440
on the cncf side if you're not in the

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,880
cncf slack

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,559
i highly recommend joining that there's

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
lots of

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,799
channels for different areas that you

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,600
might be interested in

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,200
and then also sigs so let's let's talk

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,880
about that so folks to follow

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,120
um i just put a couple here kelsey

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,480
hightower if you're not following him

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,400
you have to follow him i also would

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,640
recommend following priyanka priyanka

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,400
sharma is the the general manager of the

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,279
cncf she's speaking at this conference

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,760
as well

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:32,400
but she really helps highlight all the

00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,919
things that team cloud native is doing

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,480
also take a look at the ambassador

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,600
program from the cncf

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,279
it's a great program and there's a lot

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,640
of great folks all across the world that

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,240
you can follow from that

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,520
and of course shamelessly i'll just plug

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,000
that you should follow me at a larry

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,120
crew

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,720
on twitter um but i also encourage you

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,080
to you know take a look at what

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,559
the special interest groups are doing so

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,279
these are called sigs and you know these

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,480
groups

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:58,480
focus on a very specific uh topic

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,679
and they they create a lot of great

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,960
information

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:02,159
so for instance i talked about supply

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,039
chain security if that's something that

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,600
you're

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,520
interested in sig security right now is

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,320
working on a huge paper

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,080
on supply chain security and i've

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,600
learned so much from just

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,480
just kind of from afar watching those

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,440
folks uh work on that paper

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,320
and then also i think it's been

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
mentioned um but there's also

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,840
you know finally a mentoring program if

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,080
you're looking for a mentor

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,360
there's a huge mentoring program uh as a

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,200
part of the cncf and i would really

00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,279
encourage you to check that out

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,960
um and that would be great and it it's

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
even on github and i work for gitlab but

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,799
that's how much i care about

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,039
the mentoring program um you know sign

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,000
up for that

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,640
