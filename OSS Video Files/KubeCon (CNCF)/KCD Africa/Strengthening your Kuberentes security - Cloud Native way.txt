Title: Strengthening your Kuberentes security - Cloud Native way
Publication date: 2021-06-01
Playlist: KCD Africa
Description: 
	Attackers always get better with new attack techniques, so our threat modelling and defense mechanisms need to level up.

The aim of the presentation is to demonstrate the kind of attacks that are possible due to
misconfigurations. In particular, through the use of multiple examples, I will explain scenarios
such as how misconfigured cluster privileges can lead to backdooring cloud environments,
avoid detection by manipulating logging controls and access sensitive information and trade
secrets due to IAM, pod security policy and webhook misconfigurations. The presentation
will also include the demonstration of the tool, Kubestriker which is designed to perform
automatic checks and scans to detect various misconfigurations and mitigate such
consequences.
