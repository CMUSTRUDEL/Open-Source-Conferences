Description: 
	Emmanuel Bakare is a DevOps Engineer with effective skills in Containers, Virtualisation and Linux administration. 
He also stands as an effective community manager having put together communities like GDG UNILAG and currently manages the Google Cloud Community in Lagos which facilitates the first ever recurring Linux meetup in Nigeria.
Asides code, community and work, he is also an avid traveller who enjoys every bit of a new experience. From paragliding off the mountains of CapeTown to future skydiving attempts off the altitudes of this planet, he also speaks French (kinda, vous comprends?!) and enjoys visiting countries and conferences, like the ones he is speaking at when you accept his talk.

when i speak on the community track is

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,680
uh

00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,319
emmanuel bakari he'll be speaking to us

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,319
how he

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,599
got his certified communities at uh

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,040
application developer and also how he

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,160
became a certified communities

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,920
administrator

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
it's an awesome experience to have him

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:24,240
here he's

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,439
a linux guru so um

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,840
imano are you ready awesome to have you

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,519
yeah definitely how's it going good

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,520
morning

it's awesome i'll handle it over to you

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,719
and

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,480
we'll be switching the enterprise

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,280
channel to uh

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:47,520
live stream what's your email

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,480
okay hello

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,879
can you hear me and can you also see my

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,879
screen

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:13,840
okay hello everyone

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,000
okay

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:33,200
okay hello everyone how's it going yes

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,040
um so my name is emmanuel bakare um

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,320
and i'm an infrastructure engineer and

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,240
at the moment

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,640
i would be um covering details on how i

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,680
went from not having any kubernetes

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
certifications

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,479
to i'm taking up the cka and

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,600
ckad i took both exams within a period

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,640
of a week

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,759
and it all worked fine so here's how it

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,119
actually went so

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,320
i'm just going to start off with like an

00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,439
intro to work keep an eye to this

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,479
because i think a lot of people

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,399
might not really know what it does so

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,960
what kubernetes basically helps you with

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,720
is um covering details on like how your

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,879
infrastructure should be

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,080
you know how you're going to um

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,280
typically move on

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,640
from getting started with kubernetes to

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,000
actually um using it so fibonacci

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,840
basically helps you manage

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,040
your entire application stacks your

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,000
networking

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,120
um storage all of this you know within

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
like a very very

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,040
compact um yamu format that you can

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,800
pretty much write up

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,480
um there's quite a lot of documentation

00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
about it online it's a really

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,959
really really easy process using

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,400
containers and everything

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,080
but then the really good part about it

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
actually nexus manages a lot of things

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,560
that we

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
have done in the past you know like

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,400
scaling up vms

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,160
managing security managing you know

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
network interfaces not

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,440
this that's like everything just kind of

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,400
like patch it all together

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
like a really really nice um you know as

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,319
a very nice orchestration engine

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,760
so um kubernetes has some certifications

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,000
because of the fact that the platform is

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,159
really

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,360
big and like it's being used like across

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,760
like different organizations like

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,959
you know everyone pretty much uses it um

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
it's come to be like

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,959
almost a standard for like you know for

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,400
managing applications

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,319
um at least from like a global scale um

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,239
so they have certifications that i know

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,319
people who are starting off can actually

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,319
know what they should be heading for

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,480
you know the kind of um skills that they

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,480
should have which is interventions

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
um things like okay fine how does you

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,959
know what are the various components

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,959
that make your benefits work

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,799
what's the control manager why is that

00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,480
needed it's easy so the certifications

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,400
kind of assist you become like figuring

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,040
out okay i should be focusing a lot on

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,640
this

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,239
and working towards you know getting

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,879
everything up and going yeah

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,680
so moving on we have like what the

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,159
certification

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,560
are and then we have like you know this

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,799
we have cka which is like the kubernetes

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,080
administrator certification so what this

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,439
is mostly focused on is

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,400
okay i have um some

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,920
um clusters somewhere i'm getting like

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
some issues all of a sudden i can't

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,159
deploy applications on it

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,120
so oh yeah trying to deploy the cluster

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,280
and you're getting like some weird

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,759
errors things like that that's what um

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,519
the main focus for cka is on

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
okay without the application even

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
working like can you actually just get

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,199
the cluster running you know maximum

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,800
security maximum performance you know

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
what are the problems we will have how

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,199
many nodes do we need things like that

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,400
that's what the ck is really really

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,320
focused on

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,639
the ckd on the other hand is mostly

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,479
focused on the application side so like

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,080
okay i'm deploying my application what

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,919
are the things i need okay i need the

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,280
application to access another service in

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,720
a different name space

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,160
okay like talk policies to how what kind

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
of security do i need

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
but i still be speaking quite a lot on

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,199
network policies and later on

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,880
so things like what the application

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,240
really needs that's what the

00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,080
cka is majorly focused on um it's also a

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,840
new one that came out cks

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,360
i like to say pandemic because 2020 is

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,400
kind of like a crossword um

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,919
at this point um so what this ks is

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,199
mostly focused on is the security side

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,120
of humanity so

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
uh in this case i'm going to be checking

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,639
out you should be using

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,520
um so things like from the node cluster

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,479
level

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,479
um i've not really taken so much notes

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,759
of this particular certification

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,440
it's something i'm still prepping on

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
doing but it's covering like a lot of

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
like linux security fundamentals

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,400
container security

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,680
cluster securities and network security

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,039
everything all together

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,360
um so that you can manage which

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,280
applications and clusters quite nicely

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,120
on kubernetes so um the main talk about

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,720
it

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,639
um because um so around um

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
the cka and ck that mostly most of the

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,880
kubernetes education that's actually

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,360
hard

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,039
and to be honest it actually is because

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
it's a very practical exam

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,720
you're going to be working your way

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,880
around actually typing commands

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,919
um investigating things so it's pretty

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,120
much like you're having like some

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,639
production downtime

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:05,280
for real like it's um simulated to be

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,880
in a live environment that's what it's

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,880
actually quite endorsed

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,800
um and i can say that it's a really good

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,400
exam because after getting both i kind

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,280
of like go like multiple job or first

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,280
like weeks

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,800
which was pretty much a fun thing

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,199
that's one because of the fact i just

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,960
had it so so i really say it's a good

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,720
idea to actually take the exam

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,639
um there are like a lot of opportunities

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,960
just having it so

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
um the easiest way to actually pass this

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,680
is actually by deploying the clusters

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,600
manually

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,639
so a lot of the time like when you're

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,720
actually trying to manage your

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,360
kubernetes clusters you mostly start off

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,400
with um you know getting on

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,479
um using them you know aws or some cloud

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,000
provider or something like that but

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
for this you are not really going to

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,680
have to do that everyone even during the

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,479
exams they do deploy the clusters for

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
you

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,160
but they deploy the clusters with 40

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,759
configurations and

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
you can never actually fix those

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,160
problems unless you've actually done it

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,720
yourself

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,840
and speaking from experience um it is

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,759
quite a lot so it's almost like you're

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,520
managing the clusters on prem

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,759
um for those who might have done that

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,280
kudos to you cks should actually be a

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,960
lot easier from there

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,319
but if not you do have some things to

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,800
cover up on

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,080
it's particularly important for the ckas

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,039
but it could also then come into the

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,639
ckeds

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,080
when things like oh you have a faulty

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,160
scheduler configuration

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,360
and you know pods just can't you know

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
start because you know they can't get

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,720
scheduled to use things like that

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,039
that's like where this all comes in

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,880
handy the next thing is actually to take

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,560
courses on kubernetes so as

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,919
opposed to actually a lot of courses but

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,639
the one i mostly recommend is called

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,319
cloud

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,000
um mostly because of the fact that they

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,880
have practice tests and like the

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,479
instructors

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,400
doesn't mohammed was actually really

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,400
really thorough in terms of like his

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,560
explanations of like what this does

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,840
the various components how they apply

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,639
and then the way that you can actually

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,319
use them

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,639
so you're not just like doing a course

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,360
you're actually doing a practical exam

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,759
across the course as you move along um

00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
and also it's really helped because

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,120
imagine like you are learning something

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,520
and you're doing it at the same time

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,199
and then you also now have like some

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,919
simulated environment that's close to

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,360
the cka and cjd environments that's the

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,759
exam environment so

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,160
it's almost like you are actually

00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,240
practicing to write the exam

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,759
um it so like there are two courses here

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,039
the humanities administrator of the

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,400
practice test and there's also the

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,840
certification course which is like a

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,520
bundle of both of them

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,960
so most time just advice that you use

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,240
code cloud if you actually prepare for

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,120
the ctf securities

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,919
you can't go wrong i'm checking that the

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,000
next thing is to actually practice

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,839
with a natural platform that was built

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,279
to help you pass it so

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,560
um cloud basically has the simulated

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,279
environments but the questions don't

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,360
really cover the full depth of the exam

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:47,279
so why not take a practice exam that is

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,880
exactly like cks that's what killer the

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
essentially provides

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,519
so killer sh is um is literally spells

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,880
killer shell

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,640
so what they do there is that like they

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,240
basically have like resources

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,760
and some questions that are

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,920
almost similar to the ones you would

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,720
actually have in the ck and ckd

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,000
when i took them so i took mdc cascade

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,839
like between weeks

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,600
so i basically practiced for like maybe

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,839
a month on the cka

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,160
then i used collado sh a week before my

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,560
cka i got a 92 there

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,320
i did my cjd i got 90 there and then

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,880
pretty much um

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,360
it just went like that so killer sh was

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,600
actually

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,560
it's it's actually the ck exam you get

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,959
proctored

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,560
you have a shell it's the exact

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,839
environment like what you see during ck

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,640
exam it's the best thing you can

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,480
actually use

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,360
for preparing for any of the exams they

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,680
also have a cks um

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,200
um simulation so it's kind of like

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,720
everything that you'd actually need

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,240
i always recommend this for anyone that

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,200
asks about writing an exam because it's

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,279
really the best

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,560
it's is a bit pricey depending on which

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,279
part of the world you are

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,480
in um it's about 30 euros um so

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,399
depending on like how

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,600
um where you are it's not really that

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
expensive but

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,279
um the fact that you have three exams in

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,959
like one single payment and then you can

00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,399
like schedule it over a year

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,000
it kind of like makes it very easy for

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,240
you to take some time

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,320
do the quick cloud courses take some

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,360
time do a test exam and see how you

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,880
perform

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
and then down the line in the exam

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:15,360
should actually be quite great

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,720
um and also one of the really good parts

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,160
that really saved me a ton of time

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,040
because it's actually

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,959
because you have a lot of questions some

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,760
questions carry a lot more but you also

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,240
didn't have to

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,440
finish the um question within like a set

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,959
of time limits

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,480
so the best thing to do is actually to

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,640
shorten the commands

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,320
i know that this saved me a ton of time

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,320
because while working through most of

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
the exams and everything i pretty much

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,000
was able to

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,519
um walk around getting things done

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,440
finishing up on

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,600
everything so you can show to the

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,880
commands i didn't do an example right

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
here where you can do something like you

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
know you can't throw any layers

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
into your batch rc and you can't you

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
know use that command as you move along

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,480
this really really really helps

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,200
especially if you are not faster typing

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,959
so like during my cka i know i forgot to

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,560
do this but i'm pretty fast it was

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,920
pretty easy for me to like walk around

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,279
you know getting everything done

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,959
but if you know you're not that fast

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,079
then this could be a very very nice hack

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,000
to pass the exam

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,839
and also then also because you have a

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
lot of questions and when you're under

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,959
attention you know type in those long

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,920
commands and making typos can't really

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,000
offset your

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,279
mental dynamic data like you know

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,320
getting through it

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,000
so this is actually really great

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
and then the last thing is actually to

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,959
practice um so

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,959
um here

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
so practice makes perfect um you you

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,079
actually can't

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,839
scan your way through this exam you

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,640
can't read a couple books

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,399
you know um it's it's it's not like most

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,839
certifications exams this one they

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,800
really really really

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,720
have a high priority check on pragmatism

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,320
and also you're protected by an external

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,760
examiner so you know you can't just

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,959
bring your friend in they'll be like oh

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,040
i need to google

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
a book you you can't google some things

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,839
but it's very limited

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
to just the docs and the api references

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,760
so it's not like you can just go up and

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,560
copy some you know you actually have to

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,399
learn

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,519
what skills are there and then the

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,240
various parts are needed it is ctc

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,360
so you have to really really practice to

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,120
pass the exam

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,360
but the part that i can say that if you

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,600
use killer sh really well

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
i really because you can't really like

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
you actually have to type most of the

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,120
commands there

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,880
um you really would have any issues with

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
going through most of the exams and

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,920
everything and you know

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,680
just getting started and right to the

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,279
end so um

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,720
there's really not much here because

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,399
it's a lot of work from

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,079
your end regarding like working your way

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
through the exams um

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,240
through the test questions through um

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,000
some of the materials i'll be online

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,519
and most of the time make sure you check

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,360
online for like how people pass their

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
sis most times the same advice

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
but the most times leave out the

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,560
practice tests um platforms which is

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,880
what i actually added here

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,000
and um if you just use those yeah pretty

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,880
much visible

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,399
yeah so um if there are no more if there

00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,959
are any questions then there will be a

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
good time

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:07,839
yeah coco

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,839
oh yeah abu bakr that's good

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,079
okay any questions

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,760
awesome yeah that was an awesome session

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,000
um

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,440
do we have any questions i think the

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,199
chat has been posing

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,839
since uh let's see if

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,760
there have been any christians so far

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,760
okay lovely

00:13:49,920 --> 00:14:03,839
awesome yeah that was an awesome session

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,120
okay um how do you imagine yeah

00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,920
[Music]

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,600
okay um so regarding managing time okay

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,880
someone is asking how you manage

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,839
your time yes okay yeah so um

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,680
and asaka um so regarding managing time

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
um one of the easiest ways to manage

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,600
time during the exam

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,600
is so so does this hack do all these

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,360
simple questions first

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,720
because um when you're writing the exam

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,800
you have various um

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,040
questions for um with different levels

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,880
so you pretty much have to do the easy

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,000
questions first i always advise that

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,199
because those are the ones that really

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
waste your time

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,399
like they're very simple but they're

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,839
also

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:54,880
like very um repetitive

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,560
so as you move to like if you're like

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,959
doing the commands thing that i showed

00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,040
before

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,560
setting aliases you just find yourself

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,839
reusing those and then you're saving

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,519
time in the long term

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,279
because you're going to type cube ctrl a

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,839
lots of times like you

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,560
really lost so the first thing is to

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,240
shorten the command second thing is to

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,920
practice with the test so that at least

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,880
you have like um some

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,360
idea of like how the question should be

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,560
um

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:25,199
next thing is here we will uh

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:28,480
rightly proceed to the next session

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,680
uh since we have okay we still have

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,480
roughly 18 minutes

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
to see if we can still join while we

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,440
prepare

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:41,839
for the next session okay

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
so um

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,120
okay so um so okay so i consider a lot

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,399
of questions

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:02,399
mostly due to the uh

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,759
from the stage side so let me put the

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,839
first one

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,839
which is um covered on

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,399
okay the first question is

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,839
on sharing my slides so yes i would

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:22,000
actually share my slides i'll put them

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:25,120
in twitter

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,800
um the second question which is

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,959
enchilada sh um yes yes so until they

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,720
said you have to pay for the practicals

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,199
um it's actually needed that you pay for

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:38,800
them they don't really host it free

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,560
um one but but but like

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,800
but like if you really want to take it i

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,279
could actually assist you with um

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,560
getting like the ck or ckd setup um you

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,920
have my twitter you can just actually

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,880
possibly something i've done in the past

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,639
for some people so

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,759
it's just fine um so i'm getting started

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,120
with the cka

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,720
and john cena um you can um

00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,920
just google it a lot of the time the

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,440
certifications and the links are

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
actually available online

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,959
so everything kind of just works great

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,199
there um

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:12,000
yeah so um the next part is also

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,120
on uh what kind of resources i recommend

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,600
you most so

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,880
the thing about the see the kubernetes

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,079
exams is that they are actually

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,880
practical

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,480
so resources um is mostly called cloud

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,760
and child's go shell because

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,319
when i went through most of them

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,480
starting off um most of the medium blogs

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,520
were nice but they don't really cover in

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,200
like how the exam actually would go

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,640
from like your perspective you know they

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,080
can describe it but

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
it's actually a different experience for

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,840
each participant so i would say the best

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:44,400
you can actually take up

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:44,400
is code cloud and kill other essays

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,960
like those are the best to produce okay

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,480
um okay from a linux foundation there

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,080
really isn't so much

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,760
you can actually take oh yes there's

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,120
actually a course on kubernetes from the

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,720
linux foundation

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,280
that is also another part that you could

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,760
take um so i didn't really use

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,280
that one um it's actually also very

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,799
comprehensive and you can use that to

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,520
actually pass the exams

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,280
but um or at that time i mostly just

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,919
used to cloud until i don't share

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,679
yeah um so how long do you take me to

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,480
study for the actual exam

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,000
so um for the cka i spent about two to

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,960
three weeks studying

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,480
so so that was that i was already um

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,240
used to working with humanities i've

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,559
been using it for about two years

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,679
so it's so so it's a lot of like the

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,799
debugging

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,400
um downtime experience you know so like

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,880
production experience with it so it was

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
pretty

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,799
straightforward to like work my way

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,120
around it here's how i was able to

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,559
walk through most of the exams um so

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,679
this is um from massive

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,360
geomanic um okay

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,799
the next steps after taking the cka

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,760
certification

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,200
so um i would actually say that the

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,160
certifications are meant to

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,520
help you with um showcasing your

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,160
experience

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,600
because um because personality like um

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,400
having a secret secret doesn't mean you

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,840
get a job

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,600
yet but for most of my entire

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,360
experiences the fact that i had

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,280
really high scores kind of like just

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,160
pushed me edge in the interviews

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,520
so i wouldn't actually say that um

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,480
dealing with these certifications should

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,480
be the goal

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,919
but mostly acing them really well so

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,360
that you can showcase that as like a

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,799
metric for your experience

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,120
you know it's basically like doing

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,960
school and getting a c versus an a

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,240
you know like if you really want to get

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,760
an a you get an a and

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,360
you definitely have opportunities from

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,120
there um

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,480
regarding the cloud provider side it's

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,039
pretty much the same

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,679
platform so you wouldn't really have any

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,679
issues you can just continue with um

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,360
you know focusing on using kubernetes it

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,600
doesn't really matter it's very platform

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,320
agnostic

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,520
um really fun today be to pursue the

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:50,480
lfcs

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,240
so um the lfcs would actually be nice so

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,679
that you could at least cover your linux

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,160
experience

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,720
and then do the ck sdk because most of

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
the

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,240
vms you'll be using during the exam are

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,520
actually a linux virtual machine so

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,440
so all your experience will just be

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,720
needed from there so yes

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,799
taking it is not really a prerequisite

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,679
but it is an optional advantage to take

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,679
the course yeah

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,840
okay any more questions

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,840
okay

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:39,039
i think i've answered all the questions

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,440
okay yeah

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,440
coco

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:56,080
awesome um thank you very much valkyrie

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,080
i think that's a question okay

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,799
um replication

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,679
but the good part about the cncf is that

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,200
they offer you

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,760
um discounts um you can actually write

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,360
in

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,880
for for like a discount on your cka exam

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
they're actually that generous like i

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,200
remember that i did mine at a 50

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,720
off during that period which was like

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,919
really great so i saved like a ton

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,000
because it's about three hundred dollars

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,840
to write the exam so i paid 150 150 for

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,159
both the ck and ckd

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,080
and you know that was like 300 so i took

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,840
two courses for the price of one

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,520
so you could actually write directly to

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,280
the foundation they offer scholarships

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,640
full scholarships either way

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,880
um yeah um what roadmap would you advise

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,600
for a total beginner um

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,640
so the roadmap that i would advise is

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,120
mostly to

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
one at least gets um started with using

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,360
the platform

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,799
and there's this um there's this

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,960
particular um

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,960
thing from chelsea hightower to venetian

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,080
hardware

00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,400
um so i'll send the link in this stage

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,679
chat so like if you wanted to start off

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,360
you could walk through this it's

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,640
actually one of the

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:10,480
best and i think more standard way to

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:12,240
jump in to jump into like the platform

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,320
and you know getting started with it in

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,120
like the best way possible

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,880
so i would actually say this would be

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,799
one of the easiest ways at the beginning

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,280
to get started it would take a while

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,039
but it's very very convenient for your

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,000
learning process and you end up cooking

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,240
a lot and learning a lot

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,919
sending taking the exams isn't really

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,200
like a problem for them

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,200
okay any more questions

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,880
okay seems like it's good yeah

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:54,559
okay cool then so um thank you everyone

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:56,640
um and do have a good day

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
