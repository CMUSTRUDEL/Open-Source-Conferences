We’d like to announce our latest open-source project: Racklet. It’s a fully-integrated, Raspberry Pi form-factor server rack and software stack that aims to be a scale model of hyperscaler datacenters. All layers of the stack are 100% OSS/OSH, and will be developed together with the community. It’s reproducible through open PCB designs, 3D printed casing, and commodity, off-the-shelf hardware.

We want to lower the barrier of entry for becoming cloud native. Racklet aims to inspire users to explore how modern server architectures work, in a tangible and educational way. Emphasis is put on security, knowledge sharing, extensibility, and portability.

The goal is to conceptually map to real environments and provide an accessible and well-documented path to welcome future talents to the world of cloud native.
