hi everyone this is the state of the

00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,839
service smash

00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,720
panel my name is linson i'm the director

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,360
of open source with solo.i oh i

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,799
am super excited to moderate the panel

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,160
for you

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,800
we have an excellent line of panelists

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,279
uh edith can you introduce yourself for

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,199
sure

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,359
uh so my name is edith levine and i'm

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,240
the founder and ceo of solo

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,359
at so we are trying to make service much

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,400
easier to adopt

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,519
and operate uh focusing mainly on sdo

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,640
right now

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,760
nick so i'm nick jackson i work as a

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
developer advocate at

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,680
hashicorp and i'm also writing a book on

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,879
server smash patents with o'reilly

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,719
michael hi everybody my name is marco

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,360
i'm the co-founder and city of kong

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,800
kong is the creator of kong mesh and one

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,320
of the maintainers for

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,520
kuma lui

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,039
hi i'm louis ryan i work at google and i

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
spend a lot of time working on

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,800
istio and google's istio related

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,320
products

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,560
uh william hi i'm william morgan ceo of

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,560
buoyant i'm also one of the creators of

00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,360
linker d

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,640
excellent a lot of service mesh

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,840
knowledge here

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,000
so i would like to ask our panelists how

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,479
should a user decide

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:29,600
if they need service mesh

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,520
i start go ahead uh it did

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,960
yeah so like everything in life this is

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,560
a trade-off right i mean

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,079
there is a lot of advantage that service

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
meshes bring you to the table

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,360
specifically i think all of the service

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,040
mesh is

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,479
focusing on observability security as

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,680
well as routing

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
uh traffic and policy um so that's

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,960
bringing a lot of benefit though if what

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,280
you have is one application with two

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,119
microservices maybe it's an overkill

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,399
i think the trade-off is where people

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,439
need to play

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,439
um and if so you know it's did

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,040
the volume of microservices that you

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,799
have and

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
amount of application that you have

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,160
teamed up working with that

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,879
versus the you know the complexity of

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,040
operating one

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,440
michael anything to add i guess

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,319
perhaps uh another way to frame this

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,280
question

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,360
would be to ask ourselves when should

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,760
our application team

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
stop building and reinventing the wheel

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,200
when it comes to service connectivity

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
every time they create a new service or

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,000
every time they create a new application

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,879
service mesh is always been positioned

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,959
as

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
yet another thing that we have to do and

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,360
build and implement

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,879
and deploy but perhaps it is an

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,360
opportunity for us

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,120
to stop doing the hundreds of things

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
that the application teams are doing

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,000
every time

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,000
when they want to make a request over

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,640
the network or receive a request for the

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,280
network

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,360
the things that service mesh solves are

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,720
not things that we don't need without a

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,480
service mesh we still need them the

00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,319
security the observability

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,400
the difference is how do we implement it

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,239
and service mesh allows us to do it

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,640
from the infrastructure they're

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,760
forfeiting uh very precious time from

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,760
the application teams

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,599
i'll just chime in and say from you know

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,599
we help a lot of

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,040
organizations adopt linker d and

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,640
typically you know the

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,879
there's the value prop of the service

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,239
mentioned are you set up for this

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,319
and they are you set up for this

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
component is you know are you already

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,319
operating basically in kind of a cloud

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,560
native way like do you have a platform

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,959
team that owns the underlying platform

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
that

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,080
can take on the service mesh as part of

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,519
their responsibility

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
if you're not if you don't have that

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
then like you know that all the

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,360
technology in the world is not going to

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,519
help you

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
are you operating in a world where the

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,480
developers you know are able to own

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,840
their services

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,200
you know and build on top of the

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
platform without having to understand

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
every detail of the platform if you

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,480
don't have that

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,519
then like the technology is not going to

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,560
help you so there are some

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,239
organizational

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,760
prerequisites which is what we typically

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,760
look for first

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
before even having the conversation like

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
you know are we going to improve your

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,040
observability

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,040
you know or not

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,479
yeah these are really insights a nick

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,799
annoy i mean i

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,160
much agree with marco i think it's a

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,360
trade-off between

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,960
platform running a platform and and

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,199
actually having to write code

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,080
but i i do think that the the problem of

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,479
writing the code

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,759
isn't necessarily going to go away but

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,840
the the problem around

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
managing the platform will get easier as

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,840
tight good time goes on and

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,080
sort of the various vendors come to the

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,800
market which provide you with a managed

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,800
service mesh

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,440
louie anything to add yeah and i think

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,960
uh you know talking about platform and

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,120
platform management i think william and

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,479
nick and marco covered that pretty well

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,919
there's there's also the top-down

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,080
constraint right if you're in a

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,360
regulated industry

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,400
right and and you have to do zero trust

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,080
networking like things

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,880
you know your options are moderately

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,639
limited right

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,000
and they range from the open source to

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
the

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,759
eye watering the expensive commercial

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
solution um

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,600
so yeah i mean those those are the

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,520
things that often drive these decisions

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,199
outside the kind of core like are you

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,759
ready to engage with the value proper

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,919
mesh

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,440
is it meaningful to you yes or do you

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,000
need to kind of get to a different level

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
of maturity

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,120
yeah absolutely um the next question you

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,600
know i would like to know the answer to

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,680
from your perspective is service mesh

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,120
actually getting easier for

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,120
enterprise to adapt

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,759
william do you want to start off that

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,440
one it's getting easier

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,360
uh i guess you know it's

00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,240
it's not getting harder uh

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,000
i think you know for enterprises

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,560
especially there's like

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
you know kind of a new swath of vendors

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,960
and so like

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,639
some of the landscape becomes more

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,600
complicated and now your your

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,720
feature matrix you know has like 100

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
rows in it whereas

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,039
last year might have had 50 rows so i

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,319
think in some ways it gets a lot

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:22,160
it's getting more complicated um but

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,160
you know the tooling is being built up

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,720
so um yeah i think it's a little bit of

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,160
a mix honestly

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,000
yeah nick anything to show

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
no i pretty much would echo what william

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,560
just said yeah

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,240
cool eat it yeah so i think that it's

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,199
definitely getting easier but i think

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,199
we're just

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,639
scarfing the the surface of how can we

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,000
make it even easier

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,000
and i think right now starting to get to

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,759
the point that servicemen is becoming

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,800
getting to a maturity that is actually

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,880
can can be adopted

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,319
easier let's say but as i said i think

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
that there is way more stuff that we can

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,599
do in order to make it you know

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,199
build the tools easier the user

00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,840
experience easier

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,080
i you know i feed it better to the

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,639
organization who's going to run it

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,440
and etc so i think that as i said it is

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,919
getting easier

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,039
it's still hard so hopefully we will

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,240
work on it as a

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,400
community to make it simpler

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,639
yeah michael anything to add

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,280
and i'm a big believer of simplicity i

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,400
think simplicity is a feature

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,759
good documentation is a feature um you

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,400
know easier to adopt

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,599
is it easier for the platform teams to

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,919
deploy it

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,840
to the application teams it is it easier

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,880
for the application teams to write their

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,880
software

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,319
knowing that there is a service mesh so

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,039
i think there is two angles

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
to this question and service mesh is

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,680
certainly getting easier to use easier

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,039
to deploy

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,759
i guess that perhaps the industry can do

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,039
better

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,120
to educate the application teams on

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,400
how to operate with assumption that

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
there is a service mesh running in the

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,520
underlying

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,520
infrastructure

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,520
louis anything you want to add so i

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,199
you know i think that you know the

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,879
service mesh products that are out there

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,560
you know have gotten collectively better

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,479
at kind of day zero and day one

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,919
right so what you see now in enterprise

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,599
is you know

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,120
that day two operation stuff really

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,520
starting to dominate conversations at

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,560
least

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,280
certainly the ones that i have um you

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,759
know

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,960
if you ship four releases a year and the

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,120
the company has

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,879
you know the manpower to absorb one

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,399
update a year

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,080
um you know how are they supposed to

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,080
engage with the product you know what

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,800
are their costs to perform upgrade

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,800
you get lots of like you're seeing

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,640
growth in the number of managed

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,000
service mesh offerings right not just

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,760
installed offerings

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,600
in response to that i think um

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
so that you know the conversation has

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,560
shifted um

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,360
as you know the early adopters are now

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,040
into a little

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,040
bit later in their maturity cycle and

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,240
are dealing with those day two issues

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,920
and those are becoming known to you know

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,120
the the buying side of the market and so

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,560
they're asking the same questions in

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,360
rfcs and things like that

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,360
are these um so i think that's you know

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,279
there's still plenty of room for growth

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,760
i think to make it easier for

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,040
enterprises to adopt and maintain

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,880
because they're not they won't be

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,839
willing to engage if they don't feel

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,240
like they can maintain long term

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,720
totally but it's exciting you know we're

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,800
making at least getting them on board

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,640
easier um what is the current

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,360
state of service smash nick

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,160
anything you want to share i think it's

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,519
really good

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,600
i mean i think the so louis and marco

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
touched on this which is around

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,560
knowledge

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
so that the fact that the practitioner

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,920
can now

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,160
more easily find information on how do i

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,680
do x with product y

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,600
that makes a massive advancement in

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,959
successful use of the tool and the

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
adoption of the tool

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,240
and i think as time goes forward and

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,040
more and more people are creating

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,519
tutorials and videos

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,480
and blog posts and things like that then

00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,720
that kind of

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,880
community contribution of knowledge

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,839
really really helps

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,240
adoption of of service mesh i think it

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,079
can

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,240
always get better and i think it will

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,800
but i think right now it's you know it's

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,160
really good

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,000
it's definitely not something that you

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,720
question whether it's a production ready

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,760
technology anymore

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,880
that's awesome uh michael anything to

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,959
add

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,560
i agree with nick uh i think service

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,279
mesh is one of those things that five

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,320
years from now

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,120
looking back will feel inevitable i mean

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,800
we are distributing our applications we

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,640
are decoupling them so we can deploy

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,880
them faster you know in a highly

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,480
available way and the more services we

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,240
create the more applications we create

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,839
the more connections we create among all

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,880
of these moving parts

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,880
and it is impossible to think that any

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,920
organization can be successful with this

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,079
transformation

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,680
without having something in place at the

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,279
infrastructural level

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
that takes care of all of these

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,040
connections so that we don't have to

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,440
worry about them anymore

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,120
and uh and without a service mesh i

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,839
really cannot see

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,279
how that could be possibly successful

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,760
and lots of enterprise organizations

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,399
right now

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,680
and practitioners are seeing that and so

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,279
as the adoption of service mesh

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,720
increases which is increasing

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,720
service mesh products will get more

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,440
mature and we're going to hear more

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,560
and more success stories from them on

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,320
how they enabled

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,079
these transformations with service mesh

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,000
so it's a very interesting

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,680
very interesting times ahead of ahead of

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,800
us

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,440
yeah eat it anything to add yeah so i

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,720
think that

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,560
when we're looking about the current

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,760
state i think that

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,600
i think that if you're looking at the

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,200
roadmap it's most of those meshes

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,040
basically today everybody's talking

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,440
about make it boring right

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,360
i mean it's done the future are there

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
and now it's relatively boring

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,360
so i think this is a very interesting

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,880
time because that shows a huge maturity

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,639
in the market and definitely there is a

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,480
market fit right i mean that's why we

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,480
have this conference this is why we are

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,600
here talking about it obviously service

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,160
mesh has a

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,760
market fee i think that the interesting

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,920
thing that will come after it

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,880
which i'm personally extremely excited

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,920
about it is

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,760
how we can even put push the

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,760
boundary okay so now we have this great

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,639
platform that we all agree that should

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,560
be there

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,720
and i think everybody will agree in the

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,720
organization as marco said in like a

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,480
fibrous thing it's just going to become

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
part of this platform

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,279
i think that what's interesting is what

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,360
can you do with this right now you have

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
a platform how can you extend it how can

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,040
you make it more interesting and

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,360
customized to your own use case

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,839
um so i think that will be right now

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
probably what we as a ecosystem all of

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,920
us

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,839
is going to do right try to push the

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,360
boundaries and which is pretty exciting

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,959
so

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:54,000
yeah totally uh louis or william um

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,959
so i think there's a couple of things

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,959
you know along with the boring

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,720
that we did it just referred to it is

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:04,000
also kind of the platformization

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,839
right um that

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
service meshes will become a little bit

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,639
less about the features that they

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,399
ship and more about how easy it is to

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,560
enable that last mile of integration

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,279
that you know customers need

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
um you know that's a transformation that

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,000
takes time as

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,839
it will take as long as it took to build

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
service meshes i think actually

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,040
um so that's one trend the other trend i

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,480
think you see is

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,560
the platforms on which people are

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,959
deploying service meshes

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,959
are starting to now incorporate service

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,959
mesh features into those platforms

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,560
themselves right so there's the there's

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,839
the bottom up market validation

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,120
right um you know you see some of that

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,480
even in kubernetes right where

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,440
kubernetes has like

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,000
multi-cluster services now right there's

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,199
that value proposition is starting to

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
kind of sink down into the

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,600
infrastructure which just makes it even

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,360
more boring which

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
in my opinion is just good

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,399
yeah totally willing yeah i mean i can

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,240
only really speak to

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,600
the linker d perspective but you know

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,440
linker d was like

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
the first service mesh and the one that

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,760
introduced the tournament to the

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,680
lexicons and we've been

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,800
asked this question every year since

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,480
like 2016 or whatever like

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:19,760
the ancient days um for me

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,240
like i don't know i think the

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,160
linker d is in a it's in a particularly

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
uh kind of exciting state

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,600
you know even at this conference we have

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,959
uh you know end users talking about

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,000
using linker d for

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,639
scheduling coven 19 tests for their

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,480
students

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
you know or for doing rapid

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,920
experimentation at these big financial

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,720
institutions or for doing chaos

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,680
engineering or

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,000
adding fips 140 compliance and like it's

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,279
just

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,440
it's stuff that i never imagined

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,760
lingerie would be used for

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,920
and so that you know feels awesome you

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,279
know we're up for cncf graduation

00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,320
there's like a whole bunch of cool stuff

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,839
going on but

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,680
the thing that we keep coming back to i

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
think maybe to louie's point is that

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,680
ultimately you know service mesh is

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,199
going to kind of be absorbed you know

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,680
maybe this is what become boring means

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,839
it's going to

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,480
just be you know part of the ecosystem

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,320
whether we call it a special name or not

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,600
and so the things that are exciting you

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
know especially as we think towards the

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
future or what can we build

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,160
on top of this because we know that

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,560
building a big

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,399
cloud native application you know

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,440
subject to all the demands that we place

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,760
on software

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,360
today is a hard thing to do and service

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,279
mesh can solve one

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,040
you know critical part of that there's a

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,680
lot more that has to be done so to me

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,199
that's the

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,440
that's the kind of most exciting bit is

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,560
uh you know where do we go from here

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
what are we building on top of the

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,880
service mesh

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,000
yeah excellent i think this actually

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,759
meets uh nicely to our next question

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,800
what's next for your service mesh

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,800
project uh willing you won't start

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,720
that off uh we're just shutting it down

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,959
like we're done

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,880
no more service mesh now what's next for

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,759
us actually it is going to sound pretty

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,759
boring because

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,800
you know with the kind of concrete wrote

00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,279
an eye for linkeries

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,880
largely around policy features so over

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,480
the next couple of releases

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
um you know well i should say the

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,000
releases leading up to the most recent

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,040
one 2.10 have been heavily focused

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,360
on mtls and getting identity

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,320
you know wired all the way through and

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
then that's

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,399
all that has been in service of setting

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,399
us up to do policy

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,160
um and and tackle some of the like

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,240
difficult challenges that we know that

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,480
people have especially in multi-tenant

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,639
environments um so that is kind of like

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,199
the concrete answer i think

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,240
more generally what's next for linkery

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,839
is

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,839
we want to make it we have a sense as a

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,800
project that you know it has to be this

00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,639
platform on top

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,639
of which people build things so we

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,480
recently introduced this

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,240
idea of extensions which are very very

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,440
easy ways of plugging into linker d

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,880
we've already you know got some

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,440
interesting extensions built on top of

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,519
that

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,279
and to me i think that solves kind of

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,880
lingerie's core

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,560
uh vision here which is we want the

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,079
service mesh itself to be really small

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,279
and tightly contained but we want people

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,279
to build on top of it

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,199
and you know have kind of a modular

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,839
approach so that's what's on the road

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,079
map for

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,039
uh foreign excited to see how that

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,079
evolves over

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:12,000
the next six months or so that's great

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,000
marco do you want to tell us about cuba

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,799
so kuma comes out of the work and the

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:19,439
efforts that cong is doing

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,480
with our enterprise customers so it's

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,280
the fruit

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,880
of that work and you know service mesh

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,039
it is an important piece

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,640
of the broader connectivity puzzle of

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,720
how enterprise architects

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,400
are going to be providing connectivity

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,480
to their application teams

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
and when we built cuba we started with

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,000
that starting point

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,080
so we're going to be having teams that

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,440
are far away in their kubernetes journey

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,200
we're going to be having teams that are

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,000
not on kubernetes yet so how can we

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,480
provide

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
a connectivity layer that creates an

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,880
overlay and obstruction

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,400
across not only kubernetes but anything

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,160
including virtual machines that the

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
organization may be running

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,000
and we are obviously that's a very

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,799
complicated problem being able to run a

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,520
service mesh

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,559
in know multi-zone capacity upgrading it

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,960
making sure that

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,160
we always know if something goes wrong

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,480
where it goes wrong

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,919
so the operations of running a

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,280
multi-zone service mesh across

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,919
kubernetes and vms

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,120
across multiple clouds um you know the

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,280
easy upgrade

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,120
button that allows us to upgrade the

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
service mesh and the data plane proxies

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,960
that's

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,039
certainly something that i'm very

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,000
excited about um as well we've been

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,360
doing lots of work

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,120
when it comes to uh putting the

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,960
you know building a foundation for our

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,840
adaptive routing features that would

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,480
allow us

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,760
to uh improve the high availability of

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,600
our applications without

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,120
necessarily having to have human

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,640
intervention every time and the more

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,440
services the more applications the more

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,799
connections

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,480
and obviously the harder it's going to

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,919
be to be on top of all of this

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,679
and so the infrastructure at the end of

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,640
the day service mesh even

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,679
it's a mean to an end and that end is

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,480
reliability

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,960
security um and so we are working

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,679
towards

00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,440
automating all of that so we can remove

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,559
the human factor out of the equation

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,160
yeah nick um what about you i saw you

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,960
nodding your head

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
yeah i mean so predominantly i suppose

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
operational aspect

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,720
making it easier to operate is is one of

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,360
the key things we're going to continue

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,559
to

00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,799
um with hashicorp cloud

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,640
into different sort of clouds so you'll

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,679
you'll have managed console in

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,760
um in across more of the cloud vendors

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,520
in the coming coming year the the kind

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,520
of the operational aspect of

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,600
configuring multi-cluster capabilities

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,760
or for connecting sort of a kubernetes

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,160
workload of virtual machine

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,039
the operational elements of that is

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,200
going to be simpler

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,400
easier to kind of to manage the the sort

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,280
of security and

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,559
the actual elements of configuration um

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
and predominantly it's around the sort

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,039
of the kubernetes story as well

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,039
and delivering a really great experience

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:56,000
to a kubernetes practitioner so

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,640
you know treating things like the the

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,200
sort of

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,039
it should feel native that you're you're

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
just using an extension of kubernetes

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,679
and not a sort of a different product

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,480
those are those are some of the sort of

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
the goals that we

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,280
yeah makes sense uh louis anything you

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,799
want to share from my issue perspective

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,039
well i i guess i'll share two

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,360
perspectives right so with my istio had

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,240
on

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,760
like a lot of what nick just said plus

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
the day two operation stuff

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,000
around upgrades maintenance just life

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,280
cycle management istio has

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,880
lots of features um and so most of our

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,919
our future roadmap is kind of just

00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,600
incremental customer driven stuff

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,679
you know probably with a focus on

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,840
compliance and security things

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,600
um and with my google hat on right it's

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,520
it's you know enabling

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:48,240
how google's customers to you know

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,080
easily adopt and absorb service mesh you

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,799
know we recently launched a fully

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,679
managed

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,280
uh istio based solution for customers so

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
they they don't manage the control plane

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,760
aspects of istu anymore we do that for

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,960
them

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,760
um and yeah that's aligned with the

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,360
goals

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,360
around day two operations as well right

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,039
just to try and lighten the load for

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,280
people as much as we can

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,640
um so yeah and that that's that's the

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,400
line of the trend like nick just talked

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
about right hashicorp is gonna provide

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,039
i guess managed console connector

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,679
similar things um

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,240
yeah makes sense yeah absolutely yeah

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,480
eat it

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,760
anything you want to share from istio

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,400
glue mesh

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,880
of course yeah so i mean we i'm a little

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,480
bit

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,080
different because each of the people

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,240
who's talking here is basically very

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,159
associated to one project and you

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,400
read solo we're working mainly with seo

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,520
today but we started our journey a

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,720
little bit different we started

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,039
basically with envoy

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,480
that was the thing that we based on and

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,320
therefore the first thing that we built

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
was api gateway the second thing and

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,600
basically we built the building

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,919
platform right the building blocks to

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,960
create those this platform

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:55,200
so basically what what we

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,360
we have is basically hey is an api

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,320
gateway that build on top of android sec

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,600
and now is going to shift on top of sto

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,159
the second thing that we have is glue

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,440
mesh is basically helping to manage and

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,280
basically focus on the data operation

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,720
as well as very big focus on

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,799
multi-cluster and

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,840
basically managing a lot of instances of

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,320
seo

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,360
um and you know fall over between them

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,360
and so on

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,600
then the third thing that we're focusing

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,360
about is extending the mesh with web

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,200
assembly so this is something that we

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,240
worked very very hard and brought web

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,280
assembly hub

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,200
to the community and to our product

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,280
and the last one was developer portal

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,480
which is basically you know the next

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,840
in my opinion you know you know

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,720
uh make sense approach to basically

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,640
manage all of this

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,640
kind of like bring it to the developer

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,840
be able to expose all the api that's

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,880
running so this is the building block

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,480
that we have

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
and i think that now when we have this

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
platform right that it's all kind of

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,520
like

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,679
working specifically on sto and envoy

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,360
and we have the knowledge of doing sp on

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,799
and why again we are pushing the

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,240
boundaries so the next thing that we're

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:02,320
going to do is working on building on

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,120
top of it and we're going to have some

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,760
very crazy and awesome announcement very

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,360
soon

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,840
so yeah stay tuned that's excellent

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,799
these are all the questions i have i

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:17,840
would love to

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,840
