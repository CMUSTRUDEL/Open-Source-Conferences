hey everybody uh welcome to

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,080
servicemeshcon

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,520
2021 europe uh thank you so much for

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,160
joining us today

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,440
um so i am uh chris campbell and i was a

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,440
member of the program committee and

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,519
that's why i'm here talking to you today

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,480
uh and we'd all like to welcome you uh

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,960
to uh

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,480
to the conference today um and so i've

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,119
been working with this uh wonderful

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
group here

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,320
is alongside the the people from the

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
linux foundation to kind of put together

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,760
the program today

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
uh and so hopefully it's gonna be a a

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,880
great conference

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,399
uh i thought i'd start out today by

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,079
doing a little uh

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,040
sharing on my own experience with

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,160
service mesh and how it's uh kind of

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,920
come into my

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,920
come into my life um i was originally

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,520
more of an application developer i was

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,960
doing full stack and front-end

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,800
development

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,640
for many years and i was actually kind

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,000
of doing a lot of learning on my own at

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,840
home

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
trying out new tools new processes

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,239
things like that and i got

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,920
started using uh google app engine and

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,519
heroku a lot

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,600
and i really like those tools because

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:12,080
they made me feel so productive

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,439
i was so focused on my application and i

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,799
could kind of just

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,920
let the uh complexity of deployment

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,040
really get figured out by those tools

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
um but the disappointing thing is is i

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,600
would i would be so

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,040
productive when i was learning and

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,400
building on my own but then when i went

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,320
into the office

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,159
i had to start dealing with aws and ec2

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,920
and deploying to ec2 and there's all

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,960
these complexities that start coming

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,320
about

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,600
and docker really made those

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,520
uh problems seem solvable

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,880
right it really like planted the seed of

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,200
this idea as like

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,799
oh we could actually build something

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,720
like a heroku

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,479
like a google app engine but that i

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,399
could use in the enterprise

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,880
and that was super exciting and super

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,119
empowering uh because it's so

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,880
it's so nice as a software developer to

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,479
be able to have the right tool for the

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,680
job so you can feel so much more

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,840
productive

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,239
um uh docker really kind of entered my

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,959
life

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
and and switched me uh and actually wore

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,520
my docker shirt today as a kind of a

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,959
throwback

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,959
it's it moved my uh focus from the

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,480
application to solving this problem how

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,280
can we make it easier

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,840
for applications for developers to get

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,959
their

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,959
their software out there and

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,480
uh one of the things that really stuck

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,840
out to me was this feature in docker

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,840
called linking

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,200
and what it let you do is create an

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,120
alias from one container to another

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,360
such that you could uh kind of create

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
this communication channel between them

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,360
so you could say link a db container

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,879
into a web app container

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,720
and then the web app can just refer to

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,080
the db container as db

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,000
it doesn't need to know like ip

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,840
addresses or

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
you know or anything like that well it

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,200
would need another port still

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,879
um but it wouldn't have to know like

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,400
what address it was on the network

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,040
which was cool um so because up to that

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,720
point

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,640
uh well that what what that did is it

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,480
kind of planted this idea in my mind

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,840
because up to that point applications

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,280
always had to kind of mutate

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,800
the environment that they were deployed

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,239
in right we use config files or

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
environment variables to set the

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,560
connection strings for

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,920
for our our dependencies uh so you'd

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,480
have to say like oh the

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,920
database is at this address on this port

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,680
so it's either localhost when you're

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,920
doing development or maybe when you're

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,000
in

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
here to put in the cloud it's a dns name

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,480
or another ip address

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,280
an off box machine um and so you'd

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
always have to kind of

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,200
be able to mutate and this uh this

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,560
linking thing and now it didn't really

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,080
solve the problem but it just planted

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
this idea of

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,760
oh maybe instead of the application

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
always having to mutate

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,360
to the environment it's deployed in

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,879
maybe we can get it to the point where

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
the environment

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,959
can mutate uh to the application maybe

00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,599
the

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,879
infrastructure is where this problem can

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,200
be solved

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,400
and i think service mesh is particularly

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,239
well suited

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,319
to add these types of capabilities so

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,239
when i think of service mesh i think of

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:15,360
uh four verticals of connectivity

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,560
uh reliability observability and

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,799
security

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,160
and all four of those things as it you

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,280
know relates to

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,040
to network traffic um they're all things

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,000
that we can handle at the infrastructure

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,320
layer to make it

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,759
that much easier for developers to make

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,320
it that much easier

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,040
to build high quality high highly

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:37,120
reliable highly secure software

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,479
and i'm just so excited for what the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,880
future holds

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,000
for out for cloud native applications

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,720
and specifically how

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
the service mesh uh can be there to help

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
solve them

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
um so if we can switch back to my slides

00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,360
um

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,639
so yeah that's kind of a little bit

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,199
about me and my journey

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,040
um for today we're gonna be hearing from

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,880
some great speakers uh we're gonna be

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,280
hearing from the leaders of this

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,800
of the service mesh space which is great

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,280
i get to hear their vision

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,240
uh where their projects are going uh or

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,800
how they see

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,720
the space evolving we're also gonna hear

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,039
from a lot of uh

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,520
people building on top of service mesh

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,479
uh both for their applications at home

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,400
uh or in the office and then also uh a

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:22,160
lot of use cases for service mesh

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,080
in academia so we're gonna have a couple

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
talks um from people

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
uh that are using service mesh uh in

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,280
teaching

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,639
and for projects uh inside of the

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,360
academic world

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
so super excited for the the group of

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,080
people we have

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,440
speaking today to word cloud and see

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,919
what came out

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,759
i didn't do any like post editing on

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,479
this so some of these things are kind of

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,960
raw

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,400
so i apologize for that um you can see a

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,160
couple things that probably don't make a

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,840
lot of sense out of context

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
um but anyways i thought this would be a

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,759
kind of a neat sneak peek

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,960
into uh into what the content that we're

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,039
gonna see today

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,479
so uh service meshes is right there in

00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,840
the front perfect

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,479
means we're at least a little bit on

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,240
target uh we got linker d

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,360
istio envoy you know great sounds like

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,400
we're gonna be hearing quite a bit about

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,680
those things which is

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,800
awesome kubernetes uh vms and

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,639
multi-cluster

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
excited so we got some hybrid

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,039
environments potentially

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,319
and also a multi-cluster right it's

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,360
gonna have multiple kubernetes

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
environments

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,039
uh which is something my team's tackling

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,520
soon so that should be pretty cool

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,759
uh chaos right oh there's a lot we could

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,199
do for chaos testing and service mesh

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:36,720
i can i can see it uh monolithic apps

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,199
microservice architectures based service

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,639
mesh

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,080
that's awesome uh security posture

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,479
automatic mutual tls so a good

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,000
a good amount of content here today

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,960
which is this is already kind of getting

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,319
my uh uh mouth watering a little bit to

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,680
to hear what's going on here

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,240
so uh pretty exciting uh

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,199
category wise um so we definitely wanted

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,880
to get

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,560
a little bit of stuff that's like under

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
the hood and technical so we're going to

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,440
hear

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,319
about core development and security um

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,759
we're also going to hear about

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,080
performance we definitely are going to

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,160
be

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,759
i'm sure as more and more people are

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,120
adopting this in production

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
uh they're going to be more worried

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,280
about like what performance trade-offs

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,440
am i making with service mesh

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,720
um so we're going to hear about that uh

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,680
like i mentioned i'm excited about

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,840
multi-cluster

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,280
so we have like i think a lot of people

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,639
a lot of other people are as well

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,479
because we got a lot of talks on that

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,919
and it's definitely been kind of a

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,599
uh a buzzword in the in the communities

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,759
uh lately that i've seen

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,440
uh monitoring right it's key i think

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,199
it's probably one of the most important

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,720
pieces of service mesh is getting that

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,080
visibility into what's happening with

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,759
your applications

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,599
uh and then lastly we wanted to save a

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,520
lot of space for production use cases

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,599
right we have way more people

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
adopting service mesh and getting it

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,240
into production so i'm super excited to

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,840
hear

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,639
uh about more production use cases

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,759
uh lastly i have a few shout outs um i

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,560
want to say thank you

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
to uh lindsay and the rest of the linux

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,400
foundation they have been

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,599
critical in putting together uh the

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
conference today

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,800
um yeah i can i can probably stay safely

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
on behalf of the whole program committee

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,560
uh thank you to lindsay she really made

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,280

i'm sure there's a ton of people working

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,120
with her at the linux foundation so

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
thank you

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,640
that goes into

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,240
putting these conferences together um

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,440
especially in the times of code so

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,399
thank you so much to them i'd also like

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,519
to say

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,080
thank you to kong um it's critical that

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,040
we have

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,680
sponsorship for these uh conferences as

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,680
well

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,040
uh and thank you so much to kong for

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,680
stepping up and being the diamond

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:53,360
sponsor

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,720
for today's uh uh conference

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,959
uh and i think we're gonna hear from

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,279
them shortly i'll just leave with kind

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,080
of

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,040
one little uh parting thought um it's

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,519
been

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,200
a long journey i think uh getting uh

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,320
you know getting service mesh out there

00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,680
starting to unlock some of these

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,200
capabilities

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,600
and sometimes it can feel like we're

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,120
moving uh kind of slowly right i mean i

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
i think i have these first kinds of

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
thoughts and we're playing around with

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,959
the ideas of what we can do with

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,279
with side car containers and whatnot uh

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,440
like six years ago maybe now

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
so it kind of feels like it's going slow

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,440
sometimes but

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,680
uh i always remember the saying of

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,640
if you want to go fast go alone if you

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,880
want to go

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,000
far go together and i think we're gonna

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,959
make it pretty

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,600
far as a community uh so thank you

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,160
everyone

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,839
for joining us today i'm excited for

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,680
what the future holds

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,800
uh and i'm more excited about the

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,279
conversations that we're gonna have

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,600
today

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,880
um meeting with some like-minded people

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,760
trying to solve some of the same

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,240
problems

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,160
uh so i'll catch up with the rest of you

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,800
