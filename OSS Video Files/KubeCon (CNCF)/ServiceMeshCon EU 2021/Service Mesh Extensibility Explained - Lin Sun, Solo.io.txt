Service Mesh Extensibility Explained - Lin Sun, Solo.io

You love service mesh but may have found out you need to extend your service mesh, whether you want to enhance the sidecar proxy or the gateways or the mesh control plane or plugin in your certificate authority or external authorization system. We’ll explore various user cases and extension points a service mesh could provide to users, using Istio service mesh as an example. This is meant to be an intermediate-level talk for audiences who understand the basics of service mesh and would like to further leverage service mesh to the next level.
