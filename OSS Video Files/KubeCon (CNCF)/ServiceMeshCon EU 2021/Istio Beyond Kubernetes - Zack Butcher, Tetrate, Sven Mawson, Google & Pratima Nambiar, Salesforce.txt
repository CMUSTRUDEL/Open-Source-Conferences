Istio Beyond Kubernetes - Zack Butcher, Tetrate, Sven Mawson, Google & Pratima Nambiar, Salesforce

Istio can be used to build a service mesh spanning heterogeneous infrastructure. This presentation will describe three use cases that use Istio to power a mesh spanning a variety of infrastructures. We will start by covering two similar examples of Istio spanning kubernetes and VM infra (EKS-EC2 as well as EKS-on-prem), followed by the Salesforce Service Mesh that supports services running on bare metal, VMs and Kubernetes. We'll cover what those deployments achieve, and spend a lot of time describing how they work and the tradeoffs made to enable them.
