Kubernetes and Service Mesh Upgrade Automobile Company’s IT Infrastructure - Chaomeng Zhang, Huawei

Rapid business development brings a great challenge to automobile manufacturing company’s IT platforms. In this presentation, Chaomeng will share a practice of upgrading the traditional IT built microservice platform to cloud native infrastructure. That is gradually transforming the self-developed inner DNS plus ELB for service discovery and load balance, per VM nginx for inbound traffic management, metric, and access log, to Kubernetes and service mesh.

The practice solves the problems that every service request crosses too many heterogeneous middleware and proxies, and turns out to provide lightweight resource management, auto-scaling, canary, non-intrusive and transparent traffic management, security and observability on a consistent infrastructure, and thus improve ops efficiency, makes ops work simpler and easier.
