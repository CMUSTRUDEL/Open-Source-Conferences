Rapid Experimentation Simplified with Linkerd - Alexander Simon Jones, DevOps Institute Ambassador

The cloud engineering team of a multinational financial services corporation used Linkerd to introduce rapid experimentation.
It enabled them to create more resilient services and comparatively test changes. In this session, we'll explore how they did it and lessons learned.
With the proliferation of microservices architectures, developers need to rapidly set up prod-like dev environments locally.
Fortunately, local Kubernetes clusters to model high-scale, complex architecture within an enterprise are increasingly common.
This enables engineers to work with local abstractions of much larger systems.

Within this paradigm, service meshes also need representation locally as it has intrinsic differences to running a vanilla network layer within Kubernetes.
To speed up and ease experimentation, the service mesh must be simple and easy to use. A positive developer experience is key.
