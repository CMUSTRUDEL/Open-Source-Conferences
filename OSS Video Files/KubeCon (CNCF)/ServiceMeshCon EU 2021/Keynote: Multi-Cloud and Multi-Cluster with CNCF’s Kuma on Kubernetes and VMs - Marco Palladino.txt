Keynote: Multi-Cloud and Multi-Cluster with CNCF’s Kuma on Kubernetes and VMs - Marco Palladino, Co-Founder + CTO, Kong Inc.

Organizations are well on their way to adopting microservice architectures, and as a result applications have grown to become decoupled and distributed - with connections spanning across geographies, clouds, and even workload platforms. Establishing service mesh as a “Day-0” solution for every team and application allows these organizations to deliver, livecycle, and troubleshoot applications faster and at global scale.

In this talk, Marco Palladino, Kuma maintainer and Kong CTO, will introduce you to Kuma, an open-source service mesh built on top of Envoy and a CNCF project focused on delivering simplicity and scalability to every application.

We’ll cover:

    Kuma’s unique feature set designed for enterprise architects. 
    Give you a first look at Kuma’s unique multi zone deployment, including hybrid Kubernetes and VMs.
    Walk you through a short demo to see Kuma in action across multiple clusters and clouds.
