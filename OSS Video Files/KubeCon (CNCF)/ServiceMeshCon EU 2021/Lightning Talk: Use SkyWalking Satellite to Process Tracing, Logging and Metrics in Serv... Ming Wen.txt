Lightning Talk: Use SkyWalking Satellite to Process Tracing, Logging and Metrics in Service Mesh - Ming Wen, api7.ai

Observability has always been a thorny issue in service mesh. Users of the service mesh need multi-dimensional data such as logs, metrics, and tracing to analyze the problems they encounter. In traditional solutions, users need to deploy skywalking, Prometheus, and Elasticsearch to handle these issues respectively. In this topic sharing, Ming Wen will introduce the latest version of Skywalking 8.4 and the sub-project of skywalking satellite. Using these two open source projects will help users use a complete and unified solution to process all observable data under service mesh.
