Lightning Talk: The Hardest Part of Operating a Service Mesh: Envoy Proxy - Christian Posta, Solo.io

Operating a service mesh in production has some pragmatic complexities with some contributed by Envoy’s underlying powerful feature set. Requests flow over the data plane proxies which means this is an important piece of technology to understand how to operationalize, debug, tune, and observe. In this talk, we share our experience at Solo.io supporting customers on Envoy-based technology both at the edge and in a mesh and share lessons learned such as: * understand which telemetry signals to watch for config sync issues, CPU, and memory pressure * enabling access logging and enhancing it with dynamic metadata * debugging connectivity issues with Envoy logs, metrics * tuning for cloud environments with keep-alive settings Attendees will leave with a better confidence of running Envoy-based service meshes such as Istio, Consul, Kuma, and OpenServiceMesh in production.
