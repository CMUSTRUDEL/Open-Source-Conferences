Service Identity - The Key to Zero Trust with Service Mesh - Matthew Bates & Joshua Van Leeuwen, Jetstack

Service mesh provides first class support for service identity, foundational to identity-based, Zero Trust security that is now of growing interest and importance in the enterprise. In this talk, Matt and Josh will explain the concepts of service identity, such as SPIFFE, and illustrate through example how the various mesh technologies are architected, as well as how they implement the principles of service identity to provide seamless mTLS between workloads. The talk will help Platform and Security teams as they think about identity for workloads, how it's used within the mesh and beyond, and importantly, how this may can interoperate with enterprise PKI infrastructure.
