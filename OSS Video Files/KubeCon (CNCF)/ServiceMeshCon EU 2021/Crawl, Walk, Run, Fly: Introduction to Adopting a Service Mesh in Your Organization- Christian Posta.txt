Crawl, Walk, Run, Fly: Introduction to Adopting a Service Mesh in Your Organization - Christian Posta, Solo.io

Deciding whether or not to use a service mesh and understanding the value/complexity tradeoff is step one when exploring service-mesh technology. Christian Posta has been helping organizations adopt this technology as a practitioner and architect for the last three (or more) years and shares practical guidance for how to adopt a service mesh for your organization. We explore top use cases like security posture, network debugging, regulatory and compliance, imperfect cloud-apps, and overall modernization efforts with microservices architectures. This is meant to be an intro-level talk with the audience better understand whether and how to adopt a service mesh.
