Multi-Cluster Service Mesh With Istio - Zhonghu Xu, Huawei

In order to achieve high availability and scalability, more and more users are going to deploy applications across multiple clusters. Even these clusters are distributed in different regions, how could services discovery and communicate with each other become a big challenge for users. In this talk, Zhonghu will show you how Istio can handle this tricky issue for us. First, he will talk about the different kinds of multi-cluster models and what are the best scenarios they can address. Then, Zhonghu will illustrate the design philosophy of how Istio discovers services across clusters and how Istio simplifies service management. And at last, Zhonghu will conclude some points that can be improved in the future.
