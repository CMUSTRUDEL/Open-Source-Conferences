so hello and welcome to the end user

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,240
partner summit and this is a panel that

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,160
will try to center on strategy and

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,480
vision and how to best navigate and

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,559
contribute to the cloud native ecosystem

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,639
as an end user today we have an

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,279
incredible lineup of panelists from the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,480
cncf and toc leadership including chris

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,160
anishik liz rice and ricardo roja

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
this panel pretty much is hosted by

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,840
myself and cheryl

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,960
hyung and we are both leading the end

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,199
user community

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,840
which is a vendor nature group of more

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,079
than 140 organizations that you

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,239
use cloud native technologies to build

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,079
and distribute their services

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
just as a reminder we are moderating

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,600
this panel in zoom

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,280
with questions mainly from the end user

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,520
attendees

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
additionally we will aim to stream this

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
on youtube and linkedin and hopefully

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,960
we'll go live throughout the event

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
so if there's any questions please do

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,280
put them in the zoom chat

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,680
or you can raise your hand and ask it

00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,399
live

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,160
if you choose so before we dive into the

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,440
questions could i ask everyone to

that we'd like to

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,080
ask for our panelists again if you have

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,760
any questions for

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,160

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,440
members do ask them in the zoom and i'll

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,160
let you to kick start with the questions

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,879
cool hey folks so my name is cheryl hung

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
i think i know

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,800
most of you already but it is awesome to

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
see you all again

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
so i want to start off with a question

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
to chris

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,120
the end user community steers the growth

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
of the cloud native landscape

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
by integrating tools within their

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
organizations and providing feedback to

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,760
the projects

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,519
can you outline how the end user

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
community integrates with the wider

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,800
system

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,879
ecosystem including projects sigs and

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,040
the toc

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,000
sure um you know as i mentioned in my

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,080
kind of introduction

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,680
end users have been involved with cncf

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
uh since the beginning you know we

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
deliberately as we set up the

00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,920
organization

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,920
we kind of jokingly refer to there's

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,760
kind of three three pillars to the

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,599
you know you know circus we have at cncf

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,959
there's the traditional

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,720
um you know governing board which is

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,440
boring handles the business decisions

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,840
budget

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,120
we have the toc which uh liz and ricardo

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,640
are part of that kind of handles the

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,680
technical decisions and kind of the

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,800
final pillar

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,239
has been the end user community and

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,640
you know we deliberately wanted to make

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,239
sure that we were not an organization

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,000
you know driven by vendors and so when

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,680
we set up the end user community we

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,760
ensured that they would have a role in

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,239
different parts of the organization

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,840
initially they had a seat on the toc we

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
now have two end user reps

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
on on the toc representing end user uh

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,959
interests

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,760
uh and you know there's kind of multiple

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,519
ways uh end users get involved you know

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,519
sometimes they could simply just be you

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,120
know passive looking to kind of learn

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,720
you know from each other uh through

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,200
presentations that we do with the end

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,560
user

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,239
group uh you know whether it's learning

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,840
from another company how do they do

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,040
developer experience how do they you

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
know potentially roll out service

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,920
messages

00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
service meshes um other end users tend

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,200
to be a little bit more

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,159
um you know active and contributing

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
projects

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,120
for example um you know uh capital one

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,959
recently contributed cloud custodian and

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,280
cncf and for capital one they're

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,799
an organization that essentially is

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,560
going through their own transformation

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,479
right so they started out as a bank

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,079
uh you know outsourced a lot of their

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,359
engineering and services then they

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,120
decided wait a minute

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,639
we need to be a little bit more

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,160
progressive and actually own some of our

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,759
engineering and so they brought that

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
in-house and they started develop

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,000
software on their own open sourcing

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,320
things sharing

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,080
things uh to kind of modernize how their

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,600
uh you know bank was run and so

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,960
uh they just started to contributing

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
stuff and you know sharing their lessons

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,759
with the end user community we have

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
other organizations

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
you know like spotify which you know

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,040
have done similar things uh where

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,080
they've open source backstage

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
to cncf that kind of describes how

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,600
internally they've

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,120
done you know developer uh you know

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,479
experience and kind of managing all the

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
services internally and they've decided

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,800
to share that with the world to learn

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
from each other so i think there's

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,840
there's kind of multiple avenues for end

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,120
users to get involved with or you could

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,800
just simply be

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,639
a passive listener and just learn from

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
everyone but ideally you would

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
hopefully contribute some of your

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,039
lessons learned within your organization

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,960
but we essentially don't

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,560
uh discriminate in one form another we

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,039
allow end users from all different kind

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
of

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,160
walks in life and part of and wherever

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,440
they are as part of their cloud native

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,440
journey to to participate

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
that was an amazing introduction

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,440
actually thank you for sharing your

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,360
your vision of how the end users are

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,919
centered within the community

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
um maybe i could maybe just add a quick

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,240
um

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,759
um because we've seen increasing numbers

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,960
of projects coming from end user

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,280
organizations like

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,120
chris mention capital one spotify

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,360
there's several examples

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,479
and i think it's really indicative of

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
how

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,759
it there are still some problems to be

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,680
solved in making it really easy to

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
build and ship and deploy cloud native

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,639
applications you know a lot of the

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,400
pieces are in place but there are still

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,520
things that can be improved

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:02,400
and in many of these examples

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,840
end user organizations are the people

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,199
who are rubbing up against those

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,039
problems and they're in the best place

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,360
to innovate with those problems

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,120
um so it's really great to see you know

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,880
those problems being identified and

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,080
solutions being identified and brought

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,759
back to the community

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,840
it's really you know valuable input from

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,080
you know building above those kind of

00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,240
core components like kubernetes

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,440
to getting closer to the real problems

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,160
that developers are hitting day to day

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,080
yeah i think historically you know end

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,759
users have not really been involved with

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,120
you know a lot of open sourcing and so

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,560
on they were consumers and i think

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
especially in the last decade we've seen

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,400
that switch from

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,120
it's not only the the innovation is not

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,639
only coming from

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,319
the vendors it's coming from end users

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
hitting problems at scale

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,479
or with vendor solutions and they've

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,919
been a little bit more progressive

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,120
these days and sharing some of those

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,240
publicly you know i remember when i

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,560
started my career

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
banks like it was even impossible to do

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,360
stuff like almost outside the firewall

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,280
of the bank and now you're seeing

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,800
banks like bloomberg and others you know

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,479
fidelity you know capital one

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,160
sharing these things working in the open

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
so it's just kind of nice to see this

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
shift

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,960
uh happen in the industry yeah there was

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,639
uh

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,120
hey everyone priyanka here um

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,000
i mentioned this in one of my keynotes

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
at last year's

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
kubecon cloud native cons is we're

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,960
seeing this virtuous cycle of innovation

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,440
where

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,160
uh end users are coming in and being

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,960
welcomed

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,479
into uh the cloud native ecosystem

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,120
they're trying out our technologies

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,880
using them battle testing them and

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,599
push putting as much pressure as

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,440
possible and then finding areas where

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,680
they could bring something new and

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,759
that's where end user projects are born

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
then they donate those then they become

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,240
even a deeper part of the ecosystem

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,160
then they influence new product creation

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,639
from the vendors and so the cycle kind

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,800
of

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,800
goes in a really positive way and i

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,720
think being end user driven open source

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,840
at cncf has been

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,520
super useful for everyone involved

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,520
because of that virtuous cycle

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,479
these were actually great answers and

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,840
thank you for joining us priyanka

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,840
um great to have to have you as well

00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
here

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,800
now i would like to focus a bit more on

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,879
the role of the tocs and

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,240
how this can actually impact the growth

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,879
of the end user community and make it

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,759
easier for the

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,440
end user community to be to be involved

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,280
so i have a questions uh

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,279
more for felicia ricardo last um

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,200
year the toc is actually focused on

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,519
streamlining the sandbox entry process

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,279
for

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,039
the projects and now the qscs are

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:42,000
looking to revise the

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,360
incubation criteria and guidelines for

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,040
again the incubation projects

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
now would you be able to talk us through

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,279
some of the motivations behind

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,160
those changes and how exactly could

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,240
potentially

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,440
make it easier for the end users to

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,560
contribute back to the community

00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,000
yeah i i could start with this so

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,120
the sandbox is relatively new we've

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,880
probably had it now for

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,640
two or three years maybe three years but

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,240
uh it wasn't

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,240
part of the original um

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,560
the original model that we had but we

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,480
realized that there were

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,240
there was demand for a place for

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,680
experimentation and

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
projects where people wanted to

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
collaborate they didn't necessarily have

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,880
a home that they could

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:30,160
do that in and we wanted to be able to

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,440
offer that so the sandbox was really

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,320
always intended to be a space for

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:37,680
experimentation

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,320
and over time we kind of tweaked a bit

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,320
what the definition of sandbox really

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
means like how good does a project need

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
to be to get into the sandbox

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,240
the answer is actually the bar is really

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,880
very low but one of the things that we

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,640
did

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,160
trying to streamline the process was

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,839
clarify

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,760
what we're looking for in a sandbox

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,800
project and clarify the extent to which

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,800
it really is

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,920
experimental we're not really making any

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,880
claims at all about

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,720
how good a project something is if it's

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,800
in sandbox level

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,560
um but we we stream like that so we've

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
got a much more efficient process so

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,120
that if you do have a project

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,399
and you want it to sort of start

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,920
benefiting particularly from the

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,240
collaborative nature of

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,519
cncf sandbox projects don't get any

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,839
marketing

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,120
push but they do get a lot of the um

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,360
ability to well

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
they're neutrally owned for a start and

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,680
it's a good starting point to jump off

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,040
from into incubation

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,519
incubation has always been the really

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,079
hard bar to get past you have to be

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,760
you know demonstrably cloud native we do

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,600
a lot of due diligence around

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,200
um the governance of the project the

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,360
technology in the project

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:51,040
whether people are genuinely using it in

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,279
production cases incubation is still

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,880
not fully de-risked but we do expect a

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,720
project to be on a pretty

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,360
solid path and

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,079
we we're working on kind of streamlining

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,600
that

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,399
not to change the um the bar

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,160
the the definition will um essentially

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,800
remain the same

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,160
but some of the ways in which we go

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,839
about um

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,120
collecting that information for due

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,200
diligence we realized we could

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,760
rationalize that we're currently

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,200
uh getting lots of help from uh what are

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,480
currently called the sigs the special

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,600
interest groups they're going to be

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,680
renamed to uh

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,640
technology advisory groups just to avoid

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,000
confusion

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,760
um they're helping us with that due

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,839
diligence and we we kind of needed to

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,200
clarify more the boundaries between what

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
we're expecting

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,279
the the the sigs the tags to do and

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,079
what the toc uh needs in order to make

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,320
the judgment

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,839
and essentially just try and streamline

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
the efficiency of that process

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,240
make things much more sort of

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,600
straightforward so that a project

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,360
you know it does take there's a

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,600
significant amount of work goes into due

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,760
diligence so it is still going to take

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,720
weeks but we want to get it more into

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,160
the kind of

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,800
scope of a small number of months rather

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,839
than

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:11,360
a giant six month eight month process

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,639
um ricardo do you want to add anything

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
to that

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,920
yeah i think that that's a very good uh

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
description

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,720
uh one of the things that is very good

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,519
in this area is that uh

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,000
all this idea of sandbox incubation and

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,440
eventually

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,279
graduation gives a really good feeling

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,000
about the project to the end users as

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,839
well it's quite important to have the

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,760
as much as possible in in this kind of

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:37,440
heterogeneous environment with

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,600
many different projects doing different

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,560
things but to have some

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,320
some nice criteria where things move

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,279
towards this process and then

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,560
as an end user people can can just uh

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,079
rely a bit on this

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
there's a lot more things like the

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,560
technology radars where where

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,200
more feedback will be uh very useful

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,360
also for people to make their choices

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,120
but having this uh this bar that

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,519
projects have to go through and some

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,760
sort of strict uh criteria they have to

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,959
comply to it's it's quite useful for for

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,279
end users

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,399
i think it's it's a it's a work that is

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,959
really valuable for

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,959
for everyone

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,519
cool i'd love to ask ricardo actually a

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,279
little bit more about

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,440
your role in particular because you are

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,279
one of the end user representatives on

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,399
the toc

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,440
so we now have four out of 11 toc

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,079
members

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,639
from end user organizations like apple

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,440
and spotify and yourself from cern

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,800
so what do you see as your role and

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,639
responsibility

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,560
and maybe even you can talk about why

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,560
you were interested in being on the toc

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,000
yeah so i i think the the one one of the

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:52,320
interests of being the tlc is really to

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,560
help the community like we we get

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,680
every end user gets a lot back and uh

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,760
it's uh it's

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,120
kind of our responsibility also to give

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,839
as much as possible

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,279
uh back to the community i think the

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,760
responsibilities are

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,639
are similar to other members just the

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,000
point of view is

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:14,000
is kind of different we participate more

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:16,480
on the end user gatherings

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,800
and we hear what other people are our

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,880
requirements and what their feelings are

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,079
in the different areas and our role is

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,800
really to give

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:25,760
this input when when the the tlc has to

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,839
make decisions or

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,800
or do some sort of due diligence to help

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,959
out in this area because we we are more

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,240
probably closer to other end users and

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,240
have a good feeling of

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,560
what what what different projects are

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,880
capable and how people feel about them

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,120
one thing that i also had the motivation

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,600
to join the tuc is that because

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,199
we are kind of in the research side and

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
we've seen like we were talking about

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,680
how the community has been involved

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,920
evolving

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,000
one thing that also happens is that end

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,360
users get together themselves

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,279
if the like the mainstream requirements

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,240
are not

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,920
like enough for their needs and this

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,160
happens in the research community so we

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,279
formed this cncf

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,000
research user group where we try to

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,079
accommodate

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,519
uh more specific requirements from the

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,440
research community so

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:22,000
uh also one one idea is to to

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
make those requirements more visible uh

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
in in the

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,279
ecosystem because i think eventually

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,120
everyone will need them but maybe maybe

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,959
the research community can can be the

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:36,079
one that pushes them forward uh

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:38,000
first yeah i definitely agree that it's

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,399
really important to bring out the

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,680
viewpoints from the end users

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,880
and expose that to the toc so that you

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,639
get a different view

00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:48,079
of the problems that are coming direct

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,240
from end users

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,440
and the research user group that ricardo

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,120
you mentioned

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,639
is a great example of that and actually

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
ricardo also chairs

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,079
he's too modest to mention this but he

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,920
also chairs that group

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,279
um so i'm i'm really grateful for

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,320
everything that you do

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:07,120
ricardo for this community

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,440
thank you yeah but i i stress again that

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
this

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,279
is a the good thing is that it's really

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,399
a vibrant community where these things

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,000
happen

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,839
by themselves so the end user group

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,680
again the research is a group is a very

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,519
good example that just came up

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,880
out of cook con and people getting

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,839
together over lunch and

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,839
then forming this

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,800
i actually couldn't agree more it's

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,120
great to see so it's like such a good

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,560
representation of end users in the tocs

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,720
as well and in the community

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,759
so i'm definitely looking forward to to

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:42,160
see how far it actually gets us

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,519
um i've actually i have a question for

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,360
priyanka mainly i mean

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,279
actually she touched upon uh this

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,800
earlier during the

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:51,040
your keynote at kipcon and

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,360
cloudnativecon europe in 2020

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,759
you have one of the key messages have

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,440
has been inducer-driven open-source

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,800
now would you be able to expand a bit

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,519
more on that prank and

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,720
what do you think is the the nucleus of

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,240
the end user community and how it

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,600
actually can shape the overall ecosystem

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,160
yes absolutely so end user driven open

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,039
source

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,280
that is has truly become our

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,039
a line that we in this foundation

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,559
identify ourselves with

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,480
it's because of all that you have heard

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,400
right now right that um

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:28,160
by having um end users participating in

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,880
our technical oversight committee which

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
is truly

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:34,080
our uh you know a north star body and

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,559
having folks like ricardo participate in

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,559
it you bring in this new perspective

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,320
i think uh referring back to what chris

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,919
was saying this is a big

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:46,960
change from how things used to be um

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:50,160
by encouraging end users to be part of

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,480
our community and ecosystem not just as

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,360
consumers but evaluators

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
feedback givers by creators of

00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,520
technology

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:02,480
we've changed the way

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,400
open source has been innovating and not

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,080
to say this wasn't happening before

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
but of course there's been innovation

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,919
from all kinds of companies

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,919
but by a focus on uh end users i think

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,720
the cncf cloud native computing

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:19,520
foundation has institutionalized has

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,520
set in stone that these engagements with

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,679
end users will always happen

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,559
their point of view will always be front

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,520
and center

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,480
and that to my mind is end user driven

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,080
open source

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,760
it's actually very similar for any folks

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,760
here in the audience who've you know

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,160
tried their hand at startups and

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,880
uh product development the whole idea

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,799
right is

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,000
customer driven development or user

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,440
driven development

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,440
that's kind of what we're bringing to

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,039
open source with end user driven

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,039
open source here at cncf

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,880
nice stuff i mean i think i definitely

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,000
agree of course i definitely agree with

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,840
this viewpoint um liz

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,039
so let me direct the next question to

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,919
you

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,799
at the last kubecon cloud native con you

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,440
presented

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,520
some predictions from the tic and what

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
projects you were seeing coming out

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,440
and i believe you're doing the same

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,679
again for this set of keynotes

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,120
so maybe you can give us a bit of sneak

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,480
peek about what

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:22,880
you see is coming next

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,500
yeah so um i don't want to steal too

00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,880
much thunder from my own keynote but

00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:28,880
[Laughter]

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,480
but what i've what i've done with that

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,520
one is revisit those original

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
predictions

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
and um it's always a little bit hard to

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,120
tell whether

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,640
it kind of becomes self-fulfilling

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
because we've said we think this is

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,720
these are interesting areas

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,160
but we have seen projects particularly

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,960
in the sandbox

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,080
in all the five areas that we identified

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
last time

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,640
in particular around the whole developer

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,480
experience and operator experience

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,600
um side of things so um our toc

00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,600
colleague harry

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,280
is also going to be taking part of that

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,600
keynote and expanding a bit on

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,240
some of the interesting changes that

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,600
we're seeing in devex and opex

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,280
um and then we have got a few more um

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,280
thoughts around i mean i think those

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,840
those five areas we previously

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,799
um discussed it was kubernetes on the

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,400
edge it was

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,840
chaos engineering devex opex wasn't an

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,679
ebpf

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,679
and one more help me chris

00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,159
i believe it was chaos engineering oh

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,159
service mesh was the other one chaos i

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,200
said service mesh was the fifth one so i

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,520
think those are all

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,080
still areas where we're continuing to

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:42,799
see innovation and consolidation

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:46,400
um a couple of other things that we've

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,039
highlighted one is that

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,840
multi-cloud is real you know i remember

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,679
sort of

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,280
two or three years ago people saying oh

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,000
you know cluster

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,039
it was all about multi-cluster and it

00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,320
wasn't quite such a real thing back then

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,440
but now you know it is it is

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,760
you know it'd be really interesting to

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
get a show of hands from folks on this

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,320
call how many of you are actually

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,360
engaged in multi-cloud you know i think

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,679
um both in terms of multiple public

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,640
clouds but also the hybrid cloud split

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,039
between

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:23,280
um you know on-prem and public cloud

00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,400
we're seeing some real solutions related

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,679
to to that

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,799
and uh i i feel like that's become

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,799
um you know a real

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,919
area of interest and another one that i

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,039
remember is um

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,960
ai you know it's we're seeing

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,240
it makes a lot of sense that people are

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,400
using the cloud

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,600
they're renting cloud resources to do

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,760
machine learning

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,360
training and you know building their

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,360
models

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:52,559
because they need giant amounts of

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,360
compute resources to do that

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,919
so it's kind of inevitable that we're

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,880
going to see

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
more innovation making machine learning

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,480
and

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,440
ai solutions easier to manage

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,799
on the cloud and that feels like a whole

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,000
sort of

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,360
new quite big expansion area for

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,280
cloud native and i'd be really

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,240
interested to hear other people's

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,919
opinions on uh

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,000
you know on whether that's also

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,039
impacting on their lives

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:30,720
chris is saying evp obviously yeah

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,720
staring at your shirt um yeah

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,919
yeah i think i think uh the only thing i

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,120
would add to that

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,840
is seeing kubernetes used

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,679
as more as kind of like let's call it a

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,360
cross-cloud control plane and running

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,360
more workloads than are just containers

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,360
right you know kubernetes may have

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,720
started as uh purely focused on

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,960
containers but we're seeing it

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,640
you know stretch to running you know vms

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,400
ai based workloads

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,600
uh orchestrating cloud you know based

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
services i think you know people are

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,880
just finding it useful as uh

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,640
a a control plane that could handle you

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,600
know different types of workloads

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,760
because at the end of the day you're

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:09,840
orchestrating things across different

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,840
uh machines and services

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,559
one thing i can say i'm definitely

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,280
looking forward for the keynotes

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,080
tomorrow so

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
learning a bit more of these predictions

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,880
um

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,559
within the cloud native ecosystem we

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
actually have a question from our end

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,799
users and i'm gonna

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,400
read it out now so the question is

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,960
coming from sergio and he

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,760
is asking that now we are in an open

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,159
source

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,000
cold war where open source tech pioneers

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,400
like elasticsearch feel they need

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,559
to change the open source licenses how

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,120
is cncf mediating this conflict

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,880
what should we do as end users and what

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,240
we need to expect in the future

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,880
so would anyone like to get a question

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,440
i'll start first so you know one of the

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,600
premises of cncf was always to allow

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,440
uh permissive innovation right you know

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,919
we license all of our stuff

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,159
under uh apache you know 2.0 which

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,799
basically allows end users vendors

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
everyone to build innovative solutions

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,279
on top of

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,960
uh you know these wonderful projects

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,279
without worrying too much

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,760
um you know about any crazy licensed

00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,440
obligations outside of attribution so

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,120
that's always been kind of how we've uh

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,720
structured the organization and pushed

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,400
ourselves towards basically

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
uh permissive and permissionless

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,440
basically in innovation

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,360
um you know there's obviously some

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,200
vendors out there that um

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,279
you know have different uh attitudes and

00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,200
approaches uh to this based on whether

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,880
you know you know changes in business

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,000
models or you know however they're kind

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,919
of structured

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,039
i don't really see cncf as an

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,799
organization to kind of like

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,559
you know mediate these things you know

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,600
from our perspective we really want to

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,600
listen to

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
our end users and you know if our

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,240
vendors or end users have issue with

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,880
things we could always you know

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,799
collaborate

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,320
on potentially a solution to work around

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,200
these things but in general like i don't

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,720
really see

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,320
cncf as a mediator here these are

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,919
organizations making these

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,520
decisions based on you know business

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,840
needs or other influences

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,679
uh the only thing that uh on a personal

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,000
level bothers me is when you have

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,240
you know companies that essentially uh

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
free ride on the permissive commons you

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,760
know using a license like atp

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,360
or sorry apache and then changing to a

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,760
more restrictive license

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,039
that just personally uh pisses me off a

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,320
little bit because it does cause a

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,080
little consternation

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:20,720
uh in the ecosystem and it does cause

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,960
confusion when it comes to adoption

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,799
on the product side but in general uh

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,480
cncf's roles not to be a mediator we

00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,440
listen to our end users and vendors to

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,600
kind of work

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,520
um you know with uh you know what

00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,360
happens uh in the ecosystem so hopefully

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,559
that uh answers your question uh

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,600
sergio i could add in a a

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,320
very much echoing that sentiment i think

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,919
we have seen how successful this

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,760
organization has been

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,279
based on apache licenses you know

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,360
permissive licenses have allowed

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,600
such great innovation and such great

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,760
collaboration

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,360
and there are plenty of vendors vendors

00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,159
surrounding this ecosystem who are

00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,279
managing to build successful businesses

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,240
you know some of it open-sourced some of

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,240
it proprietary

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,799
it feels like the permissive licensing

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,679
at the heart of the core projects

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,440
feels to me like that's been part of the

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,279
reason for our success so i hope it

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,400
continues and i hope that the trend to

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:25,840
continuing with permissive licenses

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,840
continues for a long time to come

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,640
yeah thank you for checking this uh yeah

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,120
tough question

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,640
maybe maybe to add a bit to that is just

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,480
reinforced here is

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,039
i think the one worry here is that um

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,880
the communities themselves change uh

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:45,120
like like it was being said that

00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,039
this has been extremely successful in

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,679
not only making open source uh

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,919
uh popular but also some companies that

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
traditionally were not so keen on open

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,960
source actually changed their minds

00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:00,240
and have been uh highly participative

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,520
so yeah one of the worries that we kind

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:07,840
of go back in time a bit

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,840
so let's see how it continues

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,320
amazing so going next again if you have

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,720
any questions please

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,000
ask them otherwise i would like to move

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,000
with the next question which

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,600
focuses a bit more again on kubecon and

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,919
some of the main themes that we'd like

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,720
to

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,240
or we see emerging um so are there any

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,559
themes at the moment that you

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,000
see kind of highlighted or any talks

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,080
keynotes

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,080
that you'd recommend for our end users

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,640
to attend

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:42,640
um i can start that one off um

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,480
you know this kubecon cloud nativecon i

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,159
think is a manifestation

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,960
of all of that this community has done

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,080
together

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,360
in the last greater than one year we

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,679
have all of you all of us we

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,799
have worked through some incredible

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,840
challenges

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,000
we've had different geographical regions

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,640
experiencing

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,960
turmoil at different points of time and

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,799
right now

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,880
our hearts go out to what's happening in

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,360
india in brazil even in parts of canada

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,880
like

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,799
so many parts of the globe are still

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,200
suffering but what this

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,880
community has done is that it's kept

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,200
moving forward together

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
and that you see is the tagline for the

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,039
show

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,799
and it's very intentional because

00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,320
true i i touch on this a little bit in

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:32,559
my keynote tomorrow but

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:35,679
through this whole time cloud native has

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,679
come in the community has kept

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,799
shipping at a great pace don't know what

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,760
that says but

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,679
we have been productive um people have

00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,480
really come together and supported each

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,559
other i

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,240
you know if i'm feeling down i literally

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,320
just needed to go tweet and someone

00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,279
would reply and have encouraging words

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,679
have supported my

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,640
words and i've seen that happen not just

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,000
for me but for

00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:00,640
others with each other um and i think

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,080
we've been very resilient in this time

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,159
because we are

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,440
made of a global force we're so many

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,159
different kinds of people coming

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,240
together

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,080
and our mission is the same we want

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,399
cloud native to be ubiquitous

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,360
we're on this path of progress that is

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,399
paved by

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,600
our diversity by our resilience by our

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,279
solidarity

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,080
so you will see that reflected

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,679
everywhere in kubecon this whole week

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,279
uh one of the keynotes that's really

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,440
exciting is by

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,600
peloton and it's on the agenda you'll

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,440
see they talk about how they've

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,679
navigated through the pandemic

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,279
gone fully cloud native and all the cool

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,279
things that have happened for them

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,520
and they by the way are not an anomaly

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,600
there are so many companies out there

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,880
who've completely ramped up engineering

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,320
workforces

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:48,240
during the pandemic as every company has

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,520
become a digital company with like much

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,600
faster speed

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,559
and so many folks have doubled down on

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,039
cloud native

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,279
you'll see a lot of that in the various

00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:59,520
talks that

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,880
really cloud native has become the

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,919
building block

00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,480
of you the human experience in

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,320
the pandemic and i think that sets us up

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,200
for success in the future

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,919
uh as liz said there's so many areas

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,440
where we are

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,440
you know in the predictions that we're

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,720
going to be critical in

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,720
ai being a big one and aiml is taking a

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,039
bigger and bigger role in society just

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,240
because of all the information that we

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,080
have now so

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,480
you'll hear stories about all of that

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,039
and i think most of all you meet people

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,360
you'll

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,039
hang out with folks not quite the same

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,520
as in person but

00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,559
it is definitely i think a bigger crowd

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,559
like we just

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,919
have we have more than 25 000 people

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,520
attending the show

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,279
and you have lots of friends to make

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,000
lots of things to learn lots to give

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:50,960
back

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:54,000
and i hope you enjoy it

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,000
amazing and let me follow up on the last

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,279
line that you said priyanka about giving

00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,960
back so

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,640
what do you think are the best ways that

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,679
end users can get involved and

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,240
contribute back

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:04,880
to the ecosystem that might open up the

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,080
same to

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,960
liz ricardo chris for sure i mean

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,519
they're you end users you are the heart

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,919
and soul

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,440
of what we are doing we are building for

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,399
you for your success

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,799
so any minute you're able to spend with

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,760
us is a minute well spent and one that

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,720
we value

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,840
so the simplest thing enjoy the cube

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,000
cons show up

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,200
learn and take what you learn back to

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,480
your

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,159
organizations from there i mean i highly

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,080
encourage attending the maintainer

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,159
office hours learning from them

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,360
and getting plugged in on their point of

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,960
view uh

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,120
about a project that you care about um

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,960
as you get deeper more involved or if

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,279
you want some guidance as you get more

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:52,000
involved i highly highly recommend the

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,320
end user ecosystem that cheryl and katie

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,519
run

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,320
so effectively i think um

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,360
you know it's it's a great way to be in

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,600
a part of a community

00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
where it's everyone just it going

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,120
through very similar

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,679
on the same path to progress as you are

00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,240
and

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,840
you can have clear uh candid

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,919
conversations about what's working for

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,080
folks what's not working for folks

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
and uh i i've heard you know i was

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,640
actually reading this book about habit

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,360
making

00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,279
and uh in some ways we're all changing

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,840
our cultures and the way we

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,600
our old habits when we go cloud native

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,720
and one of the things the habit making

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,760
book said

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:32,799
was that the best way to ensure a habit

00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,840
sticks is to do it in a community

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,000
and this can be that community for you

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,760
your accountability buddies so come to

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,640
the end user ecosystem come to that

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,360
community

00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,320
and i think you will find uh that you

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,679
accelerate

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,559
your path to cloud native which

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,360
ultimately is to delight your end users

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,360
um i think you can take it as deep or as

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,880
light of a role as you want ricardo here

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,519
is a great example

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,720
uh of taking a deep role and you know

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,440
having a stance

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,159
giving feedback to projects but really

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,159
it's

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:08,000
whatever you can spare is more than

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,000
welcome and you are always welcome

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,840
amazing um liz ricardo chris

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,279
yeah i could add a couple of things and

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,480
so i think one thing when we talk about

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:18,159
contributions

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,679
particularly in the you know world of

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,440
open source it

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,039
definitely isn't all about code

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,000
contributions co-contributions are

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:27,360
wonderful

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,519
but as end users you're also having

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,640
experience of using these projects and

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,760
i'm sure that

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,080
every project out there is um very

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,399
keen to learn from your experiences and

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:41,200
you know things like raising issues

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,799
letting uh maintainers know about any

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,519
issues that you're having or

00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,240
scale problems or whatever you know

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,559
things good

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,600
or bad feedback on how the project is

00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,120
working for

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,159
for you in your real life situations is

00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,799
hugely valuable to existing project

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,799
maintainers

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,039
the other thing i would mention is the

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,120
what's currently called cncf sigs

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,599
they're going to be renamed to

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,960
technology advisory groups or tags um

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,639
those groups they kind of sit under the

00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,639
toc that ricardo and i

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:21,359
are on and they are specialist

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,679
you know areas of of knowledge and

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,720
experience and we lean on those

00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,399
groups for um advice to us

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,399
and also advice to that end user

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,200
community so if you have people in your

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:36,159
organizations who are really involved in

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,960
you know security or observability or

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,760
any of the

00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,879
there's i think seven altogether getting

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,599
involved with those groups

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,000
sharing your experience helping write

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,079
white

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,560
papers helping us understand where

00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,720
things are confusing to people

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,240
you know joining the community those are

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:55,040
really really valuable

00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,879
and yeah having having folks from end

00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,119
user organizations getting

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:03,839
more involved in those technology

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,839
advisory groups would be really valuable

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,400
i guess to kind of end the the thought

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,800
on

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,079
this one is you know of all the kind of

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,680
the companies i've worked with

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,280
on the end user side everyone has

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
different problems some are a little bit

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,359
more progressive than others and some

00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,119
are just like

00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:21,280
super early in the stage of their cloud

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,200
native journey and sometimes they just

00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,640
have simple questions like hey can you

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,480
go talk to our legal team to explain

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,839
open source or like hey you know how do

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,240
you potentially you know

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,440
contribute upstream without any you know

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,680
ip concerns

00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,119
we are happy to work with end users from

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,040
all different kind of uh

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,160
walks of life so don't be afraid to kind

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,000
of reach out to

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,400
um you know cncf staff to kind of help

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,880
guide you uh you know on on your journey

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,320
not everyone is as progressive as others

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,079
when it comes to

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,079
uh open source and cloud native

00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,359
okay i can just build on that then and

00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,000
just add

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:59,839
liz mentioned the six there are also the

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,320
end user groups

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:02,960
that people can can reach out to and uh

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,359
it's a very

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,440
good way to get introduced to other

00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:09,280
people using the same products

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,720
i think one thing liz mentioned which is

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,440
uh giving feedback to the project

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,440
themselves

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,440
it's critical this is something that

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,960
always has a

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,480
very good reaction from from the

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,640
projects themselves

00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,480
and then maybe i'll just mention also

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,560
this uh technology radars

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,839
uh that cncf runs often these are also

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,280
very valuable

00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,920
there are reports being published in

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,040
different areas regularly by cheryl and

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,040
cncf end user

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,160
end users so this is this is extremely

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,560
good

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,640
if you can provide feedback on those uh

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,560
it's always very welcome

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,839
and then in the in coop con i think it's

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,119
it's a very good

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,000
very good opportunity to to reach out to

00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,560
people

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,520
there's very relaxed sessions i remember

00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,680
in the last coup con

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,359
i think also katie and cheryl were there

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,000
we ended up in a session uh

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:00,800
learning how to juggle and uh chatting

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
with uh

00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:04,320
like random people and i know that uh

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,160
after that i at least

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,079
kept contact with two or three that uh

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,480
we followed up on on the things that we

00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,280
share

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,560
and we it's it's a very good way to be

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
introduced to the community as well

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,160
it's absolutely fantastic so many ways

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,440
to contribute as an end user so i hope

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,400
all of the attendees will make the best

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,800
use of these

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,480
these channels and these opportunities i

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,400
know we're kind of drawing close uh

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:30,480
to the end of our panel however we still

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,599
have one question from our end users and

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,440
this is directed to chris and

00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,200
it sounds like this chris have mentioned

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,040
that there would be more guidance from

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,640
the cncf on projects moving to

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,359
agpl like menio grafina labs etc

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:47,200
so agpl is not um it's not on the allow

00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,720
list for dependencies at the moment is

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,359
that correct to be able to expand on

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,359
this

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,200
yeah no i mean we have a very you know

00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,599
as i mentioned before cncf is all about

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,880
kind of

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,280
permissive uh innovation uh and so on so

00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,160
our allow list of licenses that projects

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,760
can depend on

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,560
are generally all permissive licenses

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,880
like mit other apache things bsdns

00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,960
so on uh agpl is definitely a more

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,480
restrictive license so it is not allowed

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,640
um as i mentioned before there's been a

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,800
trend in the industry to kind of change

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,320
uh you know let's call free writing on

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,160
the permissive commons and changing from

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,680
something like an apache agpl and so

00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,480
some of our projects are affected by

00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,960
this

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,040
we recently posted some guidance on the

00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,680
cncf foundation github repo for our

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,920
projects

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,200
uh that um we will be publicizing more

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,800
next week but we're all a little bit

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,000
busy at kubecon but if you're interested

00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,400
in kind of reading the

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,079
full details um that link i posted in

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,640
the chat uh from the foundation repo

00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,720
kind of gives

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,240
a set three recommendations of projects

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,480
uh what they could do it could be as

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,560
simple as uh using the old release

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,400
uh or getting together with partners and

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,760
peers in industry and maybe forking

00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,440
that you know that old release and

00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,480
maintaining it in open so

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,000
there's a different set of

00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,440
recommendations for folks and we plan to

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,960
talk it out talk about it more

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,960
uh after kubecon next week

00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,640
awesome thank you for responding to this

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,720
one um

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,680
so pretty much we're close to to the end

00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,680
of our panel

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,359
are there any other remarks any others

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,119
uh suggestions recommendations following

00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:12,400
users and how they can make the best of

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,640
kubecon

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,040
anyone from the panel would like to take

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,040
this one

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,400
um i just wanted to add one piece uh

00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:29,760
which is that in that spirit of

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,680
being a diverse um ecosystem of be

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,079
having diversity-powered resilience

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,800
we innovated on the kubecon cloud native

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,599
con

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,640
um schedule as well and two things that

00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,800
are new this time

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,960
are a business value subtract which has

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,359
a few talks around

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,119
literally cloud native 101 definitions

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,160
how to sell open source internally

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,000
things like that

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,520
so if you have colleagues in your

00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,359
company who you really think would

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,480
benefit from this and would make your

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,240
job easier

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,599
feel free to send them that way now if

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,480
they are coming into this part of the

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,320
ecosystem with

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,280
us and will support you in your journey

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,800
the second piece that we've added is for

00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,520
learners and students

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,319
uh around the world we've often heard

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,920
that

00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:15,520
uh even our 101 content can be advanced

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,000
for someone who

00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,560
um is a learner or a student and may not

00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,040
have

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,480
real time experience with a large

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,880
production system so

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,920
if you know anyone like that or on your

00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,640
teams or

00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,960
in your life uh please feel free to send

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,000
them

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,119
this way too because we want to start uh

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,200
supporting

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,920
that path to progress that people make

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:40,800
from as early as possible

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,319
and figured that a student subtract

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,920
would be valuable and if people want to

00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:45,680
find any of these sessions

00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,200
just go on the schedule and click on

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,079
student track or

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,520
business value and you will have access

00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,720
to talks that we recommend

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,560
for those experience levels so

00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:59,599
just thought i'd mention that since

00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,599
there's something cool for you

00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:05,200
oh and hallway track everybody should

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,040
hang out there all the time

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:09,200
there's a lot of fun stuff happening and

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,480
that is where you will hear when i'm

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,640
doing happy hours

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,040

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,920
after so join in we'll just be having

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,720

ricardo chris any last remarks

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,040
i think i would just say we really

00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,880
really do value

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,960
input from the end user community things

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,599
that are impacting you

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,200
um you know some of the things that have

00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,720
come up in the discussions earlier about

00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,079
things like licenses we you know we'd

00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,800
love to hear

00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,680
what the the real impact of this is uh

00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,960
for

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,960
you know for end users who are dealing

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,920
with stuff like that on the

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:58,319
you know on the coalface as it were so

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,839
uh

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,839

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,240
know you know

00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,319
give us feedback how we can improve

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,119
kubecon in this event we primarily put

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,119
on kubecon

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,359
for our end user community uh even

00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,040
though may not be obvious we do put a

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,800
lot of planning to make sure end users

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,560
are happy with it so please offer us

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,560
feedback and hopefully we'll be able to

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,520
all see each other physically and in los

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,599
angeles uh

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,880
in uh i guess that's four months or so

00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:33,760
from actually a little bit more than

00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,760
that in october

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,200
uh so uh other than that yeah give us

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,800
feedback we'd always want to improve and

00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,520
iterate on making kubecon a better

00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,359
experience

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,839
uh for all but hopefully this is my one

00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:45,520
of my last virtual

00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,079
events that is exactly what i was going

00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,200
to say

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:53,119
fingers crossed last virtual only event

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,079
um planned for uh la in october

00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,160
uh hopefully you know many regions

00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:00,400
around the world will be able to travel

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,440
um and i was just thinking as we were

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,119
talking here right

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:05,440
as we would say things it's like i have

00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,160
no idea if that landed with this

00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:09,040
audience

00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:10,720
do people think this is valuable or not

00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,000
it's like you know you don't know what

00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,920
the reaction is and i

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,119
i can't wait to be in a room with you

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,760
all where

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,880
we'll be talking rather than us

broadcasting

00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,000
to you so cannot wait mark your

uh but in person ones are even more so

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,800
i hope the next one will be when we get

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,640
attendees

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,319
at the indies of partner assignment and

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,800
all of your questions it was great to

00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:27,520
see

00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,359
what the actual end users are caring to

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,960
talk more about and explore

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:32,160
we are excited to see how the end users

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,680
are going to be shaping the future of

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:35,839
cloud native ecosystem

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:37,200
and more more than anything we're

00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,480
looking at how the industry community is

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,200
going to contribute back

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,240
and we're looking more um forward to to

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,760
those contributions as well

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,760
well i have one more thing to add as

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,480
well so if you want to learn a little
