again yeah cheryl

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,400
go forward please cool um

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,920
so ricardo i know you and i we've kind

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,240
of collaborated and worked together in a

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,400
few different ways now through cncf

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,320
um but it'd be great if you can tell us

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,960
a little bit more about your role

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
what you do within your team and

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,960
something a little bit about the

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,480
infrastructure

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,439
at cern yeah so yeah first of all thanks

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,840
for the invitation

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,880
is it i'm super excited to participate

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:31,840
in this

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,079
always happy to to tell people about

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,399
cern and our use cases

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,360
so i'm a computer engineer in the cern

00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,320
cloud team

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,160
i focus mostly on containerization and

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,960
networking aspects but also

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,079
on accelerators gpus and other types of

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,920
accelerators

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,600
and more recently i try to help our

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,559
users on machine learning

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,079
use cases so i've been here for a while

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,520
i had different roles but right now

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,280
that's what that's what i'm

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,239
doing mostly um we have a pretty large

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,559
infrastructure

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
i'm sure most people have heard of cern

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,799
but

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,920
we have we are a big particle physics

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,320
laboratory and we

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,439
we have a large scientific experiments

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,920
that

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,360
do cool things like accelerating protons

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,159
to close to the speed of light and

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,159
making them

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,159
collide at specific points and the

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,960
result of all of this it's a lot of data

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
and that's why we have to have a large

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,560
infrastructure

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,360
to process to store and process all this

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,680
data

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,640
we generate something like 70 petabytes

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,360
of data a year

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,439
we have more than half exabyte already

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,320
in-house

00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,840
so to analyze all of this we have a

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,119
large private cloud with

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,680
more than 300 000 cores uh and

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,799
we actually that's not enough for for

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,119
our requirements so

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
in the last 20 years we built a large

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,119
distributed computing infrastructure

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,079
that more than doubles that capacity and

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
this is done by

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,320
collaborating with uh more than 200

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,600
centers around the world that

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,159
that help us with our tasks

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,880
what was it that prompted the adoption

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,000
of cloud native

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,239
yeah so uh this has been um

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
we've been doing big data things for for

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,840
uh many years now so we are always

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,440
looking for the next uh thing that can

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,440
help us be more efficient and

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,160
basically process more events per second

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,599
which is our main measurement

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,680
and this is the main thing is that

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,959
we saw the potential to use this kind of

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,200
technologies to improve our

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,879
infrastructure and be more efficient and

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,560
this was in terms of simplifying our

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,040
infrastructure because we could just

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,319
rely

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,319
on a uniform api that

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,519
is declarative and kind of separates

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,720
well the workloads from the

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,200
infrastructure

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,480
and allows us to have our users just

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,480
telling us what they need

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,000
and then the infrastructure itself will

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,519
decide how to

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,280
replicate the services or the workloads

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,760
and also do things like cluster auto

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,840
scaling and the second one was the

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,120
the ecosystem around it we started the

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
kubernetes but there's

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,720
like a very rich ecosystem that will

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
handle things like logging

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,640
metrics alarming even so

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,840
this is it gives us a very consistent

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,040
set of tools to

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,440
to do all our tasks

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,680
and this this is also like very

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,280
important of course

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,319
maybe a third one would be i mentioned

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
this distributed computing

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,239
infrastructure

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,040
that needs to scale out and the fact

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,280
that the kubernetes api got so

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,239
popular it also means that there's a lot

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,040
of options for

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,799
people to deploy elsewhere and also

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,680
there's public cloud supporting it so we

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
can

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,040
like more easily integrate external

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,000
resources

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,599
into our systems and then instead of

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,280
focusing so much on the infrastructure

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,280
just focus more on the physics side

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
that's actually a very good introduction

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,439
of your infrastructure

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,560
um however you've mentioned before that

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,319
you manage more than

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
600 cluster at the moment you have

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,080
hundreds and thousands of nodes

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,920
would you be able to maybe deep dive a

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,360
bit more into some of the technical

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
challenges that you face of

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,599
managing infrastructure scale do you

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,519
have any challenges around like

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,040
access management networking storage

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,720
just some examples of

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,120
what exactly have to solve on a daily

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,479
basis yeah so

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,880
one one of the main reasons as well is

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,960
to

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,479
to have this kind of consistent

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,160
infrastructure where we do the

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,360
integration with our internal systems

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,199
once for everyone

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
this includes identity but it also

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,639
includes as you mentioned networking and

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,360
storage

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,560
the challenges are really like in some

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,240
they are very different

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,720
one of the main challenges is that we

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,639
have a huge variety of

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,360
use cases we have to cover so we have

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,240
the more traditional i.t services

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
that have to like the administrative

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,800
services and the things that

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,199
keep our campus going and this is kind

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,720
of

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,320
not something that we associate

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,199
necessarily with cern but actually we

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,919
have more than 10

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
000 physicists working here all the time

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,880
so

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,199
it's also a challenge to do that so we

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,680
have to focus on availability

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,639
and making sure that these services are

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,240
always up

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,080
and on the other hand we have to scale

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,320
out to do the physics analysis

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,840
so we need to like be able to distribute

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,320
the workloads really fast

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
and push a huge amount of workloads into

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,400
these clusters

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,639
so i would say that having clusters that

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
serve both use cases is the

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,240
is is a challenge we need to be able to

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
to configure the clusters very

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,639
differently depending on the

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,639
target in use cases

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,919
the technical challenges i think the

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,400
main one we have is

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
is managing upgrades that we've had for

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,520
for several years now

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,240
i would say the way we do this for the

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,759
application

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
uh the application upgrades and

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,720
deployments we we

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,919
promote githubs as much as possible and

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,960
to be able to deploy the um applications

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,639
in different clusters

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,639
and then we kind of promote also

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,680
clusters as cattle in

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,600
internally so that people if their

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,080
cluster breaks for whatever reason

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,680
uh they don't lose completely service

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
they might lose some capacity

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
and also they can easily do upgrades

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,280
into new clusters by just moving the

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,639
applications there so

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,800
i would say those are the two main areas

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,199
where managing many clusters for us is

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,960
kind of challenging

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,560
you've actually mentioned two main uh

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,319
very good areas i would like to maybe

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,280
ask a bit more questions the gitobs and

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
cluster as

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,000
a cattle now managing multiple clusters

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,759
there is usually the approach between

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,759
matching either multiple name name

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,560
spaces and distributing that to

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,960
different teams

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,440
or having multiple clusters would you be

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,039
able to maybe elaborate a bit more on

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,960
how you set up those clusters and what

00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,720
is the tools of choice to manage your

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,759
clusters overall

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
right so uh we we to deploy

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,440
we have two different types of

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,840
deployments uh one is uh

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,599
one big centrally managed cluster uh

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,639
which is using openshift

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,360
and this is uh doing isolation uh using

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
a

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,759
namespaces and and it's very well

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,840
centrally managed

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,440
uh and then we offer a service that is

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,680
more kubernetes as a service

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,680
uh where we build we we are able to

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,880
deploy kubernetes on top of our

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,919
uh lower level openstack deployment and

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,560
users can create their own clusters

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,520
using an api that we provide which

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,960
allows them

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,639
allows them to create the cluster but

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,880
also like scale

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,240
upgrades and delete the cluster so they

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,880
manage the world life cycle

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:36,960
like this and then on the layer above

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,560
the tools that we use for these clusters

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,160
maybe you mentioned this

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000
so we deploy kubernetes but we also

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
deploy alongside prometheus for

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
monitoring

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,960
fluency for the log collection

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,280
coordinates to manage the

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,240
logs like pretty standard stack i would

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,039
say

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,520
and then on top of that we promote a lot

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,599
people

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,720
using helm as much as possible to manage

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,440
their applications

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,319
and this is the like first step to for

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,440
the next level

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,479
uh git ups where then

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,280
we give internal tutorials and

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,720
seminars for disseminating these best

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,960
practices

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,080
so that they can use something like flux

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
or argo cd

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,240
to to manage uh the deployments in in

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,680
the multiple clusters

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,840
so it's kind of uh several step we from

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,039
the infrastructure we focus a lot on

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,360
on the making the clusters as

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,199
as reliable as possible and then

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,240
disseminating best practices so that the

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,080
end users can

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,839
can do the best for the applications

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,000
amazing that's actually a very nice

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,039
segue to developer experience and how

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
can we improve the

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,120
application deployment lifecycle because

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,920
i think uh there has been a lot of

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,600
thoughts about

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
how can we transition our engineers to

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,920
work with yaml maybe to work with like

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,560
templates like if you have customized or

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,640
helm

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,000
and now there's like a big movement in

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
shift where it's git ups and you've

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,880
mentioned already that

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,200
that is a practice which is already

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,440
enabled so would you be able to

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,040
maybe showcase um a bit more like

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,399
describe a bit more how exactly an

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,920
application is deployed

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
with git ups if you use any particular

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,440
tools specifically

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,959
and what kind of support you provide for

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,080
your developers

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,920
yeah so um i mentioned uh

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,360
this is this is not something new i

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,399
would say github so that

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,240
we've been doing similar things with the

00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,080
other configuration management systems

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
that we had like puppets or previously

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
we had other

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,160
others even with other types of version

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,519
control

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,320
and this is something that we are used

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,240
to um so one of the main motivations

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,640
here was to get

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,160
people interested in and on board them

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,920
into our kubernetes deployments

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,760
sometimes the learning curve can be kind

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,560
of uh hard

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,920
so if they can just go straight to to

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,839
the version control where they have a

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,480
bit of ammo describing how things should

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,040
look

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,240
and then build on that it actually kind

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,920
of puts traps their

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,160
their entry into the kubernetes world

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,920
so that was one motivation but then what

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,959
we try is to have a single source of

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
truth for

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,480
for all the application definitions and

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,040
this cover

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
covers uh the defaults for all the

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,839
environments that we have

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,160
but also allows to customize per

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:19,440
environment or per cluster

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,240
and we do this uh using uh we

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,480
we used mostly flux at the start there's

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,279
quite a few users now that also use argo

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,160
cd

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,680
so we don't mandate uh one of them uh

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,880
what we try to do is to

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,839
have people using either helm or

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,480
customize

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,920
as much as possible we have still a

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,079
couple of deployments that use plain

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,160
manifests

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,959
and that also works with the gate ops

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,120
but but it's not as customizable so we

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,560
we do a lot of internal training where

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,880
we

00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,399
advertise repos where we have like small

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:56,079
tutorials that show

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,079
how to use these tools internally

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,160
cool i wanted to ask a little bit more

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,279
ricardo about observability

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,440
because we did a cncf end user tech

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,720
radar on observability

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,399
in september 2020 and we kind of asked

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,200
people what observability tools are you

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,320
using

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,160
so obviously since you run 600 clusters

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,839
you must be observing those so can you

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,640
tell us about the tools that you're

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:25,519
using and the approach that you take

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,000
yeah so what we took an approach which

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,040
was

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,120
to try to build uh to integrate

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,240
with the existing infrastructure we

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,079
already have for

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,279
for other ways of deploying applications

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,279
so this was uh

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,399
crucial so that people can migrate their

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,920
workloads gradually

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,959
so our infrastructure for for collecting

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:49,040
logs and metrics uh already existed

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,279
and we have gateways where we can push

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,600
both logs and and metrics for logs we

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,160
use as a backend we use elasticsearch

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,440
for

00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,160
uh like short term um uh

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,800
log uh storage and query and then we

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,639
have an hdfs backend where we store

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,480
logs from longer term analysis um

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,639
for the metrics it's a similar situation

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:13,519
there's a gateway where we can push

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,920
the metrics and this will split into

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:20,079
multiple destinations which include

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,920
influx db and hdfs as well

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,279
when we started introducing kubernetes

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,440
then prometheus took a

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:30,720
huge role on it so we we are able to

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,920
push um the same metrics

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,279
types from from prometheus sources

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,120
into these gateways and they are

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,680
centrally collected so

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,440
one interesting part here is that we

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,639
offer our users two levels

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,839
of observability so in cluster they get

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,440
very fine-grained

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,800
uh metric collection and they are kept

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,480
for something like two weeks this is

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
configurable but on average i would say

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,720
two weeks and this allows us to like

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,760
debug

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,560
uh very recent problems in detail and

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,560
then

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,959
what we push centrally is an aggregation

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,000
of this metrics for more long-term

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,880
analysis as well we actually

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,880
do this using a standard prometheus

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,040
federation for now so the registration

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,800
of the cluster is still a manual step

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,480
but one of the things we are looking at

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,959
uh as we speak

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,760
is projects like thanos or cortex where

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,760
we could do

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,040
more dynamic registration of the

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
endpoints centrally

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,600
awesome i was actually about to ask if

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,160
you use anything like cortex or finance

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,000
to

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,680
to manage previous scale but seems like

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,560
it's already um

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
in your pipelines um the other thing i

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,519
wanted to mention

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,360
is that if any of the attendees have any

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,360
questions please to ask them we'll be

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
again monitoring them so we'll try to

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
ask them live um

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,920
if possible the other thing i wanted to

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,920
focus on

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,600
is that currently you seem to have and

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,199
solved multiple challenges across

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
different uh different stacks be it

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,040
infrastructure being

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,079
observability another aspect i'd like to

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,240
focus a bit more

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,120
is is the community because i know that

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
cern um

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,040
have been giving a lot of talks at past

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,839
kipcons and cloud native cons including

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,880
keynotes and uh actual sessions

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,959
throughout

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,440
and we're gonna have the kipcon europe

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:18,000
in uh may which is gonna be from may 4th

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,680
to 7th and there are going to be three

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,720
main talks delivered by certain

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,959
employees

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
um so the first two talks i would like

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,600
to focus about

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:28,160
uh the first one is going to be focused

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,480
on crds and operators and how this can

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,320
be

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,440
used to manage triple websites this is

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,160
going to be given by a colleague of

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,920
yours

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,279
so if you have any details about that

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
one i definitely would ask you to

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,160
elaborate

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,560
it more but the session that you'll be

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,560
actually delivering is going to be on

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,160
managing a centralized machine learning

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,160
platform using kickflow

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,079
now would you be able to maybe give a

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,000
short summary of these sessions and

00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:52,079
why coupon attendees should pretty much

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,959
sign up for for these talks

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,680
yeah yeah i'm happy to of course and uh

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,920
that's that's

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,800
i would say that's also one one of the

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,920
things that is

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,880
pretty special in this um usage we have

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,839
of cloud native

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,440
is that it kind of touches everything at

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,120
cern all the groups it's very common

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,600
that we use like an open source we are

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,160
very

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,120
much uh users of open source

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,199
technologies but

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,399
having a set of tools that is touching

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,959
so many groups uh

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:23,199
in our communities is kind of special

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,120
so like for for the talk from

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,560
constantinos and rajulia that we'll talk

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,680
about managing drupal

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,680
sites this is something that is quite

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,759
important at cern because the

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,360
dissemination and communication is very

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,959
important for us

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,000
we run tens of thousands of websites

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,759
some of them are extremely

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
visible like the home page of cern and

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,399
it runs in this infrastructure

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,480
so this uh what was developed is really

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,759
exploring an operator that will allow us

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,920
to not only deploy

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,360
a website but manage the life cycle of

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,000
these websites

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,600
so upgrades and backup restores things

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,759
like this so they will give a

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,040
pretty cool talk about this i hope i'm

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,519
sure

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,880
and then for the machine learning uh

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,959
this is uh

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,040
machine learning is really having a huge

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,079
impact at cern there's many groups

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,120
looking at it for

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,120
different areas there's use cases from

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,800
doing like particle classification in

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,040
the detectors to

00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:24,639
simulating generating simulation data

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,240
in a very fast pace um and also things

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
like reinforcement learning for beam

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,759
calibration things that i

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,120
i try to help but i don't completely

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,360
understand always

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,240
um so the idea here is really to help

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,800
our users

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,759
it's very common that groups will have

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,160
like one node

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,759
with one gpu or a couple gpus and they

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,399
can do their training

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,040
there but then if they want to scale out

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
they

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,600
don't necessarily have the

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,120
infrastructure or the knowledge to do

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,959
that so

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,199
we wanted to offer a service that will

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,399
help them out with this and also

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,560
if we start thinking that there are

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,120
multiple groups with these custom

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,079
deployments then the resource usage is

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,400
not

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,760
super efficient so we wanted also to

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,480
like bring everything together

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,439
so that we can improve uh like the

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,280
efficiency of

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,480
uh using resources that are kind of

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,000
scarce these days

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,319
like gpus and other accelerators so

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
we we try to offer a service that and we

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,600
will describe

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,319
how we do this that will manage the wall

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,720
life cycle

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,480
of their machine learning workloads uh

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,640
from preparation of the data

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,320
all the way to serving but also how we

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,120
integrate these types of different types

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,400
of resources

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,760
even like how integrate uh types of

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,960
accelerators we don't have

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:42,240
on premises like tpus ipu's and things

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:45,360
that we can we get from public clouds

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,080
i'm looking forward to to to like

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,679
talking to

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,520
people with similar requirements as well

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,200
after

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,480
that sounds like a great talk actually

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,120
like i think i need to build out my

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
schedule for keep going

00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,400
i'm sure there's plenty of other ones

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,640
like yeah it's always the problem with

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,320
so many talks indeed yeah but this one

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,160
is definitely a great one sounds like

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,760
a very good deep dive into how cube flow

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,919
can can be of help

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:14,000
to a real use case example cool

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,840
i mean something that i really

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,799
appreciate about you ricardo and about

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,120
cern is how

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,160
open you are to sharing what you've done

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,080
and what you know

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,440
with other companies and helping them on

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,080
their journeys

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,080
um i know you have another talk which is

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,320
about the cncf research user group

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,120
and you and i have collaborated within

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,320
this for

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,919
probably a year or two now so can you

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,480
tell us a little bit about

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,160
the cncf research user group and how you

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,400
got involved with it and what's your

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,880
experience been

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,559
definitely um yeah so i think that's one

00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,080
of the advantage of working at cern is

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,000
that we are we are able to be

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,400
really open and this is promoted about

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,600
what we do and we really want people to

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,400
to to learn more about our our main

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,880
mission

00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,600
but also how we do things uh so the

00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,640
research was

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,039
user group was actually came up uh

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
after a lunch break uh during coop con

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,840
barcelona

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,799
with bob killen and other people

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,160
together

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,880
and then we we thought of having a group

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,200
that would

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
be dedicated more to the more

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
research-oriented use cases

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,280
which are kind of different from the

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,200
more traditional ite service deployments

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,200
this includes things like uh patch

00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,160
managing park batch workloads having

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
queues and uh

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,480
and a way to do fair shares uh focusing

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,200
on accelerators

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,559
and then he talked to you and as usual

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,000
or as always

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,880
the response was a very positive and we

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,080
he kind of started this group and the

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,600
goal is really to get

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,200
together all these different

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,520
institutions uh and

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,360
academic institutions companies that

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,679
have these similar requirements

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,080
try to and like learn more from each

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,520
other

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,360
but also to document this this

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,880
use cases that we have and the solutions

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,520
that different people have and then

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,000
maybe give feedback to to the world

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,280
community

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,760
on how how the systems can be improved

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,400
to to serve these use cases so it's uh

00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,880
it's been

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,440
like really exciting to be part of it i

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,640
think

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,440
we have a pretty good momentum

00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,120
right now with a set of regular

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,039
attendees and

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,960
newcomers all the time so i think it's

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,720
it's quite exciting

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,240
it definitely is exciting i mean i

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,480
really enjoy learning about it

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,640
as you said we have this core group of

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,400
people who have the same use cases and

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
therefore run into the same challenges

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,320
just very openly sharing what they do

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,520
what they do

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,120
um and you know i want to mention also

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,559
that you are one of the co-chairs for

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,200
this group so you've really been a

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,200
leader

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,880
for this group and it's been fantastic

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,880
to see that

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,480
yeah and it's it's very interesting to

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
see and it really shows

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,640
another benefit of this cloud native

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,880
community is that

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
cern has this big data requirements for

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,240
many many years but

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
back like if we look 20 years ago we're

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
kind of by ourselves and now there's so

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,559
many people with similar requirements

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,520
so we can really benefit from from each

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,159
other and then

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,840
focus on like other aspects like more

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,440
physics related and not so much on the

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,720
infrastructure because there's so much

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,120
momentum in in here

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,600
so as katie mentioned it does seem like

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,080
you've solved a lot of challenges

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,120
but what do you see as future challenges

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,400
what's next

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,880
for you sen yeah so

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,440
we we have one internal challenge that

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,799
is pretty

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,559
big uh which is uh we have a big machine

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,159
and we generate lots of data but we are

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,039
about to have an upgrade in a couple of

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,320
years that will

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,400
multiply this by 10 and it's uh not

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,600
totally obvious how we can handle this

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,760
so we

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
we do as we always do we look around and

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,919
try to

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,320
to find solutions so we work together

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,120
with

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,320
everyone to try to to tackle these

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,159
challenges and

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,919
i think if we look at the integration

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,720
with cloud native technologies

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,440
uh the things i mentioned before uh like

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,480
supporting

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,600
batch workloads uh in a more advanced

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,720
way things like

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,640
queues doing fair share

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
on workload submissions this is very

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,120
important for us our systems

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,039
do this and if we manage to like

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,679
integrate this functionality

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,320
into the ecosystem then it will allow us

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
to

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,919
like have all the other benefits uh from

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,799
scaling out

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,000
uh integrating external resources in a

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,400
much easier way

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,120
coming together and then the second one

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,720
is again

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,520
we are moving a lot of our workloads

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,080
from cpus to gpus and our accelerators

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,120
so support for this type of

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,960
of resources is extremely important and

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,679
we have to be able to do this it's not

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,440
only

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,440
integrating resources but even like

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,240
virtualizing these resources so they can

00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,280
partition

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,280
and do better use of them i think this

00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,960
these are areas where we'll be focusing

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:05,120
quite a bit in the next couple of years

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,280
or a year at least fantastic

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,799
and i know that you are probably a

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,360
little bit unusual in the infrastructure

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,760
you run

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,640
but if you were giving some advice to

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,000
somebody today

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,799
about you know where to get started or

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,240
you know what advice would you give to

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:22,000
someone who's just getting started with

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,799
cloud native

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,760
and what you've learned yeah so i think

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:29,039
the

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,960
the experience we have from from doing

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,200
it internally is really to

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,320
to like the resources are plenty

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,679
to learn about the details and all the

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,320
the the tooling but

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,360
one important thing is to to focus on

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:48,000
doing transition

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,400
uh gradually uh we've seen internally

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,559
that

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,440
any kind of dramatic transition will

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,480
always be

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:58,159
very complicated so making sure that

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,200
all the integrations all the required

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,679
integrations are done properly first

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:08,480
sorry uh

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,159
and then uh and then gradually

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,159
transitioning the services to

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:14,960
to uh to the new infrastructure this is

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,840
something that is very very important to

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,840
to start slow outs area

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,159
since we touched upon the the community

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,720
i have another question of

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,559
cern's experience as an end user member

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,279
would you be able to maybe describe a

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,080
bit

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,679
how do you find the end user community

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,039
your engagement within it has it been

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,440
helpful for you to

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,799
either reach out to the other companies

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,120
within the same industry

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,000
um just kind of more a bit of how do you

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,120
find this

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,760
this experience overall yeah so that's

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,080
that's

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,720
i mentioned this earlier as well it's

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,640
one of the main benefits of

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,919
being part of the community and such a

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,320
huge community

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,039
is that a lot of the problems we had to

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,679
solve internally by ourselves are now

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,240
shared problems and it's extremely easy

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,600
to

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,039
to to approach

00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:11,600
other other end users

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,640
these days is more in in calls and

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,120
different groups

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,720
that are organized so joining the

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,679
special interest groups or

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,159
or the end user uh calls is is a good

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,960
way

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,760
or slack of course but one one thing

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,559
that

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,799
i really appreciate is also the the

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,600
conferences and the events where

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,559
uh it's like the direct content makes it

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,960
really easy to

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,919
to engage with other with other

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,799
communities

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,080
with other end user members and this

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,440
this we've we've had

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,480
several we've had follow-ups from from

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,039
like lunch or coffee breaks uh in in

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,760
in the conferences uh that turned into

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,279
like

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,159
full day uh sharing um

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,640
and exchanges um between members of the

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,840
different

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,159
institutions so this this has been like

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,159
great

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,120
you definitely make me miss the

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,400
in-person conference experience

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:13,919
and having copies and yeah

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,039
hopefully not too long i hope so

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,880
yeah definitely i can only echo that

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,679
like i so very much miss the coffee

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,480
chats during the

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,080
the networking sessions at kubecon

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,159
hopefully it's some time

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,760
soon uh another thing i wanted to

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,159
mention is um

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,400
recently you have been elected as a toc

00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,400
or technical oversight committee

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,520
so congratulations for for your new

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,279
positions um

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,360
would you be able to tell a bit more

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,480
about uh your responsibilities within

00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,799
this role

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
are you like any um are you excited

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,679
about this like how are you feeling

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:51,120
um being within this position

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,080
i'm i'm very excited uh it's it's been

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,120
i it's been a very like quick start

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,080
jumping in uh

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,919
but uh but i'm learning uh about all the

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,960
tasks and all the things to do

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,520
and um yeah so

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,240
it it's super interesting because i get

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,640
exposure

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:14,720
to to a much wider set of

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,159
of um like even projects and communities

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,960
that are part of the

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,159
cloud native ecosystem and not something

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,919
that i could uh

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,480
it's something i could do externally but

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,000
not necessarily i would have uh

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,559
all the time to to to focus on this uh

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,120
dedicate some time so really the task is

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,760
to to make sure that uh

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,360
all that is coming into the ecosystem uh

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,640
kind of integrates well together

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,360
and that we we are able to to offer and

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,279
especially in

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,279
in my case i'm as an end user

00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,559
representative i'm part of the toc as an

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,200
end user representative

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,799
to make sure that we we we take the

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,880
requirements of the end users into

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,720
account and not not just the

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,240
wishes from from the project of course

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,919
but try to match those

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,880
against the expectations of the end

00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:04,320
users uh it's very important that

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,440
that we have like a vibrant tech uh

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,679
um coming all the time but it's also

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,840
important that we don't keep uh

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
our end users uh that we keep our end

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,880
users happy

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,520
and not like constantly break uh um

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,159
systems um because there's a new one so

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,200
it's

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,799
it's really my role is really to to try

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:28,840
to give

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:31,120
an end user perspective into into these

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,279
decisions

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,480
that's so critical to have that end user

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,320
perspective

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,600
because i think there can be a lot of

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,200
discussions about

00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,039
what the right thing is to do but once

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,320
you have an end user who says i actually

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,399
have this problem

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,240
i see other companies who have this same

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,880
problem then that cuts through a lot of

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,679
that and

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,600
just keeps things moving um so that that

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,799
perspective is really really important

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,320
and it's something that

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,440
i think will grow over the coming years

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,080
yeah and it's it's really also one thing

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,600
that i

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,080
i um keep saying as well internally is

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,080
that

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,200
all the work that is done in the in the

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,520
toc

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,640
about evaluating the projects and even

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,039
giving them like a maturity level

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,640
is extremely helpful for for end users

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,679
because you know what to expect you know

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,640
what the criteria

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,240
is for for the different uh levels so

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,360
you can you can already approach a

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:26,799
project with some

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,600
some kind of assurance of what you can

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,600
expect about it

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,480
personally i'm definitely looking

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,399
forward to your contribution as a toc to

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,840
the entire ecosystem so

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:41,840
yeah it's going to be quite exciting

00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,640
um another question i have maybe to kind

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,720
of wrap it up um

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,240
since you are a tac representative and

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
cern is actually a very big

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,679
user of cloud native technologies i

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,200
would like to ask if there is

00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,080
any new projects or new maybe um

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,279
methodologies of um kind of practices on

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,480
the horizon on the cloud native

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,240
ecosystem that

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,520
um you'd like to use in the future or

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
something which maybe draws your

00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,399
attention

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,919
or your team's attention in particular

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,000
is there anything that you would

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,360
evidence so far

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,279
yeah so i i can give my a bit

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,799
my personal experience but also from

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,600
what i hear from my colleagues which is

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,559
maybe

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,480
also relevant which is uh one one

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,840
project that i i've been hearing about

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,960
is open telemetry

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,520
and uh how it aims to to offer

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,799
like a more consistent way to to handle

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,559
all the observability

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,159
parts and this is something that is

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,720
quite important we have

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,399
a good story for logging and metrics but

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,159
we probably don't have such a consistent

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,240
story for tracing so this is

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,840
something that some of our groups have

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,320
been focusing on

00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,520
and then personally because i work a lot

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,520
in this area

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,840
of distributing workloads across

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,600
multiple clouds and multiple clusters

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,880
one project that i've started looking

00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:01,039
recently is crossplane

00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:04,320
and i think it's uh it's a

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,880
really it's a nice way to integrate

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,200
again

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,080
uh existing infra infrastructure or

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
existing

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:14,640
uh uh services into the same

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,360
uh ecosystem and uh try to make again

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,320
the apis uniform and well managed in a

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,760
central place

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:23,440
so it's another project that i'm i'm

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,440
kind of excited about as well

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
absolutely especially with the the cross

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,240
plane i think there's going to be

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,039
a dedicated qualitative advantage or

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,200
keep going for it

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,240
so definitely looking forward to that

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,279
one as well

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,919
and we have actually a question from uh

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,360
germa and he's uh asking are you using

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,760
different public cloud providers to

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,519
deploy the whole infrastructure

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,360
there's communication between them so

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,320
would you be able to elaborate a bit

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,519
more on that

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,000
that's an excellent question so we are

00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,000
mostly

00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,039
on premises or using data centers that

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,960
are shared with us basically that the

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,320
institution other institutions make

00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,840
available for us we are investigating

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,440
the use of public cloud and we've been

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,519
doing this for quite a while we have

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,200
several use cases where we try to scale

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,000
out and we gave a keynote about this

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,360
where we managed

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,600
to reproduce the the higgs discovery

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,039
um in just a couple of minutes uh using

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,760
a public cloud resource

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,640
in that case google and we we keep we

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
keep pushing

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,399
in reality what we want is to do like

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,039
the most with

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,120
the resources we can access so we will

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,880
keep pushing for public clouds

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,640
the other question regarding

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,880
communication this is a very

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,039
very good question and i come again to

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,440
the fact that we don't have traditional

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,399
service workloads for most of what we

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:47,679
want to

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,919
scale out we we often say that our

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,399
workloads are embarrassing parallel

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,840
because we can just distribute them and

00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,039
they don't need to talk to each other

00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,720
and this allows us to actually

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,679
distribute them even across different

00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,760
clouds

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,960
uh in a much simpler way than if you

00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,640
would have to have uh

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,720
like very tight interconnectivity

00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,360
between the different systems

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,240
so we are able to scale out in this way

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,600
more easily

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,159
this is true for our traditional

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,399
workloads machine learning workloads are

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,720
posing new challenges because they often

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,720
need this sort of communication so

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,919
we are also investing in understanding

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,840
more

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,840
the service mesh area and how it could

00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,840
contribute to our deployments

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,679
i just want to mention that keynote at

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,519
clipcon that was an amazing keynote i do

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,919
remember it it was in barcelona as well

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,120
and it was a live demo where it used

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,039
like

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,240
an amazing amount of compute there like

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,000
within minutes so

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,840
i definitely recommend to watch that

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,240
keynote uh on youtube

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:48,240
um so

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,840
is there anything that you'd like to

00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,039
maybe

00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,120
evidence or maybe some um

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,120
uh talks you'd like to recommend for uh

00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,919
for our listeners too to go to during

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,840
kubecon

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,760
anything that uh maybe you'd like to

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,880
leave as last remarks in regards to

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,480
service and

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,720
it's a journey towards cloud native yeah

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,639
i honestly i didn't have time to go into

00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,879
detail into the schedule yet i plan to

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,280
do it very soon so but i'm sure

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,919
like the issue is really like to be able

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,280
to watch

00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:22,720
um all the talks even later it's very

00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,520
hard to find the time to go through all

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,639
of it

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,960
but uh i think the last message i would

00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,960
put here is um is that the

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,800
the community around cloud native is

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,919
having a huge contribution to

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,200
to our mission uh i mentioned that

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,040
yeah we have this mention of doing

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,839
fundamental research understanding

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,599
uh the universe better but this implies

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,159
a lot of technical challenges

00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,800
including i.t challenges and the fact

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:51,599
that we

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,359
can get so much help from from the world

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,079
community on all the institutions that

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,680
collaborate

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,320
uh in cloud native projects it's a it's

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,000
a huge

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,200
plus this changes the way we we work

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,520
compared to like 20 years ago again so

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,680
i would i would stress that message that

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:13,680
the the world community is is having a

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:16,880
huge impact in ourselves we try

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,800
in in our work we try to contribute

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,480
back but what we get is is much more

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,920
well i i want to say thank you to you

00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,359
ricardo actually because

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,599
i really admire how much you've

00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,079
contributed in all different ways

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
through

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,280
being a member of toc sharing what

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,440
cern's doing

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,480
and leading the research user group and

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,240
just being

00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,760
a really warm and welcoming part of our

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,920
community so

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,440
thank you for being there thank you

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,079
thank you both as well for

00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,760
for for helping out as well in all areas

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,760
and we actually have a very positive

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,480
comment from i'm trying to pronounce

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,160
that name right

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,440
uh ayayu but uh they are mentioning that

00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,760
the end user um and his perspective at

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,680
cern um and the support they've given to

00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,800
to the community has been amazing so

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,000
thank you very much for

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,400
mentioning that um

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,599
and with that i think we uh we're kind

00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,280
of getting towards the end of this
