2021 edition of the cncf

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
end user technology radar i'm really

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,200
excited to be here

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,759

with you the results from the cncf end

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,800
user community

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,519
so here we go

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,039
at cncf and my mission is to really help

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,960
end users

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
be successful as they're adopting

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
kubernetes

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,160
prometheus envoy and all of the other

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:43,200
open source cloud native tools

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,920
you can find me at my blog at

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,719
my blog oysher.com or on twitter at

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,719
oyshell

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,440
the cncf end user community is a group

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,920
of more than 140 companies

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,680
spanning some of the smallest most

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,399
innovative startups all the way up to

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,359
the biggest

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,720
global household names and these are the

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
companies that

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,920
are using cloud native technologies to

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,439
deliver

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:15,920
their applications and services

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,080
so without further ado let's go into the

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,200
technology radar

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,960
first of all let me please introduce the

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:29,040
february 2021 radar team

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,159
first off i have steve hi steve

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,240
hi uh so i introduce myself

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,280
briefly i'm a site reliability engineer

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
at rstudio

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,360
uh at our studio we're looking to we're

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,720
building out a

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,200
a cloud ide platform for data scientists

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,119
um and we're obviously doing so with as

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,159
many cloud-native technologies

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,600
as possible i'm looking to add more all

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,000
the time

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,200
nice good stuff and we have andrea

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,560
please introduce yourself hi terry hi

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
everyone

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,159
my name is andrea garbuzzera i'm an

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,600
engineer

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,840
and co-founder at old keys

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,840
altkeys is a company that is offering

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,920
authorization as a service in the cloud

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,000
i used to be an embedded engineer for

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,800
more than a decade

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,400
and then outkeys was my opportunity to

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,720
turn into cloud native aware

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,080
technologies

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,290
so at outkeys we really

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,360
consider

00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,239
[Music]

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,080
cloud native technologies as the future

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,440
that's the reason why we joined

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,640
cncf as end user and

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,879
that's one of the reason why uh hamir

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:53,040
participated at this radar team

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,040
fantastic and we have two more who were

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,160
part of the radar team but unfortunately

00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,480
couldn't join the

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,879
recording for today so i want to thank

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,840
them for their input and their hard work

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:05,760
on compiling this

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,879
radar

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,239
so first of all the topic

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,640
was secrets management andrea

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
why did you choose secrets management

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,440
for the topic

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
and tell me a little bit about what is

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,440
secrets management

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,120
okay um when we started with this

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,680
radar team task we had to choose a topic

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,879
uh many many of them were quite

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,200
interesting

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,480
but we ended up choosing a secret

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,920
management

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,159
uh especially because um

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,440
yeah from my point of view and from my

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,799
company point of view

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:48,159
uh security is uh

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,400
is a focus uh in our business

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,440
uh we are basically basically selling

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
authorization

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,480
in the cloud so we have to orchestrate a

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,200
lot of services

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,319
many of them are exposed and whenever

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,080
you have to

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,120
coordinate all these um services

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,760
uh you need to deal with how uh each of

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,799
them

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
uh authenticate with each other uh so

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,720
secrets

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,000
are at the base of this

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,880
of these mechanisms and

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,440
as soon as a company needs to automate

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,960
its

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,160
uh operation process uh it needs

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,840
to deal with how to store secrets

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
secrets management is basically

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,080
[Music]

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,680
the set of techniques that are used

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:43,680
for keeping those secrets

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:47,600
safe usually by storing them

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,120
somehow encrypt encrypted somewhere

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,840
uh but yeah we we choose to

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,440
to focus our radar on this topic because

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,960
it's not that easy as it

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:02,320
can appear at first glance

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:06,240
um so that's that's basically why we

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,880
we we at this uh this this decision to

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,639
do to focus on secrets management for

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
for the raider for this this month

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,280
rather

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,160
steve anything you want to add i don't

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,560
think so i think he did a great job

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,160
okay awesome all right so

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,479
still a reminder for what this

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,479
technology radar looks like

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,759
so the goal with the technology radar

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,960
was to

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,360
survey the end user community and ask

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,600
the

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
people as a community what do you

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
currently use

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
and recommend internally for your own

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,080
company

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,280
and there are three main options so

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,960
adopt meaning we clearly recommend it

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,840
we've run it we've used it for a long

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,720
time and it's pretty stable pretty

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,039
mature

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
trial meaning we've used it with some

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,080
success

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,280
so if you have a need for this then you

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,319
should be looking at this

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,400
tool or assess

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,360
meaning we've tried it out we think it's

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,360
promising

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,479
maybe it doesn't cover every use case or

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,680
maybe it's not quite

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,720
mature yet but you should consider it

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,400
anyway

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,919
and then there was a fourth option that

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,800
people could choose which was

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,400
hold hold meaning we don't use this

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,440
solution anymore

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,039
we recommend something else and then

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,360
the goal is to look across all of the

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,720
companies in the end user community

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:35,280
and put those tools into one of these

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:38,479
three categories

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,039
so this time let me start with steve

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,440
when you went into this what did you

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,800
expect

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,639
uh sure so i um i think my expectations

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,120
were potentially a little naive

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,960
in that i in looking at the space of

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,520
secrets management i

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,720
mainly expected organizations to be

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,360
using

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,319
the uh the offerings by the public cloud

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,440
that they were already

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,319
in it's it's obviously a much easier

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,639
a much easier choice to adopt just

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,360
essentially a separate set of apis from

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,039
the same

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,120
public cloud that you're already using

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,720
if you are embedded in a public cloud

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
if you're using a single public cloud

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,160
it's kind of a an easy choice

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,319
uh or at least in my view um it

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,360
it seems like a very easy choice uh to

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,479
just

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,960
adopt it you know a new small piece a

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,360
new

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,880
small service that is that is offered by

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
those clouds

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,080
is that what you're doing in our studio

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
uh

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,240
in in some way shape or form yes that's

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,039
at least one of the ways that we

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,520
uh that we manage uh secrets definitely

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,000
is

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,879
um as a small team it's kind of an easy

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,160
pickup

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,160
to uh to use an additional uh service

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,560
from a public cloud than to you know

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,479
kind of build out our own in-house tool

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,919
or um

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,720
uh or adopt a an additional tool that we

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,319
have to run

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,639
take care of maintain andrea what about

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,560
you

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:10,000
what did you expect speaking for myself

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,479
i really expected a lot of fragmentation

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,039
in this kind of survey uh

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,800
this is probably coming from a light

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,800
survey that we in the light

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
investigation that we did in the past

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,919
for uh for our company

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,319
on the topic so i'm not really surprised

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,000
that

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:31,440
we had very spread answers

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,560
and many many tools or frameworks that

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,919
have been named by by the people

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,120
participating to

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,760
to to the radar um another expectation

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,200
was that

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,800
uh in in this very fragmented landscape

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,320
uh we could have found anyway some uh

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,680
direction and that that's what

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:59,040
we ended up with we will see later

00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,080
yeah cool

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,120
okay so our next step was to

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,880
survey those the end user community and

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,160
ask them what were they using

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
for secrets management

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,640
we actually had a lot more answers

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,320
a lot more solutions than this as andre

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,440
you were saying

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
there were a lot there were a lot of

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,640
different frameworks here

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,120
um we ended up i think cutting off here

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,800
because we felt like there wasn't enough

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,800
data to really justify

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,519
kind of making a decision on it and also

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
if i remember correctly

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,959
aws was originally split into a couple

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,760
of different

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,760
options right

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,600
so um andrea or steve do you want to

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,839
talk about

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,839
why we ended up collapsing those

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,279
uh so i think that we were partially

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,399
motivated to collapse

00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:01,600
uh aws uh there were definitely more of

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,640
aws discrete secrets like services and

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,680
we collapsed them

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,399
in part because aws has made the choice

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,519
to

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:11,920
make each piece of secret management

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,040
uh a separate service in their in their

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,920
public cloud offering

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,560
and and it definitely skewed the the

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
results

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,079
uh since there was huge numbers of

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,120
adoption

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,440
um simply by virtue of it

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,399
not what anyone's service uh handles

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,399
each of the

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,519
each of the parts of secrets management

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,399
that uh that a

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,880
typical organization may want to use and

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,720
so

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,600
we had a lot of results where a single

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,640
company uh was using all of the aws

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,959
secrets services and and it ended up uh

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,320
ended up kind of skewing the vote count

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,600
towards

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,920
towards their offerings

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,920
yeah that's right so we did collapse

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,240
them just so that this wouldn't end up

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,399
being you know five or six different

00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,279
aws tools right so you can see from the

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
votes here um same as we saw on the last

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,120
slide

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:07,120
green means adopt the blue is kind of

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,760
trial yellow is assessed and then

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,560
gray is hold so these are the results

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,240
that we got from the end user community

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,680
and then our next step was to basically

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,279
decide from

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,040
these tools which ones did we think

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,360
overall the community would have

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,000
recommended as adopts or trial

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,279
and assess and

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,320
this is where we ended up landing

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:38,240
so steve or andrea do you want to

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
comment on this

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:47,680
um more than uh commenting on how this

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,320
uh happened to be uh distinguished

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,279
between

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,880
adopt and trial with which was kind of a

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,320
discussion in terms of

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,440
number of votes to to consider for uh

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,320
for the different categories uh

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,079
there's there's a point that this is not

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,839
possible to see from this table

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:11,360
uh there's there's a solution that

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,720
in reality is um probably in a

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,160
heterogeneous

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,360
set of solutions which is everything

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,720
homegrown there were some

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,480
some meaningful votes

00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,480
in the poll which were referring to

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,760
in-house solution for secrets management

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,839
we choose not to represent them in this

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:40,800
final result table because they are

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:44,320
definitely uh solutions which are

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,240
quite different from each other so um

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,480
we we ended up after a discussion

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,440
uh between the team uh that

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
it was necessary to to investigate

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
further if we wanted

00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,240
to expose which which of these

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,320
technologies were

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,519
kind of interesting for for others

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
potentially but

00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,440
when you when you have to do uh

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,360
when you come when you face a homemade

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,800
solution it's usually something that is

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,560
very difficult to

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,800
to use for others because they're very

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,839
usually tailored to to specific

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,399
situation

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,120
that's something i i i wanted to point

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,800
out because

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,279
it's not in the table but it was

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,079
something that came out from the poll

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
anyway so

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,360
um i can definitely add to that i think

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,200
um as we've kind of alluded to a handful

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,560
of times there was a really long tale

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,199
of tools that were used here and uh

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,279
that were reported as being in use um

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,079
and so while it's pretty obvious from

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,040
the votes

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,240
which uh which of these tools made sense

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,920
as adopt

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:56,079
uh the the remaining tool sets were

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,720
uh there was a little there was a little

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:02,079
less obviousness out of them

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,279
um mainly because the the tale was so

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,560
long and there were so many votes spread

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,600
across so many different

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,240
solutions that uh that there we kind of

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,560
had to use

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,440
a bit of judgment going down and where

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,480
to really stop

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:21,040
uh in this list um

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,040
okay great stuff so

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,880
this is what the final radar looks like

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,920
so in the

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,399
adopt section we had hashicorp vault aws

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:33,440
secrets manager certificate manager

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,560
and aws kms

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,040
in trial we had bitnami sealed secrets

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,360
and encrypted repositories

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,880
and in assess we ended up with gcp

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,320
secrets management and sobs

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,880
so next up i want to ask the radar team

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,920
from looking at the data that people

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,680
submitted

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,839
and from your own experience and what

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,560
you were expecting going into this

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,519
what did you find surprising or

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,680
interesting

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,760
or noteworthy themes to point out

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,680
so steve and andrea and the team put

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:10,839
together four themes for us and i'd like

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,880
us to talk a little bit about those

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,920
now

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,600
the first one is vault and the theme is

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,079
that vault has the broadest adoption

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,000
across

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:25,440
many companies and many industries

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,240
so steve why don't you start

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
of course uh so i can i can say uh

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,040
myself

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,360
and a handful of uh the radar members

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,680
were were very surprised

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
at the the the fact that there was such

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:39,440
widespread adoption of vault

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,839
uh not because it's not uh an extremely

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,519
useful tool but simply because it has a

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,240
pretty high cost of entry

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
um it's a uh it's it's operational

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,839
burden is

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,800
is generally uh much larger than some of

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,959
the other

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
uh some of the other tools on this list

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,880
um and so we were

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,240
i personally was pretty um pretty

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,240
confused to see this

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,680
uh but then when we start one we once we

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,160
started talking a little bit deeper

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,680
about it we started realizing that um

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
you know this makes this actually makes

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,639
a lot of sense

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,920
for one point it is it has an extremely

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,079
strong showing because

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,320
it does a lot of what the other tools do

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,920
but in a cloud agnostic way

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,800
if organization if organizations are

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,480
split across multiple cloud providers

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,399
if they have large footprints in

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:28,560
multiple clouds or on-prem

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,120
um vault is a is a pretty is a pretty

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,560
great tool in order to uh in order to

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,560
solve that problem because

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,800
it's comprehensive and it doesn't

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,920
require uh

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:41,920
uh any more lock any more vendor lock-in

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,000
uh in a particular public cloud and

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,240
obviously being able to be used

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,839
on-prem you know across multiple cloud

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,839
offerings without having to change

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,000
tactics

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:54,480
um we also uh we also kind of came

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
through with this idea that uh this

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,480
broader adoption really kind of makes

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,480
sense when you put it in the context of

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,600
offering it as an alternative to an

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,279
in-house solution

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,959
rather than everyone going off and

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,720
building their own secrets management

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,760
tool vault is a great

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,439
tool for uh that is very comprehensive

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,400
and is able to kind of

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,720
uh allow people to to simply adopt it

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
and

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:21,919
its uh set of of requirements

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,000
and uh rather than having to you know

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,000
go off and write a write a solution for

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,640
each new secret problem that they have

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,319
so

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,799
that uh can definitely lead to a higher

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,640
adoption rate and

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:37,360
that's great cool

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
okay in that case let's go on to the

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,480
second theme

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,559
andrea i'd like you to comment about

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,559
this one so after vault

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,000
organizations tended to use the native

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,120
solutions from their public

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,720
cloud provider yep

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:56,400
as steve already pointed out before

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,520
this this was something that we expected

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,960
when we choose the the topic for uh for

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,880
the raider

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,679
uh we we tried to to reason a little bit

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,520
around the

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:12,400
motivation for this and of course we

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,400
we ended up

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,160
considering that uh the cloud the

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
cloud providers uh native solutions are

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,919
usually

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,760
the closest to uh to the user

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,840
so they're the the definitely one of the

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,320
first choices if they

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,919
uh end up being uh covering the needs

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:41,360
that the user has they are probably

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,039
uh the fastest to to bring up

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:49,679
so this is something expected

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,760
uh anyway we also

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,919
took some time to discuss about these

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,520
results in terms of

00:18:53,919 --> 00:19:01,200
the potential lock-in effect that

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:04,320
it can it can have

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:07,520
on on a company decision

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,520
which of course is already

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,520
part of the choice of of cloud provider

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:19,360
uh yeah so probably

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,720
uh we ended up uh saying that

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,720
there are two different

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,280
type of organization those that are

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,000
split across different

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,320
cloud providers uh already considered

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,440
the

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,919
lock-in problem uh in-depth and they

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,919
probably ended up choosing uh

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:42,720
an agnostic tool for for uh for the

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,520
uh secret for these secret management

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,039
needs

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,840
um smaller companies which are uh

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:49,840
at their first

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,640
cloud native uh experiences are more

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:57,679
likely to stick with

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,799
the solution provided by by their their

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,440
their cloud providers so that's that's

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,720
what we

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,440
we put into evidence

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,960
um and what do you do at auth keys

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:14,159
because earth keys is pretty small right

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,240
yeah that's pretty small uh we we are

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,440
sticking with the

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,159
solution that are kind of naive in this

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,679
this uh in this scenario because the

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,360
team is very small

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:30,640
so uh secret security is uh

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,919
is is mostly managed by um

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,919
encrypted uh repositories encrypted that

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,960
data within repositories

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:43,120
we are not yet concerned about uh

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:45,980
sharing the content of repositories

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,679
across teams so

00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,080
[Music]

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,120
we are good enough for now but of course

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,840
we are looking

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,760
at more uh a structured solution for the

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,960
future because the problem will come up

00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,080
as soon as

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,480
uh the team grows and and

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,080
we have the need to give different

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,280
visibility to

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,320
to secrets to different different teams

00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,720
so

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,440
it's something we are working on so the

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,320
radar is

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,320
uh definitely a good opportunity to to

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,640
figure out what uh

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,520
what others that are bigger than us

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,960
already

00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,360
went through cool

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,360
thank you

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,320
okay yeah let's talk about certificate

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,360
manager because this one is

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,120
perhaps a little bit different steve

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,000
what do you think about certificate

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,000
manager becoming popular

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,039
uh so on this radar we you know we

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,720
noticed it popping up

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,159
popping up a lot and and it was

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,200
definitely surprising because it's

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,280
relatively new

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
and it uh it's not a general purpose

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,320
tool uh

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
or and it doesn't have like a general

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,679
purpose solution for many different

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,960
secret aspects

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,720
um but it is

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,080
uh one of the things that we kind of

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,120
that we kind of returned from this is

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,039
that because

00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,159
it has really tight integration with

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,880
kubernetes

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,640
um it it can not only be seen as an easy

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,000
quick pick up for those who are already

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,240
using kubernetes

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,200
um when it comes to managing

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,880
certificates

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,480
um but uh but also that uh it kind of

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,600
leads us to believe that certificate

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,679
management is

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,679
a really high concern it's top of mind

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,559
for those who are adopting kubernetes

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,799
and so

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,600
um that certificate manager kind of

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,760
comes along

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,440
uh in even though it is relatively new

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,000
because it's because it solves

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
a specific problem in a simple way um uh

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,679
for those that are using kubernetes it's

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,840
a

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,880
it's a it's a really it was a really

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,159
rapid and

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,159
easy choice for that ecosystem

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,640
okay let's go to our fourth theme

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,320
other solutions in the space are

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,720
fragmented across

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,480
various levels of maturity and

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,760
complexity

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:02,799
andrea over to you um

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:05,679
yep um yeah as mentioned

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,840
as mentioned before we we ended up with

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,200
very spread

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,200
data from the poll

00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,360
so this this was in part expected at

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,480
least uh

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,790
from my point of view but we also

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
considered that

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,640
[Music]

00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:27,520
some of this solution appear to be

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,520
a different level of maturity uh

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,880
complexity is of course another

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
aspect that is probably responsible for

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,400
uh

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,720
some company to to

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,080
to steer towards some solution instead

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,870
of others

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,440
uh so what we ended up

00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,200
[Music]

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,400
resuming uh on this uh on this aspect is

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,840
that uh

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,720
there is probably not not already a best

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,080
practice

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,880
uh for managing secrets this is probably

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,080
something that

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,200
can uh come up in the future because uh

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,120
secrets management

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:11,679
is not rocket science it's basically um

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:15,520
encryption and good practice in uh

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,400
in workflows so it's probably something

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,919
that is

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,559
in my opinion and i guess all the radar

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,279
team

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,080
also said uh something like this it's

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,370
going to

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,880
converge into more um

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:31,919
[Music]

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,039
more concrete uh best practices for the

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:34,960
future so

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,080
it's an ongoing process it's probably

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:40,880
something that is

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,880
it's it's not speedy uh at the moment

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,240
okay yeah thank you for that um steve or

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,120
andrea

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
any other thoughts comments takeaways

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:53,279
that you want to make on

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,279
your radar

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,880
i think so i think that's covered i

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,880
think we've been

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:07,279
okay excellent um

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,799
and then just one final question to you

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,600
so how did you actually find the

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,840
experience

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,840
of creating this radar

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,960
i let steve answer first

00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:24,320
[Laughter]

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,400
um i i enjoyed it uh i thought it was

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,000
um it was an interesting process to go

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,760
through it's it's interesting to

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,720
see that amongst cncf community members

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,000
uh there is a an inherent goal not to

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,039
reinvent the wheel

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,320
um and uh taking through that kind of

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,159
getting a chance to participate in the

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,440
radar and see that a lot of

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,960
a lot of different organizations of a

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,240
lot of different sizes are are

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,120
implementing

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,480
solutions around the same topic in the

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:53,440
same fashion or in

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,400
a handful of the same fashions um is

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,679
really promising

00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,720
and uh and being able to participate in

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,360
this kind of

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,120
uh and perpetuate that notion of of not

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,400
having to reinvent the wheel because

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,720
there are some

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,919
some tools that are ready and able to be

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,840
adopted by

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,960
uh by organizations looking to solve

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,760
these same problems this

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,760
has been really great

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,520
yeah i'm sharing steve's uh uh

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,799
[Music]

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,360
thinking uh and and i i couldn't have

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,640
said it

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,640
better i just want to to add that i

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:32,240
i'm very thankful thankful to cncf for

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
the opportunity to

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,080
participate in this in this task in this

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,720
radar
