00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,800
hello everyone

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:36,960
and welcome to the end user lounge where

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,040
we explore how cloud-native technologies

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
are adopted by end-user organizations

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,760
across different industries and sectors

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,320
just as a reminder the cncf end user

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,440
community is formed of more than 145

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,200
organizations

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,879
that use open source tooling to build

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,320
their services but they don't sell it so

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
the vendor neutrality is quite an

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,079
important characteristic for

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,520
for our community my name is katy

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,079
gamanche and currently i am the

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,559
ecosystem

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,559
advocate at cncf and i am leading and

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,159
representing the end user community

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
but at the same time making sure to

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
bridge the gap between the

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,760
end user the practitioners and the

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,760
project maintainers

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,840
these live streams as mentioned we aim

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,439
to bring end users to showcase their or

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,680
how their organizations navigate the

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,439
cloud native ecosystem and we'll try to

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,799
deliver these streams to you every first

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,840
thursday of the month

elevate the developer experience

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,119
using cloud native tooling before we

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,960
deep dive into some of the starting

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,160
questions jasmine would you be able to

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,360

delta airlines working

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,200
in the devops center of excellence had a

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,560
hand in implementing not only the

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,200
tooling that enabled

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,319
modern development but also our cloud

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,319
native journey

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,080
i'm so very delighted to be here i've

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,519
been a part of a lot of cncf

super excited to have you especially

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,640
that uh you have been pregnant in the

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,319
community for quite a while and now

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
you're one of the co-chairs for kubecon

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
and cloud nativecon north america

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
so we're going to deep dive into some of

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,640
those uh areas and topics as well

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,440
but before we do so um would you be able

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
to

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
maybe introduce some of your motivation

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,480
to become

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,319
a developer experience lead uh in your

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,200
past roles and in your current role

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,120
and could you maybe introduce what your

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
what your team's responsibilities are at

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,239
the moment

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,519
absolutely um so i kind of found myself

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,080
in this role by way of becoming

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,959
or being a quality engineer at the start

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
of my career

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,040
and a systems engineer when i

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
transitioned to delta

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,879
and historically all of my roles have

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
been supporting the software development

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,680
life cycle through writing

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,920
test automation providing infrastructure

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,280
automation to make it easy for deploying

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
um but never actually

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
software development so devops is where

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,640
i found myself

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,159
over the past few years and by having

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,480
you know a large interaction with

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,879
developers enabling them learning about

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
their

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,280
woes and pain points um there was always

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,040
a part of me like you know well we could

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280
leverage a lot of these automation

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,840
and a lot of uh the capabilities that

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,760
are out there to make their lives easier

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,959
um so during my time at delta we did

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,120
that through

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,199
a variety of you know capabilities

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,519
automation kubernetes implementing

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,560
the platform as a service and i really

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,320
loved um

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
kind of the ease that it provided right

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,600
um you didn't have to worry about so

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,680
many aspects of

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,440
deploying and it really changed

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,080
individual's life so it became a passion

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,759
of mine

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,919
um recently i found myself working

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
coming into twitter and leading the

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,080
developer experience pillar

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,040
the primary responsibilities of our

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,479
pillar

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
is to make sure that we're interacting

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,479
with customers

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,240
internal customers being engineers and

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,160
making sure that they're heard and

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
learning their pain points throughout

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,560
their development process so i work

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,639
closely with product management

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,800
to make sure we're talking to customers

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
um driving data

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
data gathering and making sure

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,440
prioritization of our internal projects

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,960
address uh the most impactful uh and

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,280
impactful ways to our

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,080
internal engineers so that could be

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
things like

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,840
making sure that uh our laptops are

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,000
performant that could be

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,360
things like making sure that we have

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,919
documentation in place

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,120
even something as simple as making sure

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,320
that they're supported while they're

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,840
using these tools

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,160
so those are the core responsibilities

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,919
of my pillar right now

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
that's actually quite insightful thank

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,280
you for sharing your uh your background

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,520
story because i think everyone has

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,520
such a different unique way to get into

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,800
using cloud native tools or being within

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,320
this community so

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,080
it's kind of for me personally it's

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,800
always interesting to to deep dive into

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,720
that

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,000
um now you've mentioned that the

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
developer experience at

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
twitter at moment is quite um kind of a

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,160
cornerstone or one of the

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,520
uh maybe the features that your team is

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,440
focusing quite heavily

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,280
now would you be able how this developer

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,319
experience actually shapes the way you

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,800
create and ship

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,319
ship your services like how what what is

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,840
actually the impact of having

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,639
a separate developer experience team

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,600
yeah absolutely um so developer

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,680
experience

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,520
at my current company is not something

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,240
new um but it's never

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,840
been a centralized focus area um and

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,520
what i mean by that there's always

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,120
feedback in the organization right

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,199
there's always people that

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,800
have you know they want to talk about

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759
the pain points what's going well that's

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,440
not going well

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
but sometimes those conversations are

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
held like within different

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,479
like ends of the organization and it's

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,960
not centralized um

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,479
so our focus is making sure that we're

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,880
talking to everyone

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,600
right and understanding the themes that

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,360
are preventing

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,280
a large part of the organizations from

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
being as productive as possible

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,479
um so we're taking this information

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
synthesizing

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,080
it and then gathering data to make sure

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,479
we're validating

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,840
the hypothesis of what the improvements

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
could be

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,759
so why is it a cornerstone i think that

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,680
by making sure all the development

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,280
community is heard and that we're

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,360
validating these things we can then

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,919
drive high priority high

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,440
impact projects that really make waves

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,639
within the organization and

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
and drive productivity gains now this is

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
really cool

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,840
and um actually being responsive to the

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,639
feedback within the organization i think

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,319
it's one of the main engines to drive

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,000
the product by the culture inside as

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,199
well and i would like to

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,479
maybe ask how you achieve

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,720
delivering this best developer

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,560
experience using cloud native tools and

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,919
what motivated your transition into

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,319
looking to cloud-native tools and

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:35,199
adopting them internally

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,960
yeah absolutely so um i have two very

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,919
different stories about this because um

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,319
between delta

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
and my current company twitter two very

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,080
different environments

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
so the first part of my journey um in

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,759
adopting cloud native tools

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,039
that was at delta of course and there

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,840
were events that

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,160
transpired that really made us think you

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,160
know

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
how are we going to make our

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,560
infrastructure more modern

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,879
um and become more agile essentially and

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,599
a large part of being more agile is

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,720
making sure

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,039
that you can move quickly right

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,720
and re-architect those services you go

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,639
from monolithic applications

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,160
to microservices so that the changes are

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,039
not so large and

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,840
disruptive to the environment um so a

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,599
large

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,240
part of the impedance of cloud native at

00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,440
delta was a new cio joining the company

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,840
um and he sparked the uh

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,120
just really the start of us start

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,080
working towards adopting

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,159
um kubernetes internally um first within

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,640
our local data center but then also

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,519
thinking about how we can flex within in

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,560
the public cloud

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,959
as well so making it easy for us to

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,839
if we need additional capacity right be

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,120
able to quickly

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,080
scale up certain components within our

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,920
environment and

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
application ecosystem so that way we

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:52,080
could have the capacity necessary to

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,399
serve that need

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,360
i think about you know even kovid last

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
year um

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,800
and i'm so happy that at delta you know

00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,920
we made that the start of the journey

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,480
before then because

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,320
you see how disruptive like that super

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,959
disruptive to the airline industry

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,320
the delta was able to adapt very quickly

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,880
and you know when it came to

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,000
implementing new applications to um

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,839
fulfill the coveted government

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,680
requirements all those things had we not

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,600
taken the steps that we did

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,440
and you know or have the framework in

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,680
place to even re-architect

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,440
real time it probably would have not

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,640
been as fast um or

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,200
successful of a adaptation so um

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,000
that was a large part of uh prompting

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,320
within the delta environment

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,600
at twitter however you know very

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,120
different environment

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:42,000
i was so surprised you know going into

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
such a very like mature organization um

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,279
work

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
using the best of the technologies that

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,320
are out there

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,839
for scale because the scale of twitter

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,959
is just so um

00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,680
it's so and it's very very large so it

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,440
was a very

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,279
um interesting to see how they were

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,720
leveraging it they're in very specific

00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,920
ways right for very specific

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,079
capabilities because

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,160
a large part of the platform needs to

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:06,079
scale quickly so they were using

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,360
the best of breed technologies to do

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,959
just that so

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
those are the two things i think that

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,760
prompted it within the different

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,560
environments

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,279
that's really cool actually and um now

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,279
that you've

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,720
adopted all kind of experience with

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,240
using cloud native internally

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,000
could you maybe share some of the the

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,519
current challenges that you're facing or

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,880
maybe something that you're looking

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,160
along the uh the way to solve as um as a

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,880
roadmap item or anything like that

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,079
yeah so i think that one of the biggest

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,000
challenges that

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,760
we're currently facing uh within the

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,519
current environment is just

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,279
making sure we're continuously reducing

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,600
that friction and that's a large part of

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,160
how

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,160
my team came about because there is a

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,240
lot of innovation that's happening at

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,120
twitter right we have to make sure that

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,880
we are constantly rethinking about how

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,240
either you know inputting new pieces

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,120
within the sdlc

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,279
could impact the uh the delivery of

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,079
value the speed of delivery of value

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,160
um so making sure that we're reducing

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,480
that friction in many ways

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,680
by having specific teams that are

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,680
dedicated to

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,440
those pieces so having a team focused on

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,440
deployment and improving that

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,360
consistently and constantly whereas a

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,399
lot of companies um have a team that is

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,519
focused on the entire

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,440
ci cd pipeline from source to deployment

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,519
right we are focused on those individual

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,200
pieces because once you get the depth of

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,800
knowledge you can then kind of iterate

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
and understand how you can improve the

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,680
different components

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
so i feel like that's a challenge but

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,760
we're continuing to address it in the

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,160
individual team space

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,200
there's a lot there's a huge breadth of

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,040
range of stacks

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,720
at twitter you know people are using a

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,560
lot of different things

00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,920
so one of the challenges that i i think

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,360
exists is how do we

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,160
make sure that we're abstracting a layer

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,959
away

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,160
so that when we do switch new stacks new

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,920
technologies

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,600
and bring them into our environment it's

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
not so disruptive it's still easy to

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,240
continue

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,839
to deliver and it's not something that

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,920
slows teams down

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
um whether it's for performance reasons

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,160
whether it's because you know there's a

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,680
new uh

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,600
better capability that we want to start

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,760
to leverage new features

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,959
it's make it as least least disruptive

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,160
as possible

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:16,399
um another uh thing a

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,360
challenge i think we have is just making

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,839
sure

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,760
that we continue to have customer

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,480
feedback on the new things we

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,800
implement we're in both the public and

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,920
um

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,040
private infrastructure spaces without

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,800
within twitter so

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,720
making sure that we're hearing customers

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,680
and acting on that feedback which is

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,120
my job so um it's challenging because

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,440
twitter organization is huge

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,560
and very opinionated which is great but

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,160
making sure we're bringing all that

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,720
together so that it's a holistic

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,480
experience for everyone

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,720
now this is actually quite really cool

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,360
because i'm actually looking forward to

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
see what

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,120
your predictions are for some of the the

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,920
themes um when it comes to cloud nature

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,519
technologies and if these actually

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,800
fulfill the challenges or help you to

00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,519
solve the challenges that you currently

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,519
have

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,040
now before i move forward with those

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,639
questions i would like to remind

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,000
everyone that if you have any questions

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
for jasmine please put them

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,600
in the chat of the platform of your

00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,000
choice that you're currently watching us

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,600
be

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,720
twitch youtube linkedin or periscope so

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,959
looking forward to the

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,399
the questions from the audience as well

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,000
um i have some

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,440
two more questions on the developer

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,920
experience and one of them

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,200
is how would you define a good developer

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,639
experience and if you have any

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,079
guidelines for someone who would like to

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,920
maybe improve

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,440
the way they interact or collect

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
feedback or action or feedback

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,600
do you have any guidelines around that

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,760
or maybe some standards or resources you

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,600
could share forever

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,639
yeah absolutely um so in my experience

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,440
a good developer experience um

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,320
has a few different sort of attributes

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,680
it's seamless

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:54,079
um when i say seamless i mean that

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,160
it's very fluid and it's easy for

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,279
changes to go through the process

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,560
with little to no manual intervention

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,680
in some of the environments that i've

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,360
worked in it's not been a huge

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,800
possibility just because of

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,480
the infrastructure types we're dealing

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
with or just the technology so it's not

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,560
always

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,800
feasible to get to 100 of automation

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,399
or have a fully seamless but to aim for

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,680
that i think is a great developer

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,519
experience

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,120
and on that same token like automation

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,600
absolutely like automate

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,920
everything that you can all of the

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,320
mundane activities that developers have

00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,600
to

00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,639
do over and over like find ways to make

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
it easy

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,560
so that they can worry about those um

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,600
other problems that they have to solve

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,000
daily or from an

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,920
architecture structuring perspective um

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,120
so things like certificate

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,600
applying certificates within the

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,360
environment very mundane activity

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,880
you have to do it yearly sometimes more

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,240
often depending on your security

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,600
requirements so automating that and

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,600
making it easier

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,680
for developers to focus on the delivery

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,160
of that value i think is a great place

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,560
to be for developer experience

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,440
another thing i think is important is to

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,560
reduce the

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,079
amount of waiting um so in most

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
environments that i've worked in there's

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,800
always

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,720
some component of waiting whether it's a

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,600
human human you're waiting for for

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,839
approval

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,360
or maybe it's capacity constraints that

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,199
don't allow you to move as quickly as

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,279
you want from a build perspective

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,920
but making sure you have infrastructure

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,760
or processes in place to make sure that

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,160
people are not waiting very long periods

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,680
of time because with that comes you know

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,120
kind of context switching right so

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,600
usually a person will go do something

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,880
else

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
and then come back and have to kind of

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,800
get started and there's um you know

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
they're not the momentum is sort of gone

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,680
at that point so minimal amount of

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
waiting

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,839
um and lastly and this is probably a

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,440
huge one of my favorite and uh

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,279
most important things i think you can do

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,600
is make everything that you can

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,600
self-service right developers um

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,639
want to have capabilities that they can

00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,079
go do

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,399
real-time in the moment and get things

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,399
done

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,160
quickly so they're all really related

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,680
now that i say them

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,440
and they kind of feed into each other

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,440
but i think those are all

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800
great components of a good developer

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
experience um

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,560
as far as guidelines i think that

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,839
there's a lot

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,519
of industry like companies that are

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,480
doing great things for developer

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,480
experience

00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,480
um dedicating teams like twitter has

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,600
done by hiring me and allowing you to

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,639
build a team within

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,839
our company um but making sure that you

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,959
have a

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,360
pulse on the organization however you do

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,040
that

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,880
just make sure you have a pulse some

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,480
companies choose to do surveys

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,000
some companies choose to make sure

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,240
they're having customer

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,160
advisory boards or even quarterly

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
business reviews with leadership

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,839
i'm just making sure that you're tapping

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
into all levels of the organization and

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,480
understanding what's important to them

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,680
um what is making the most impact um to

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
their productivity

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,759
and then working with them to solve that

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,639
um whether that's a dedicated team of

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,480
engineers

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,560
because the team that's the team is

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,480
doing work doesn't have time to explore

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,399
on the hypothesis but just making sure

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,920
that you're actioning on it um

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,920
you can learn all you want but if you're

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,160
not actioning and prioritizing

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,959
those customer um feed that customer

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,600
feedback

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,400
it's all kind of uh it's not it's not a

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,839
great place to be

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:11,280
so i couldn't agree more to be honest

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,799
um and thank you for sharing all of

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,079
these uh the good pointers one thing

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,360
that you've mentioned before and i would

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,439
like maybe to expand on this you've

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,360
mentioned the documentation internally

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,120
now do you have any maybe advices how

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,959
can we create this a synchronous

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,720
communication channel that is

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,760
effective and efficient at the same time

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,320
yeah so my documentation channel um

00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,799
when when just solutioning for features

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,440
or

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,880
defining new processes what aspect

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,240
actually both of them because i think

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
when it comes to developer experience

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,799
like one of the things is like how do

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,640
you consume a feature so

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,640
is it me going to a different person or

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,679
is it me maybe having a wiki page

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,679
internally which will

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,880
provide all of the right information so

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,640
do you have anything in place

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,080
now or again do you have any guidelines

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,559
on this one

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,320
yeah yeah absolutely and um this has

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,400
become very important given the

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,080
distributed nature that we're all

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
in right now everyone's distributed

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,760
right now

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
but i think at twitter especially

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
asynchronous communication is very

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,360
important

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,360
we took the step of becoming a disper

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,280
like globally dispersed company

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,400
so it's very i'm high priority first to

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,039
make sure information

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,840
is easy to find and also um readable

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,919
right and

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,960
it actually has impact on on what you're

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,600
trying to do

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,039
um so i think that what you can do

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,160
within your organization to make this

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,360
something that um

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,760
is is helpful for your

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,120
users of your features or people that

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,559
are working with your tooling

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,960
i'm just making sure that as you're

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,760
developing the documentation is a part

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,240
of the definition of done and making

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,280
sure

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,200
that not only are you continuing to

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,679
maintain that documentation as you

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,240
iterate

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,320
on the product but also make sure that

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,760
even outside of iteration on the product

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,840
go through it make sure that from the

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,760
customer perspective it still makes

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,280
sense based on the use cases that your

00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,840
customers have so

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:01,600
use cases change all the time people use

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,240
many different tools in ways that i'm

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,640
sure the

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,240
creators of those tools never thought um

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,080
so just always examining

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,000
those different use cases and making

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,799
sure you're maintaining documentation

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,120
very frequently um because this is a

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,640
place

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,320
it's a central place and you can cause a

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
lot of toil if it's um

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,160
very uh it's not there's gaps right you

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,720
can cause a lot of toil from your end

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,320
users

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,080
so just prioritizing that i think is a

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,000
great thing to do within your company

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,919
i think yeah as you mentioned iteration

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,360
is key in developing any features but

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,360
more importantly in developing and

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,720
maintaining documentation as well

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,640
and we've been talking about the

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,000
distributing nature distributed nature

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
of the teams nowadays

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,200
and i would like to ask you that

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,840
currently we know that developer

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,919
experience

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,240
aims to improve the complete or the

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,559
overall software development life cycle

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,440
however i would like to ask you how it

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,799
actually

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,880
having a good developer experience

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,960
internally how can it impact the culture

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
but more importantly can it help to

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,240
build like

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,080
different recruitment strategies by any

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,000
chances

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,159
absolutely um i i firmly believe and i'm

00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,679
probably biased but i feel like a great

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,520
developer experience can make the

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,640
difference um when making like an offer

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,080
to a candidate

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,080
um especially if you use it and sort of

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,440
stage it as a perspective i'm sorry a

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,720
competitive advantage

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:22,320
um because if you are using the latest

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,200
and greatest tooling

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,120
but also have a great culture of your

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,159
developers being heard right those

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,159
developers

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,720
their feedback being taken into account

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,440
when planning future tooling decisions

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,640
or even process decisions i think it's

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,039
very important for

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,840
our developers to be heard and word of

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,960
mouth

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,919
is so powerful um you know within the

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,400
tech community

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
like developers talk to other developers

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
right so if someone is having a great

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,120
experience and leveraging amazing

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,600
tooling

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,679
and you know are just like kicking butt

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
on delivering features i think that

00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,799
that sells itself you want you want that

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,840
experience so it can

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,240
kind of spread like wildfire within the

being a co-chair for kipcon what are

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,960
your feelings about this month

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,360
i i was like just super humbled and like

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,799
i

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,960
felt so privileged like to even be

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,000
thought of because like being a part of

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,400
this community i

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,840
that was a win for me like learning from

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,200
peer companies learning from peers of

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
different companies like that

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,559
was the win for me but now to be able to

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,799
work with the other

00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,000
like veteran co-chairs like steven and

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,799
constance and

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,640
learn more about the process of how this

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,640
experience is shaped and how

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,400
we're like fostering and nurturing the

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,120
community um it's a real

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,720
real privilege so i'm really looking

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,200
forward to

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,080
going from a participant and taking the

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,320
gems

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,919
that are dropped and within the cfp

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,200
process right

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,840
going through and seeing the themes

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,919
there double clicking on a lot of them

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,400
to understand like the perspective of

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,440
abstracts and understanding exactly how

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,520
we can shape

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,039
new conversations and bring about these

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,600
new perspectives

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,880
that a lot of presenters will bring for

00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,679
the conference

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,400
outside of just having insight into the

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
themes

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,840
i think that the community is one of the

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
most important things

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,919
um and one of like near and dear to my

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,280
heart as it relates to kubecon and

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,640
native khan so being able to help people

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,559
from especially non-traditional

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,159
backgrounds um get more involved within

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,360
the cloud native community

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,080
and understand what their perspectives

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,320
are

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,360
how we can help lift them up within the

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,880
community

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,720
as well as connect with other end users

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,480
like i was an end user and

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,640
i was coming into this space learning a

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,919
lot but i'm highlighting other end users

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,120
on their journey companies that are

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,200
doing great things

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,880
and building community with with them so

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,159
that we can all help each other

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,159
all things that i'm looking forward to

00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,400
in this role

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,520
this is great actually so currently i'm

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,720
definitely looking forward to the

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
keynotes which are going to be of course

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,360
curated by

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,960
by the co-chairs so yes i think it's

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,679
going to be great um and i think the

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,440
community

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,000
is absolutely blessed to have someone

00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,320
like you as a co-chair as well

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,360
and moving towards more of the technical

00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,600
part of kubecon

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,760
now that capcom europe is uh it's

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,200
complete we have some seen some of the

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,600
underlying themes and

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,600
maybe some categories of new tooling

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,520
such as like wasm or

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,039
security edge i think is always going to

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,039
be there

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,559
at this stage i know it's quite early um

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,480
but do you envision

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,000
any any new predictions or new themes

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
that are going to be covered during cape

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,480
cod on a

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,720
or maybe some trends you've seen from

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,679
your perspective as an as an end user

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,000
and as part of the community or more

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,640
involved

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,600
in the community nowadays yeah

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,880
absolutely so

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,960
um it is quite early um but based on

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,559
kind of what i've the pulse like out

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,480
there of what i've been hearing

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,960
um through the grapevine twitter places

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,480
like that um i think that once i go

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
through the north america process i have

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,200
a much better

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,360
idea but i i just i think that the new

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,039
technologies new projects like wasm you

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,559
mentioned are going to be

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,240
highlighted in ways as they start to get

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:02,400
adopted by

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,480
additional end users right so finding

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,840
new use cases and ways to apply these

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,360
new technologies is what i'm most

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,840
interested in learning about

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,039
um and we've seen like from cloud

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,640
kubecon

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,600
eu different ways that people are

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,320
applying um technologies for covid like

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,480
you know

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,440
utilizing um cloud native technologies

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,320
to

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,159
literally save the world um so it's it's

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,799
very interesting to hear those um

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:28,799
really impactful in user stories so i'm

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,640
hoping that they start to reference some

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,120
incubated projects um

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,039
so that way we can uh just learn new use

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,559
cases new ways to solve

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,520
problems out there in the world using

00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,000
these new new capabilities

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,919
absolutely so um when you're mentioning

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,080
about uh how can we apply cloud native

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,840
technologies to real use cases um

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,600
priyanka actually had a great keynote on

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,600
how can we apply this within the the

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,679
copy time so i definitely would uh

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,600
would encourage everyone to to see that

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,640
keynote and watch it again i think it

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,200
it's done great

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,039
on that one the other thing that i

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,679
wanted to focus on as well is of course

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,600
jasmine

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,600
you are a big advocate for diversity and

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:08,320
inclusion within the technology

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,159
industry so i'd like to kind of maybe um

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,760
explore your view of

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,279
what do you think or where do you think

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,960
the diversion inclusion stands

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,880
at the moment within the cloud native

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,120
ecosystem

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,320
absolutely um so this is very important

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,600
to me and

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,960
i i feel like at this point in

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,000
like life and where we are as a country

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,000
in the world

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,120
um diversity inclusion is definitely a

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,559
part of

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,320
a lot of conversations that are

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,200
happening um which is great

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,480
um it's really important that there's

00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,559
acknowledgement of the

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,559
gaps that do exist within multiple

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,360
spaces not just cloud native and tech in

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,520
general

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,200
um so i'm so happy that these

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,880
conversations are even starting

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,240
um because it's been this way for a

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,240
while but now that the conversations are

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,840
starting we can start to work towards

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,440
making it a better better environment

00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:58,080
for everyone

00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,480
so i think that we do have a long way to

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,720
go

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,080
um but like i mentioned the conversation

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,520
has started i do think there are

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,679
companies that are doing great

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,760
things to make sure that people from

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,400
underrepresented backgrounds

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,679
are lifted up and enabled in ways that

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,279
they weren't before

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,520
um you know the cncf process like a cncf

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,640
you know conference process making sure

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,760
that we have

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:25,120
allies that are working with these

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:26,720
underrepresented folks to work on talks

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,559
making sure we have representation

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,880
within all the talks um are really great

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,279
things to do

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,480
i feel like our code of conduct the

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:37,039
things that we do to make sure

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,080
folks feel comfortable um will also help

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,360
make sure that we have good

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,880
participation

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,559
for folks from folks from other groups

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,080
too so i think we're

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,679
we're doing great we have a long way to

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,279
go to go um

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,440
but it's just a continuous conversation

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,679
that we have to just kind of keep top of

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,679
mind

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,720
yeah again again i think it's it's one

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,080
of those things that we need to keep

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,120
talking and it should be at the

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,880
forefront especially now that we have um

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,480
more conferences and the community is

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,760
growing and we have more elements which

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,159
are going to be virtual we are going to

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,440
have

00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,360
hopefully some elements that are going

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,440
to be um in person as well

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,960
so hopefully we're going to um be

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,559
considerate of all of the diverse

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,399
inclusion practices

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,240
um and another question i want uh to ask

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,080
from this point is um

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,760
how do you feel what do you think we

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,440
could do as a community to

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,919
increase the engagement from these

00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,960
underrepresented groups

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,520
yes absolutely so i think that

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,320
it's important to just to be there um as

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,320
an ally

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,679
for um people that are from

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,039
underrepresented

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,640
uh groups and make sure that

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,720
you know we're making them feel

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,000
comfortable right this is a new space um

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,919
it's you know making sure they feel

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,159
comfortable contributing

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,440
whether it's you know to the point of

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,320
contributing to even some of the

00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,039
projects right

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,559
um if a folk a person does not have a

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,640
traditional background that it may

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,399
be a little daunting to kind of hop into

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,520
open source contributions so

00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,760
there's someone who's interested in

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:02,399
doing that support them in that process

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,840
um and use it as like a mentoring like

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,159
opportunity i think that there's a lot

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,320
of

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,760
great leaders within the cloud native

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,480
community that we have

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,120
um and using everything you know to lift

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:14,320
someone

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,840
else up is such a such a great thing to

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,679
do it's just really really great thing

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,559
to do so i think that that's one thing

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,640
we can do

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,840
uh to really start to increase

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,080
engagement um

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,399
and pull people in to our fantastic

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,240
world that we've created yeah

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,799
i couldn't agree more one thing that i

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,960
want to mention here is that um

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,720
there we have the diversity scholarships

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,159
that you can apply for if you'd like to

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:38,320
attend kipcon so if you

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,919
a part of this one underrepresented

00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,559
groups you'll be able to join the

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,720
conference

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,919
um we're going to give well the cncf is

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,600
going to give you a ticket

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,520
and what i want to mention here is that

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,919
that was my first experience how i got

00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,000
into

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,279
into the community i got to go to

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,360
kubecon in seattle that was in 2018.

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,279
sounds like eight years ago but that was

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,320
one of these still personally for me was

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,159
one of the best um cube cons ever um it

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,520
was in seattle i'd remember the keynote

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,360
stage and of course we had uh

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,840
at the time kelsey hightower giving a

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,320
killer keynote so for me that was when i

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,880
got

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,240
the the kind of the maximum proximity to

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,799
the community and i i couldn't be

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,279
delighted

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,640
uh more and that's why i stayed since um

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,760
since that clipcon i'm still part of the

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,520
community now so

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,039
i would encourage everyone to to do the

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,559
first step and um

00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,080
again we have the diverse scholarships

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,440
for kubecon and make sure

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,279
to apply for them as well and the

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,840
last series of questions that i have are

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,799
around the end user experience

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,120
since we've been working for

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,480
organizations such as delta airlines and

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,960
twitter and both of them are

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,480
end-user organizations which means they

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,200
use cloud-native tools but they don't

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,039
sell it so

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,200
vendor neutrality the true practitioners

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:47,600
we have is first-hand experience of

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,919
adopting and integrating tools

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,279
so could you please share maybe from an

00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,159
end user perspective

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,039
what was your experience being part of

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,000
this community

00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,360
um and how do you uh make the best use

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,559
of your um

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,360
maybe end user stages if i could say so

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,200
yeah it's a great status to have and i'm

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,399
so happy like we're highlighting end

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,279
users um because

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,200
there's a lot of value in using um cloud

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,200
native technologies within

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,720
large companies and you know solving

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,760
problems unique problems

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,840
um so my experience um started

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,960
a little like different than yours katie

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,200
so i actually

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,240
got thrusted into the cloud native world

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,159
um by

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,600
being a part of delta um in my company

00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:32,159
which isn't the case for most folks so

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,320
that's why it's so great that um cncf is

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,840
scholarships to encourage other folks

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,200
who don't have that opportunity to be a

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,480
part of this great world

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:41,679
um so during my time at delta i'm not

00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,240
even sure that like you know

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,120
the end user sort of term or status was

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,799
a thing

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,640
um but there was just always great

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,159
stories always great stories of how

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,200
companies were applying

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:55,200
um kubernetes um you know different type

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,000
of capabilities messaging capabilities

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,880
to

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,320
really level up the value that they were

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,279
delivering um to their external

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,559
customers

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,320
um and at the time we were very early

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,000
in our cloud native journey and one of

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,000
the main focuses that i had was we

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,679
cannot reinvent the world right

00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,039
one i didn't have the people to really

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,120
sort of like develop all these things

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,679
internally so we try to you know do it

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,360
any

00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,120
you know great things as we try to take

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,679
as much as we can right and then form it

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,039
up into

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,039
uh a solution for our purpose so

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,360
um my experience was just focusing on

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,000
those stories and learnings um

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:31,679
and it made getting started with cloud

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,720
native a lot easier because we didn't

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,960
have to

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,919
go through the uh sort of the toil and

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,320
like the

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,960
you know the failures that other folks

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,399
went in

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,080
to like it was a very transparent

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,880
conversation people talked about where

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,880
they went wrong

00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,159
and how they would improve it if they

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
could go back and do it and we took

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,399
those

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,880
tidbits and formed up our own journey

00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,120
another aspect of being an end user is

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,320
that you know a lot of times you know we

00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,399
do leverage vendor vendor tools

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,840
so they were part of the conversation

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:04,159
too which was really great

00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:06,399
they wanted us to be great as well so we

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,279
were supported in that aspect as too so

00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:10,399
it was a really great experience i'm

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:12,159
happy to still be

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,600
in the end user sort of status at

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,200
twitter although it's from like just a

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,799
different like side of things um

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,799
but it's just a great community to build

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,960
relationships and and be able to talk

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,840
transparently about your challenges

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:24,240
um sort of like a support group um but

00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,240
it's

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,760
you know a little we talk about how we

00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,799
can get past those things we don't just

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,799
dwell on the failures

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,480
this is great yeah i couldn't agree more

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,159
with with the end users i think the

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
experience is so important but

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,919
i would like them to share more of how

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,519
they use these tools um yeah so again

00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,080
hopefully gonna see more more of these

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,799
stories

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,480
uh in our future future events as well

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,880
and one of the last questions i have for

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,200
you

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,039
is again how can we contribute back so

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,159
from your perspective how as an end is

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,240
organizations

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,120
is the best way to contribute to the

00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,480
wider cloud native landscape

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,480
absolutely um as an end user i feel

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:04,640
that you know i've taken a lot of

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,880
stories a lot of

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,159
just information from the community and

00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,839
it's important to give back

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,599
right it's the you know reciprocal

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,040
relationship you know if you're using

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,919
and you're learning from others within

00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,679
the community

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,359
um share your learnings how are you

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,200
applying what they um

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:20,879
are putting out there um how is it

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:22,800
working for you you know having those

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:25,200
transparent conversations um

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,720
you can do that by way of submitting to

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,480
you know cfps you know

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,480
the kubecon north america one just

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,119
closed but there's um ones coming soon

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,040
after

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,639
um so that you can tell that story um

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,639
and we are really focused on

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,200
highlighting end user stories because

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,679
there's

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:40,960
there's so much there's jewels within

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,000
all stories

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,159
um articles i know that the cncf

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,599
supports like articles writing about the

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,079
different uh

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,440
really just uh journeys and steps that

00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,839
companies are taking to

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,280
uh reach cloud native um and implement

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,639
it within their organization

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,640
so working with like partners from the

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,079
cnc's you have to do that participating

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,079
in streams like this

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,760
are all great ways to um tell your story

00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,079
another component i think that's very

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,800
important is if you're leveraging um

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,680
cncf

00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,240
projects heavily internally um how can

00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,480
you

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,839
operationalize giving back to that open

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,960
source project

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,440
making sure that you know if you are

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,200
building on right the open source uh

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,200
component with internally

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,119
why not contribute that information back

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:30,160
it could be solving a problem for

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,200
another end user out there because we we

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,280
heavily rely on open source to build

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,960
value for our external customers so

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,960
giving back in in helping

00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,000
giving another company a hand up is a

00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,200
really great way

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,079
to get involved as well well that was

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,240
truly inspirational

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,680
and fantastic castro i would say i would

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,599
like i would encourage everyone to take

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,079
these uh these advices

00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,760
um so pretty much these are all of the

00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:55,040
the questions and topics we wanted to

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,800
