00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,399
hello and welcome to the cncf end user

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,320
lounge

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,399
where we explore how cloud native

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,079
technologies are being adopted by end

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,039
user organizations across

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,760
different industries the ccf end user

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
community

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,920
consists of more than 145 vendor neutral

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,559
companies

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,840
that use open source software to deliver

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,399
their products

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,280
my name is cheryl hung and i'm the vp of

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
ecosystem

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,040
at cncf so in these live streams we're

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,400
very excited to bring along some of our

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
end user members

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,119
to showcase how their organizations

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,040
navigate cloud native

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,479
and use it to build and distribute their

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
services and products

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,920
and we are on every thursday sorry every

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,600
fourth thursday

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,040
at 9am pt this is an official live

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,439
stream of the cncf

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,720
and as such is subject to the cncf code

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,799
of conduct

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
please don't add anything to the chat or

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,720
ask any questions that would be in

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,560
violation of that code of conduct

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,159
just be respectful towards all of your

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,439
fellow participants and towards the

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,360
presenters

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,720
if you have any questions for us then we

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,360
will be monitoring them throughout the

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,439
stream

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,759
just ask your questions through the live

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,680
stream chat

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,479
so this week we have peritus dot ai

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,439
here with us so before we dive into some

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,159
questions

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,920
could you please introduce yourself

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,759
thanks sheryl thanks for having me here

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,119
no it's pretty exciting because i

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,880
watched the two

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
sessions that were there in the last two

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,399
months and

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,080
one was from cern other from twitter i

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,080
have interacted with both organizations

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
in a past life from an open source

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
perspective so this is awesome to have a

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
startup

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,520
and on this conference yeah thank you

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,040
yeah i am santor srinivasan

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,959
i am the co-founder and head of

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,720
engineering of perito state ai

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,080
so we are building out knowledge

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,560
networks to help

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,239
developer self-service where they work

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,599
and this knowledge comes from experts

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,920
they trust

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,959
on all of our platform is built on cloud

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,480
native technologies

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,800
so this is a great forum for us to

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,400
discuss this

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,720
fantastic um i know that sanchez you're

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,000
a

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,599
co-founder at peritus.ai so

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,040
maybe you can tell us a bit about the

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,239
story of how

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,000
you started this company why

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,720
why was this an interesting problem for

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,319
you yeah it's a fantastic question so

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,640
just a little bit of a background about

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,280
my

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,120
own career i started my career in the

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,720
labs development center

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,319
later i went to grad school and landed

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,599
up at yahoo where we were working on

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,760
what we used to call as

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,760
large scale data processing and that

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,080
eventually became big data

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,680
i got lucky and i was introduced to the

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
hadoop ecosystem by a good friend of

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,000
mine arun murthy one of the

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,120
lead engineers on hadoop and that

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,760
journey began in

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,280
2008 about 13 and a half years ago into

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,519
open source

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,799
so in that journey we built hadoop at

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
yahoo for yahoo

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,040
it was not commercial it was not meant

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,720
to be used by other people

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,280
as is but it was meant to foster

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,239
innovation and what we noticed was with

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,799
open source

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,680
if things work people pick it up and the

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,080
adoption is

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
really tremendous i noticed two or three

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
different flavors in open source where

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,599
you can have

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,040
viral adoption one was the yahoo flavor

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,120
where we built something at

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,640
rapid scale massive scale hundreds of

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
millions of dollars

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,720
it was somewhat enterprise ready but

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,400
within yahoo and the other one is

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,560
something like or elastic where

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
it's so easy to use and people gravitate

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,200
towards it because

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,920
they can use it and get to go without

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,159
having to talk to many other people

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,200
the hadoop ecosystem became so massive

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,280
that entities started commercializing it

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,599
and i ended up in one of those entities

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,359
called cloudera so i went from being

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:21,919
a end-user contributor committer

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,759
to a governance member in apache to

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,199
participating in a commercial activity

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,199
at cloudera

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
and at cloudera what i noticed being on

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,160
the other side is

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,320
open source is easy if you're a

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,479
developer but if your skill levels are

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,479
below that of a developer it's extremely

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,680
challenging to use

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,520
and that's where the enterprise

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,199
companies were forming and this is the

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
genesis of parities

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,720
how do you take technology and make it

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,800
consumable

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,560
by a large set of people who may not

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
have the same level of skills as the

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,000
creators of those projects

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
and that's why we're building out this

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,360
knowledge network to help people

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,759
get to that as quickly as they can

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
that's awesome i mean it's definitely

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:04,800
something i agree with that

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,479
if you are a developer open source is

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
pretty great it's pretty fantastic if

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,440
you're not there's a very high barrier

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,759
to entry

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,759
so i make too excited to see how paris

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,759
is going to help

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,000
kind of lower that barrier to entry um

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
let's talk a little bit about your

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,120
company your team as well

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,520
so what you're the vp of engineering

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
is that correct that is correct yeah

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,759
yeah so what are the

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,080
responsibilities of you and your team

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,840
now yeah so one of the things about

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,759
being a co-founder is my official title

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,639
is co-founder of vp of engineering i do

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,160
a ton of things

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,680
and sometimes people call you as the

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
chief janitor as well so you have to do

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,039
anything that relates to the company

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,120
but my primary responsibility is to

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,199
build out technology and product

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,800
so a significant amount of our

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,360
engineering resources are

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,919
built towards using the technology to

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,759
rapidly build features in the product

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,520
so one chunk of the engineering arc is

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,039
for infrastructure because without

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,400
infrastructure you cannot build out

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,560
product quickly

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,160
and when i first started the company and

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,880
since now it's been about three

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,960
and a half years the challenge was i

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,160
came from the big data scale out

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,520
technology

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,680
and we are trying to try those

00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,120
technologies and this is when kubernetes

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,560
are sort of taking off

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,440
and it was not quite mature so we tried

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,199
a few things

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,759
and finally settled on kubernetes about

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,319
two years ago and we invested a lot of

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,240
energy into doing both the scale out

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
and also giving developers flexibility

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
to spin up things on demand to do their

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,400
own innovation so that's one part of the

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,960
organization which is infrastructure

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,960
and we try to use multiple cloud

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,919
providers because some of our customers

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,520
tend to

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,240
say hey you just have to work on one or

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,319
the other and we wanted to be

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,319
careful here because if you choose any

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,440
cloud native technology hosted by the

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,000
provider

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,560
you're kind of stuck in some sense it's

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
awesome

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,520
it's i would say it's the value is

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,280
tremendous but if someone else wants you

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,599
to be on a different cloud provider

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,360
it's challenging so we decided okay

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,919
everything is going to be containerized

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,599
everything is going to have rest apis

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,759
and we'll use kubernetes

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,919
and then make sure it complies with

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,520
whatever the cloud provider hosts so

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:14,080
it's easy to migrate from one to the

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,240
other

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,240
on demand so nice yeah

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,039
so we use a bunch of technologies from

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,560
cncf uh the prominent ones are already

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,520
popular kubernetes helm we use cada

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
the cert manager prometheus we are

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,360
looking into

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,560
using falco and for security purposes

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
and a bunch of other open source

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,199
technologies elastic

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
lucine based stuff you know the list

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,440
goes on and on we are heavy into open

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
source

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,280
well of course i am pleased that you use

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,440
cloud native within your infrastructure

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,479
who would be quite funny if you didn't

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,599
um and yeah

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:58,000
i'm also quite fascinated to hear that

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,680
you tr you looked at a few different

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,160
things before settling

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,400
on kubernetes is that right oh that's

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,400
right

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,120
can you share some of how you thought

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,919
and why you made that decision

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,120
it's just uh experience bias and so when

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,280
when i left

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,360
cloudera we were trying to launch a

00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,800
cloud initiative to spin up clusters on

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,599
demand to do scale out

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,080
and elastic stuff so when we came in and

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,520
we were

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,879
saying okay let me first check the

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,080
context of what's the problem you're

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,759
trying to solve

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,080
we are trying to build out a knowledge

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,440
network so knowledge resides in multiple

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,560
forums documentations

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,519
kb articles forum conversations

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,640
github issues github pr comments and all

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,640
of those things

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,000
so now we want this from everywhere in

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,839
one central location

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,920
we have a knowledge graph which supports

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,360
what we finally end up doing is provide

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,399
recommendations to developers

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
as they are working so we have a machine

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,600
learning team

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
of a few engineers who are rapidly doing

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
experimentation to try out the quality

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,399
of these recommendations

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,880
we have the infrastructure team trying

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,600
to help you know spin up scale down

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,080
and maintain stuff and then we have the

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,480
data crawling ingestion and organization

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,640
team

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,959
and then finally you have a full stack

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,640
ui ux team trying to productize the

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,680
underlying technology

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,080
so these are the four different

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,560
components to the organization so coming

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
from a

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,880
big data technology i said okay crawling

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,000
is a solved problem so let's just spin

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,600
up things

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
processing is interesting because it

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,800
depends what you want to process and how

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,720
so since i came from the hadoop

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:32,000
background we tried a few things there

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,320
uh it worked but it was slow so then we

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,320
were

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
a little bit stuck about hey how do you

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,360
really make this scale out and not be

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,279
stuck to a

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,120
hosted service from a given cloud

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,240
provider because migration becomes a

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,640
problem

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,640
that's when we landed on kubernetes and

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,080
it is challenging

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,680
the reason it is challenging is we are

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
highly skilled engineers

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,000
people who have been at bigger companies

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,160
with the same background

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,240
and getting to use technology is one

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,959
thing but if things don't work

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,760
try to find out why fix them as soon as

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,360
possible

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,360
without waiting on the community to

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
provide a fix and i've been on the other

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
side

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,680
providing the technology now i was

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,079
consuming technology from open source

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,240
while trying to have very fast product

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,480
iteration

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,640
so that's how we landed on kubernetes

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,800
and that journey began roughly two and a

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,560
half years ago

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,640
and what does your infrastructure look

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,279
like now you mentioned you have multiple

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,040
you use different clouds um can you give

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,560
us an idea of like the size of

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,079
your clusters yeah so we do things on

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,200
demand so what we have done is

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:40,079
uh for production usage we have a

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,920
hot hot setup so in case things go wrong

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,920
we can rapidly switch between

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,000
two clusters and they run in their own

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,440
name spaces and kubernetes

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
we have somewhat of a staging

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,480
environment that we prep before we go

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,040
live on production

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,920
so we want to do testing and stuff and

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,160
for developers

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,440
they can spin anything on demand so we

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,440
have integrated

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,959
uh right from the time you do a commit

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,760
your pr gets merged

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,600
you can get it deployed on the cloud uh

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,200
almost within a matter of minutes

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,399
into your own developer namespace and

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,079
you can create as many developer

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,760
namespaces as possible because you're

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,200
doing rapid prototyping

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,120
so let's take an example of you're doing

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,320
a feature development and feature

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,760
development cuts across

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
all of these four different teams

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,079
infrastructure machine learning data

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,640
ingestion

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,320
and uiux so you want this subset of

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,560
engineers working on a feature

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,760
to work on a feature branch and you

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,519
should be able to deploy to the

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,440
namespace for this feature branch

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,880
from each commit to your own developer

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
namespace and when you think it's

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,440
reasonably stable

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,800
you go through your pr review process

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
merge the branch to

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,120
your main branch and then the next

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,160
release we try to do one or two releases

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,920
per week

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
it goes to staging and then we promote

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,360
it to production

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,600
so this whole life cycle has been built

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,519
on the public cloud infrastructure

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,959
with some caveats we trained to use

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,720
let's say jenkins

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,160
we didn't pick any of the build

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,320
infrastructure in the cloud

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
because sometimes when you want to do a

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,560
build our builds happen

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,639
within a minute incremental builds and

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,079
most of these cloud native stock

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
infrastructure they don't give you that

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,440
they can go up to two minutes not up to

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,760
a minute

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,760
so we went for developer efficiency and

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,200
speed as the first order

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,639
for building infra hmm

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,320
oh very cool it sounds like you have a

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,000
pretty smooth pipeline then

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,279
for the very nice developer experience

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,560
you could say um you mentioned some of

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,760
the challenges

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,160
as well earlier that you faced so

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,360
right now what would you say are your

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
biggest challenges

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,880
when you're building infrastructure or

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,079
you're managing

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,040
and deploying applications yeah

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,639
so you brought up pipelines so a lot of

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,000
the work is the workflow

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,720
orchestration between different

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,160
components which are all micro services

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,519
so when we first started building

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,279
pipelines i have a lot of experience

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,800
building pipelines right from my yahoo

00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
days to cloudera days and i've built

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,440
many

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,760
execution engines to do that so we

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,440
picked some of those to start with

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
i'll just name a few for the audience

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,200
here we picked airflow

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,000
uh i was the development manager for

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
woozi which is

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,560
incredibly difficult to use airflow was

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,600
very very simple to use but it lacked a

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,120
bunch of features

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
and we are trying to make a workflow

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,519
engine work in kubernetes

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,320
we looked at kubeflow uh kubeflow was

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,720
like

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,639
very very nascent when we picked it up

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
and we couldn't quite close the feature

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,399
gap for us to

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,800
be off to the races a challenge we had

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,120
when talking internally was

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,639
understanding the mission on the vision

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,920
of this open source project

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,839
while you're trying to pick the

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,760
technology is a challenge

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,079
if you end up picking the wrong one

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,800
you'll have to pay the migration cost

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,399
later on that's still within the company

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,720
the bigger challenge is

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,240
if you hire someone they may not even be

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
familiar with the technology that you

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,079
picked

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,000
even though it's open source so i mean

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,079
at the higher order stack you have these

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,839
angular versus react battles going on

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,720
so i have more more of a core back-end

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,880
technologist not a front-end ui person

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
so if you as you go to the back end

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,639
these are the fundamental pieces you're

00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,560
building on you can't change them

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,760
quickly compared to the higher layers of

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,959
the stack

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,639
so when you're thinking about this

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,279
workflow thing we tried a few we tried

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,199
air flow

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,720
it worked initially but it wouldn't work

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,240
for us then we

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
really explored to see hey have you

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
built a kubernetes integration that we

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,600
can contribute to

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,279
oh it was not there then we looked at

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,440
cube flow as

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,639
too nascent for us to pick up then we

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,560
said okay

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,680
begrudgingly we agreed let's build

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,639
something in-house

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,600
knowing that at some point in time we'll

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:41,279
give this up

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,959
or migrate to something which is more

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,639
standard

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,000
so we have something built internally

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,760
which looks exactly like any other

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,240
workflow engine

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,880
just that it works for us and in the

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,959
next

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,399
two quarters or a year we'll start

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,079
migrating away from these

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,560
we are looking at ml flow and kubeflow

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,720
for the machine learning parts

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,000
argo argo is something that we are very

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,079
interested in because

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,680
the activity in argos started picking up

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,040
last year

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,720
if you look at the commit history of

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,920
argo i think the first official comment

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,639
on cncf

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,519
github repurchases in 2017 the project

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,240
itself was around from 2015 2016.

00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,760
so if we had known that argo was active

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,199
that would have been a more natural

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,839
choice for us to pick

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,519
when we made our choices back in

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,360
2018-2019

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,800
always very hard to know how things will

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
turn out in the future though

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,160
right two or three years down the line

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
um yeah

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,680
interesting to hear how you've had to

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,079
make those decisions

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
upfront how you've chosen to make them

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,000
well i had a lead

00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,759
come to me and say don't build anything

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,839
in-house

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,360
and the reason he said is we'll train

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,560
people on a bunch of proprietary

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,279
technologies

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,279
and that skill is not portable and when

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,639
we hire smart engineers we'll spend like

00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,800
a month or two training them on

00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,759
our technology that's not useful to us

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,040
either

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,920
he pretty much said it's a lose-lose

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,920
proposition for us

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,600
yeah i mean that's totally fair i've

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,079
heard this as well from other companies

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,680
that

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:10,959
one of the benefits of open source is

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,920
that you don't need to spend time

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,120
training or retraining people

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,000
when they come in or out um let's take a

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,839
slightly different

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,600
angle now because i'd love to hear from

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,920
both your experience and

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
from what you've seen in the in the

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,880
knowledge base

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
that you're building out i'd love to

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,440
talk about some trends and predictions

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:38,560
for cloud native so just to start with

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
over the last let's say three four five

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,000
years

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,279
that cloud native has been around um

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,320
what are some of the

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,120
some of the trends that you've seen yeah

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,000
so we actually did a deep analysis of

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,079
cncf

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,120
so i have that maybe we can talk offline

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,040
about it but

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,639
so here are some interesting things i

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,920
found that you may already know right so

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,800
i looked at the

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,440
graduated and incubating projects right

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,360
i didn't we

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,959
although we have used some sandbox

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,880
projects i just narrowed the focus to

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,720
something which is well known

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,919
so there are 36 projects in that list

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:16,240
just as a quick tidbit for one project

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,839
emissary ingress there is no reference

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,760
to any of their activity on the main

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,919
landing page for cncf

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,679
so including that i mean there's no

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,799
reference to any github link community

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,120
page or anything

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,400
everything else is very nicely set up on

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,280
the cncf webpage

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,240
i know where the github repo is the dev

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,000
stats

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,440
and where the community is if they do

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,760
have a community

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
so interesting stats now that you asked

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,960
is 70

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,720
of them have a twitter account it's

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,400
omnichannel so they have to have a

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,919
presence online

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,039
uh two thirds of them are on

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,039
uh stack overflow

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,880
two-thirds uh about just north of sixty

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,679
percent

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,039
are on slack or they support a public

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,039
slack channel

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,200
and then after that it starts going down

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,600
they some of them have google groups

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,600
and why is this important for an open

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,000
source project to be successful you need

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,799
a

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,760
thriving community you need people who

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,000
can help answer

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,120
questions so that both developers and

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,080
end users can

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,440
rapidly use adopt and build out features

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,000
and technologies

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,960
so what this tells me is if you take out

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,320
kubernetes

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,039
and grpc they over dominate the

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,960
activities going on in cncf

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,840
so we we actually did analysis saying

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,679
with and without kubernetes

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,080
then we found out we have to also also

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,520
do with and without kubernetes

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:45,039
and grpc right

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,200
so what it told me is uh most of the

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,039
action is happening on github issues

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,760
most of it we also analyze the stack

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,840
overflow

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,679
traffic for these communities it's

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,400
anemic it's anemic

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,240
so they have overall a challenge of

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,919
building out communities to rapidly

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,520
evolve and move from sandbox to

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,640
incubating to

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,400
a graduated project

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,360
so if you're if you're mostly on github

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
issues it means

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,960
it's a developer-centric community the

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:18,160
end-user community is

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,760
you know somewhat missing in action

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,520
that's so interesting to hear actually

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,679
because i

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,799
i assumed that everything would be close

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,559
to 100

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,480
on slack and on twitter um

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,240
actually that surprises me that those

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,880
numbers are quite low well not

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,280
low but they're not 100 yeah right so if

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,559
you if you really think about

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,559
people who are using these these

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,160
technologies are complex let's first

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,840
state that this is not

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,120
uh easy technology so people are

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,360
building it are very sharp very smart

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,960
i'm talking about the after building of

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,600
the technology or in the process of

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,400
building out

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,400
how do you get it off the ground so you

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,679
need to have an omni channel presence so

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,480
most of them have that

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,840
in place but they have to be where the

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,919
developers are

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,039
they have to be where the end users are

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,200
and for that

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,799
most of them use the technology on their

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,159
computers right

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,520
you you're probably not doing something

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,159
on your kubernetes cluster on your

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,200
mobile phone or ipad

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,200
probably no it's not and so most of the

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,400
action tends to happen on slack

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,320
because that's where you want to have a

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
question and there is this

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,559
metric known as developer satisfaction

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,520
right i ask a question

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,480
how many hours before i go and make my

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
own choice

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,200
before somebody has to respond so if i

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
don't get a reasonable response within

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,919
my working day

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,480
and if you say let's say i post a

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,600
question at 4 pm then maybe the next day

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,840
morning

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,840
i am going to do something on my own

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,440
right so 24-hour window is kind of the

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,240
sweet spot

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,280
so what we i'm on several of the cncf

00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,360
slack channels

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,039
so i see this activity it's very high

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,280
activity and these public

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,559
slack channels have a shortcoming right

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,360
because slack doesn't

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,559
give you free versions with infinite

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,039
capacity

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,960
at 10 000 messages you age out

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,640
people tend to ask the same question

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,640
over and over again on slack

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,159
so there's a gap here right so people

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,679
who are building out the product

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,840
they are fatigued by trying to answer

00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:22,720
the same question they have to dedicate

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,240
time to answer questions on slack and

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,080
you have to set aside time so that's a

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,600
challenge you can't expect people to be

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,280
doing product development

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,520
and support and community building

00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,360
simultaneously

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,120
so that that's an open problem and we i

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,679
think we we're working on a solution

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,440
there

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,320
uh happy to chat on how we can offer it

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,559
completely free to all of cncf

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,320
oh that would be interesting yeah let's

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:47,840
we can chat about this um

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,200
offline as you say um do you have

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,760
any predictions that you think are

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,360
going to come up in the next or maybe

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,360
through the rest of 2021

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,960
and into next year well

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,480
always dangerous i know to make

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,559
predictions

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,840
um it's not going to hold you to them

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:11,200
especially when things are recorded

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,080
just between you nobody else well i can

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,720
give you an abstract

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,440
notion of what will help make these

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,760
predictions

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,440
and maybe then we can use that to say

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,960
what might happen like i said

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,200
at the beginning what kind of open

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,559
source technologies tend to succeed

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,159
technologies that have been proven

00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,679
within an enterprise company that are

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,559
being open sourced

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,440
and technologies that are easy to use so

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,280
these are two

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,480
key factors that is just on the product

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,000
side

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,159
and the winners are actually going to be

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,919
people who build out communities

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,600
where you can ask a question get a

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,039
response as an end user or as a

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,200
developer

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,039
in the larger scheme of things the

00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,400
half-life of a project is dependent on

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,960
the community i've been in

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,440
apache where many many projects have

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,640
been

00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,440
shut down they move into apache attic

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:00,880
and that's a sad state of affairs one

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,640
really massive project is apache misos

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,960
very cool project i've seen that demos

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
have talked to one of their founders

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,159
it's a really impressive technology but

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,080
unfortunately they're considering moving

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,039
it into an attic right that's very sad

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,919
to see

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,760
very complex highly useful project so

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,360
you have to build out to your community

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,440
and you have to build it out so that it

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,200
sustains beyond the initial founders

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,200
involvement

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,039
and when it gets incubated or when it

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,080
graduates

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,320
so based on these three things maturity

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,840
ease of use community you can predict

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,360
which of the open source projects in

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,310
cncf

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,520
are going to be successful

00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,000
[Music]

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,679
um interesting to hear that and also i i

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,120
very much agree with you that community

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,679
building is much harder

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,039
than it seems um takes a lot of time

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,600
takes a lot of persistence

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:51,600
but it's the only way for the project to

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:55,200
outlive the original maintainers

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,039
that's correct um so what do you think

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,240
is the most surprising thing

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,919
that you've seen so far like now that

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,520
parasite ai has been around for a little

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,840
while like

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,159
anything surprising that you've seen uh

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,799
so i've been on a lot of the apache side

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,880
of things

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,080
in terms of governance and all of those

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,840
things and i am

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,400
relatively new to cncf the whole model

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,320
i recently reviewed the due diligence

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
document for argo

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,000
which is trying to move from incubating

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,080
to graduated

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,159
i i was very happy to see the level of

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,919
rigor that goes into

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,200
declaring a project to be ready for the

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,840
next stage i was really

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,559
impressed with the level of rigor on the

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,720
mechanics of how the decision is made

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,720
it's so public everybody can see the

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,640
decision making that's impressive

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,400
because transparency means people trust

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,200
the process

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,400
and the last part i find uh somewhat

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,080
funny but also

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,480
and i found it i found i had a good

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,320
feeling is everything it was on git

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:59,200
for a developer that's awesome uh yeah

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,000
so that for me cncf and the last part i

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
forgot to mention

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,880
is open source is also all about

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,679
licensing

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,640
uh i think 100 of cncf projects are

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,799
apache software license 2.0

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,559
and that's we definitely strongly

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,960
recommend yeah

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,960
yeah so that that's very friendly both

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,760
for people contributing and when you

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,520
import the technology in uh you're

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,240
you're fine in terms of the legality of

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,000
using it

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,840
there are certain open source licenses

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,679
where you have to think 100 times before

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,480
thinking or picking it up because it may

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,760
have to

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,120
it triggers these things of hey if

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,559
you're using it you have to open source

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,080
everything around it and it's

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,480
too complex yeah

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,279
yeah definitely open source licensing is

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,600
um

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,080
before i joined cncf i did not have a

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,760
clue how complex it can get

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,400
so yeah um one more question for you

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,400
about

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,880
um trends and predictions in cloud

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,200
native is there anything that you're

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,000
personally excited by and you think more

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,400
people should

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,640
know about uh security

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,640
i'm not from security but the number of

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,799
times you get asked about security

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
when you go beyond proving value to

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,120
getting adoption within

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,840
enterprises the first question you get

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,679
asked is

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,679
are you compliant with x y and z

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,240
so security projects and i mentioned

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,000
that we are considering using falco

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,600
so those are things that i think people

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,039
may not consider it as the first or the

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,240
second project to think about when

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,240
they're building out because you're just

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,760
trying to prove value

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,120
so kubernetes and security and cloud

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,960
native and security

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,799
will be an area which will get very hot

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,760
soon

00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:45,120
it'll get very hot and yeah well can you

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,840
tell us a little bit more about

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,640
why you're looking at falco yeah

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,600
absolutely

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,120
so when we built out our products on

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,200
cloud

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,720
we went to some enterprise customers and

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,720
they asked they would

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,320
give us this huge checklist of things we

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,159
had to pass before they would let us in

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,559
and some of these questions are like

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,960
have you had a third party consultant

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,240
certified that your product is secure

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,640
right have you done

00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,000
some kind of pen test have you done

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,159
shock to

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,600
a whole bunch of these things so some of

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
these are compliance things right you do

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,080
it at that point in time

00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,880
it doesn't mean you're doing it every

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,520
day every minute every second

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,240
so you have to be doing that it's

00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,480
somewhat in the

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,559
realm of observability and monitoring

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,240
from a security aspect

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,600
so raw metrics and monitoring

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,360
infrastructure engineers are awesome

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,600
right for debugging and things like that

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,000
security is life and death for some

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,360
companies the recent uh

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,440
you know the ransomware that happened

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,520
with this pipeline company which carries

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,679
oil physical pipelines

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,360
on the east coast of the us that was

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,520
alarming first and foremost i didn't

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,799
even know this company existed

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,960
and the ceo of the company said this we

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,480
wanted to be nameless throughout our

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
existence we never wanted to be in the

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,039
news

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,640
and they probably supply nearly fifty

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,120
percent of oil to

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,200
eastern united states forty five percent

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,480
to fifty percent

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,320
say when you build out these

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,840
technologies if they

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,120
get hacked then there is no recourse

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:19,440
other than having to pay

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,600
ransom and then trying to actively patch

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,640
holes and it's an adversarial game

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,720
you patch one something else opens up

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,760
so for us what it meant is you had to

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
get ahead of it

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,279
some of the cloud vendors have really

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,559
good technology that supports it they do

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:35,120
port scanning

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,919
they do anomaly detection but you also

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,840
go deeper

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,000
into your own use of the products and

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,679
try to find out what else is happening

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,640
so in that context we are looking into

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,200
using falco

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,760
yeah very very interesting i've

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,240
forgotten about the oil pipeline

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,159
story but yeah definitely something to

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:58,159
be concerned about

00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:02,320
um let's go talk a different topic

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,679
again um you recently or pareto say i

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,080
recently joined the

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,279
cncf end user community just a few

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,279
months ago

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,720
so how did you hear about it what got

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,000
you interested

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,720
to join there uh two main reasons

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,200
one we are using the technology piece by

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,480
piece

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,200
while not getting involved in the

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,320
community right so one of our technical

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,399
advisors said

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,919
hey you guys have to be in cncf they

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,960
look at all these other things that are

00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,320
being built

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,720
and what we are trying to build as a

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,679
knowledge network you have to do

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,720
it for a domain which is as it stands

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,760
today

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,120
taking off or in common power lines hot

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,919
and you need to be aware of what's

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,360
happening so our technical advisor said

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,399
here is the community where you need to

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,279
be there

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,880
thanks to him we got involved we started

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,600
building out our technology

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,480
as a subset of that then we broadened

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,480
the lens saying

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,159
what else are we missing that's how

00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,200
falco and other things came into the

00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,399
picture

00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,840
and then we said oh if you have to build

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,679
out a knowledge network you really need

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,679
to understand these technologies

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,360
from an abstract perspective of what's

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,960
happening what are the gaps

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,600
so that's the second reason we got

00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,640
involved

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:16,640
very cool and what do you hope to

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,799
achieve by being part of the community

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,919
yeah so our foremost objective was to

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,320
understand and build

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,840
which is the main motivation the outcome

00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,039
that you're hoping for is

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,760
if you can give out a roadmap or a

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,000
guideline

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,880
to new projects and existing projects to

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,840
say

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,960
here is a path to success and we can

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,720
help you get there

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,240
faster sooner with little to no friction

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,919
that will be awesome

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,480
if you want to provide the intelligence

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,559
for cncf based communities

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,840
to do their job better developers can

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,799
focus on building product end-user skin

00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,000
consumption and we can take care of

00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,399
let's say the community intelligence

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,600
part

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,120
at no cost to cncf that will be awesome

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,640
so we want to provide the community

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,159
intelligence to cncf

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,080
so that would be an amazing outcome for

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,039
us

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,640
super super cool i mean i really look

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,200

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,080
collaborate a little bit further sure um

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,840

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,200
