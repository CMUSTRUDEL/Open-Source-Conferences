How Magma Unleashes “Open Source Telco and 5G” Evolution - Shah Rahman, Facebook Connectivity

Magma is one of the most exciting open-source projects that is enabling the telco industry build products and solutions based on open and disaggregated software stacks. It is also empowering the ecosystem comprising startups, vendors, system integrators and mobile operators build those solutions for a wide range of use cases that are possible with 5G. See through how Magma evolves as a key component of the future networks that look much like the hyperscalers than the traditional telco networks.

hello everyone i'm sharaman from

00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,799
facebook connectivity team

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,280
and i'm here to talk to you about magma

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,320
and how it unleashes the open source 5g

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,240
and the telco movement i want to thank

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,279
you all for joining us today

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,000
i'm excited to be here thanks to linux

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,000
foundation

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,119
and kubecon organizers for arranging

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,119
such an amazing outstanding event

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,960
it feels great to be speaking after you

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,920
heard on this magma day

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,519
from amar about why we built magma the

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,000
way we did

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,079
from tina arbit and brian about how

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,640
magma fits into the end-to-end telecom

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,879
solution

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,040
along with other open source projects

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,680
from the panel of magma users

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
both end users as well as the product

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
developers

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,320
who are embedding magma into their

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,000
products and solutions and finally

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:54,160
from our amazing advocates

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,879
uh who are delivering will deliver the

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,039
lightning talks for us

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,239
following the magma dev conference back

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,719
in february

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,600
we announced the project's move to linux

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,840
foundation

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,439
as a as an independent foundation called

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,520
magma core foundation

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,119
this is the first major event covering

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,200
the magma community

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,720
as well as the ecosystem sprouting

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,119
around it

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,920
i'd like to wrap up this magma day to a

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,159
few points

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,400
that should illustrate to you how magma

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,520
can become a major catalyst to bring

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
open source telco

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,479
and 5g movement to reality with every

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,040
important player in the industry

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,640
the operators and service providers

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,600
vendors and system integrators

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,720
startups and investors and finally

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
academia

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,840
and and the public domains

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,600
so let's see how magma unleashes open

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,040
source telco

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,320
and 5g evolution let's start off with

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
defining these terms

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,600
what is open source 5g and what is open

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,159
source telco

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,159
open source is not new to telco however

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,840
it had limited success from an open

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,880
source product and commercial model

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,439
perspective

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,879
in the telco industry let's build this a

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,720
little bit further

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,120
most products in whichever industry we

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
look in today has a good percentage of

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,640
open source software

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
think about linux openstack and

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,120
kubernetes that are in almost every

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,280
product or platform you can think of

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,280
this is an open source community so i'm

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,760
sure you can totally understand that

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,319
however most products in the telecom

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,720
industry

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,239
include proprietary and open source code

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,239
that are blended together

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
and then hardened rigorously for

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,879
production and commercial readiness

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,760
the key question we want to answer is

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,440
how can we have

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,680
purely open source software-based

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,640
products be commercially ready

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,440
carrier-grade and be deployed in

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,360
production

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,720
networks by the operators or the

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
enterprises

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,160
and so that is the that is about the

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,319
open source telco movement

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,200
when we think about open source 5g we

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,440
often tend to equate telco equals 5g

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,120
while 5g originated in the telco

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,200
industry by no means it should be

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,040
limited to the industry alone

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,640
our view is that 5g movement will be

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,599
much bigger than just the telecom

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,599
industry

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,159
most pundits and researchers agree with

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,200
us therefore open source 5g will

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,440
include telecom enterprise industrial as

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,440
well as consumer use cases

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,440
we want to see how we can get open

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,640
source 5g to proliferate across

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,640
all these different markets

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,200
if you know about the telecom info

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,519
project or tip for short a project that

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,440
facebook helped launch a few years back

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,560
magma story begins with a chapter out of

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,480
tips playbook

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,840
and it's called open and disaggregated

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,440
networks

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,959
jio and rakuten the two disruptive

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,840
telecom players

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,840
in the aipac india and japan are the

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,360
poster children of this movement

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,959
and they have proven to the industry

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
that the clock is ticking against the

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,920
big vendors closed and proprietary

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,760
systems

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,360
dish wireless places open source right

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,560
on their home page including a direct

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,680
reference to oram

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,760
which is an open-run proponent of

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
group in the in the industry we know

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,280
that there has been limited success of

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,120
open telco or open source

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
software in the telecom industry at

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,319
large however

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,479
that is not an indicator of the future

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,479
by any means

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,519
it's quite the opposite and this is

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,120
precisely

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,560
why we're investing and working on

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
projects like macro

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
we remain committed to magma from

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,919
facebook connectivity

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
alongside our amazing industry group

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680
partners

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,720
namely linux foundation open source

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,040
software alliance

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,919
open interface infrastructure foundation

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,160
and the

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,160
telecom infrastructure foundation

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,240
so if we think about the global telco

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,960
networks we start to see a

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,520
a bit of a problem while access to the

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
internet

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,160
and 4g speeds continue to improve the

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,800
speed of those networks is forecast to

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,880
decline

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
in developing and emerging markets

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,479
roughly about three

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
three quarters of the uh of the world's

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,199
population

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,880
this is effectively going to create a

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,479
new kind of digital divide

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
where some parts of the population will

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,560
enjoy

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,240
rich contents like real-time video and

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,400
augmented reality

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,639
where others will not this also has

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,280
massive economic implications for

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,440
people living in developing emerging as

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,680
well as the developed countries

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,199
if we dive deeper into why the network

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
performance is going down

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
it's pretty simple to see that network

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,160
economics

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,080
we have three forces at work that are

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,280
limiting the operating profit of mobile

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,680
operators

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,800
to be below five percent in aggregate

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,199
globally

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
first data consumption is skyrocketing

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,280
in some emerging markets

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,479
we are seeing a usage of over one

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,360
gigabyte per day

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,360
which is a huge consumption the internet

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,960
is the main source of entertainment and

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:54,400
information in these markets second rpu

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,880
average revenue per user is declining

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,680
so while networks are getting loaded

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,840
people are consuming more bandwidth

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,440
more mobile operators are making less

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,160
money per user

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,960
and finally unless operators change the

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
way

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
networks are managed optics will stay

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,720
relatively flat

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,479
operational expenses that is it's not

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,360
hard to understand why these factors

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,520
combine

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,600
mobile operators are going to struggle

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,039
to invest into network capacity

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,639
that is sufficient to keep up with the

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
demand

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,840
this is where magma mission kicks in to

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,160
figure out

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,960
how to dramatically reduce the network

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,639
tco

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
specifically from the operational

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,479
expense standpoint for the mobile

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
operators and service providers

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,720
and we believe we can do that by

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,280
enabling the open source telco movement

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
where the operators are no longer afraid

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
to deploy

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,919
open source software stacks in their

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
production networks and by catalyzing an

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,680
open source 5g movement

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
across all types of cellular mobile

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,759
networks for example the operator

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,639
networks public networks private

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,199
networks

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,800
decentralized networks as well as

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,800
non-terrestrial or the satellite

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,560
networks

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,319
before we go into the details we draw an

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,880
important parallel between the adoption

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,520
of

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,440
open source in the enterprise versus in

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,199
the telco space that we have seen over

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,440
the past decade or so

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
on the left hand side column we see the

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,240
evolution of

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,800
open source in the enterprise space over

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
the past 10 years or so

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,960
it's been triggered by linux that is now

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,720
in every part of the software industry

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,160
and this community should be proud that

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,199
we're in the part of this linux

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,319
foundation

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,440
right and and probably the um

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,240
you know in the so uh prolific uh

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,720
in the industry uh the enterprises that

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,840
that

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,919
you know we heard the phrase that

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,160
software sitting the war and this is

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,000
probably more appropriate to say

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
from this perspective that open source

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,759
is eating software right

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,360
the window of opportunity to disrupt the

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,280
telco industry

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
especially with open source project as

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,360
we see on the right hand column

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,639
is the next three to five years if you

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,039
think why

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,120
there are early indicators that show the

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,000
most disruptive operators over the last

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,919
few years

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
have been the prolific users of open

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,720
source software across the entire telco

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,360
stack

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,199
from ram to core to the operational and

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
business support systems

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
as the traditional operators start

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,680
embracing open and disaggregated

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,080
technologies

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
in ram and front-end part of the network

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,440
we would like to see them adopt

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,919
open source stacks like magma in the

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,280
core and increasingly on the operational

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,319
business support system

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,000
on the back end part of the network so

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,959
let's look at this a little bit deeper

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
between grand

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,120
and the and the core and we want to draw

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,279
that distinction with

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,399
the the two core part of the telco

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,919
networks today

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,839
a coordinate proc is naturally

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,959
disaggregated and acts as the back end

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,800
of the network

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
we've seen strong open ground movement

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,000
on the rand side

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
and many large operators are starting to

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,120
run trials

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,880
with various open run vendors as we

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,360
speak

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
the core itself lends to a single stack

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,399
implementation

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,040
as it's distributed over different parts

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,000
of the network running at a very

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
highly distributed system therefore it's

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,880
a natural

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,720
open source fit that can become the base

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,200
implementation to be leveraged

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,160
in many commercial use cases network

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,800
core

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
follows the mantra of building build

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
wants

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,440
enhance many times and thereby support

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,640
all the use cases

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,959
you can this is the same mantra that we

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,920
are

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,880
asking all developers out out there to

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,279
look

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,200
uh and where they're you know where and

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
how they can leverage magma stack to

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,519
build

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,240
different network applications for the

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,360
telcos as well as the emerging five use

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,000
cases

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,120
so i i'll give you some examples uh

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,640
private networks

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,200
like lte and 5g agent iot networks

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,760
network or service convergence network

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,760
connectivity as a service

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
enterprise networks in the post-covered

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,600
world which we know the world is fast

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
changing and there is a lot more need

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,640
for

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,440
higher bandwidth lower latency a better

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,240
connectivity

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,240
improved networks and so on and last but

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,640
not the least consumer applications with

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
rich

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
and multimedia experiences such as

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,200
augmented and

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,200
virtual reality

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,240
so the evolution of the network core has

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,440
been through the physical

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,920
to virtual to cloudified all in a very

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,839
vendor

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,600
and infrastructure locked way 2008 to 14

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,399
was the time of the physical packet

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,040
course

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,680
uh so basically prior to 2014 between

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,279
2014 and 2019 the virtual pocket score

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:38,800
are known as the

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,920
vapc um saw a lot of deployments and

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,079
and rollouts 2020 plus as of last year

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,160
most of the cloud native cores for both

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,839
4g and 5g networks are

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,760
starting to turn us to show up in

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,079
different parts of the world

00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,040
when 3gpp release 15 was ratified in

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,440
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,200
it was during the virtualization era and

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,600
missed several important characteristics

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,519
from the future several networks

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,279
therefore a clear path for the network

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,839
core stack that is developed and

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,000
deployed

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,920
in a fully vendor access and

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,279
infrastructure agnostic manner

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,240
was one of the characteristics that

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,360
release 16 and onwards are working to

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,279
catch up

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,120
going forward we see a need for a

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,920
hundred percent api driven

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,959
cloud-native and multi-tenant core stack

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,800
that converges

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
all kinds of access networks not just

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,000
accelerator but wi-fi

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:31,040
satellite private networks cbrs and

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,880
shared spectrum networks as well and we

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,160
shall see our journey to date

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,839
uh basically and you have seen how we

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,000
have arrived there with magma

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,240
we see the future of network bright with

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,480
an open architecture and an

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,440
open source software stack and we like

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,440
to call that magma

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
moving along as we carry forward on the

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
path

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,519
of magma evolution we follow a model of

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
commercialization

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,320
that is based on a model from peter

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,920
living of anderson horowitz

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
the model covers how a single open

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,760
source project can turn into

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,600
a single commercial product we have

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,920
modified the model for a single project

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,839
supporting multiple commercial offerings

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,079
thereby building an ecosystem and

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,920
boutique industry around the project

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,440
this industry is precisely the open

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,600
source telco and 5g

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
opportunity space where you the

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,880
developers

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,959
can develop products services and

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,279
applications for your users

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,440
tomorrow and finally obtain customers

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,760
the day after

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,959
this is magma's evolution path and based

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,160
on the huge traction of 1500 plus active

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,800
members

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,920
in the community over the matter of a

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,959
few months

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,560
and 250 plus active contributors we

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,760
already have achieved the project

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,440
community fit

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,240
we have far exceeded the critical

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,120
community mass across lf oif

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,800
osa and tip industry groups over the

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,360
next 12 to 18 months

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,560
we expect to see many telco and 5g use

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,639
cases

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,240
addressed by the users of magma and not

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,760
just the developers

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,079
build products and services that are

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,079
commercially viable and start moving

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,399
into initial trials and pilots depending

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,240
on the target market and segment

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,839
this is how magma is the essential

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,160
product market fit

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,519
over the time period over the next two

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,360
to three years

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,519
we expect to see tens of customers

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,600
running production workloads based on

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,399
magma-based products and services

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,680
which is beginning of the of the

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,399
commercial journey

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,040
where users are able to build viable

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,680
businesses

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,360
with their customers this is a magma

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,160
achieved the value market fit in the

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,040
industry

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,880
for years to come and match precisely

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,720
the predicted open source adoption in

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,680
the telco industry and 5g

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:52,000
that we that we showed earlier

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,600
we want to see a little bit deeper into

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,519
what those opportunities in the open

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,320
source telco and 5g would look like

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,920
and how magma really underpins some of

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,639
these opportunities

00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,160
first and foremost magma stack has three

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,480
distinct value props

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,920
that we see as a substrate offered to

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
different commercialization and

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,519
monetization models

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,680
by no means these are the only models

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,279
that exist and there may be others

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,680
these are the illustrative ones that

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,440
would like to highlight for our audience

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,720
who can think of how to take advantage

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,279
of these opportunities

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
the first model is more traditional that

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,240
focuses on

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,760
enhancing magma and offering support

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,600
support and services around

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,680
around magma for the operators and the

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
enterprises the model is called the red

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,120
hat model

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,440
this model is leveraged uh by a few

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,000
startups each targeting a different

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,600
market segments today the second model

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,519
is more like the pivot model

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,760
where magma is leveraged as a stack

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,760
however is used in a very different

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,760
network connectivity use case

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,680
this model is also used by a few

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:57,040
startups developing radio

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,040
backhaul and iot use cases for example

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,279
the third one is around the service

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,920
model where magma is offered as a

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,639
service

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,800
taking advantage of multi-tenancy this

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,760
model is most suitable for cloud and

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,399
edge platforms

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,720
that already have hosting tooling and

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,040
commercials in place for their customers

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
and the prospect prospective customers

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,920
as well

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,199
this model is in pursuit with major

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,959
cloud and edge platforms as we speak

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,399
the fourth one the final and the fourth

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,160
one is the breakout model

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,399
where magma stack is leveraged for

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,079
non-network use case mostly for consumer

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,480
or enterprise applications

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,399
this model is most conducive for open

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,279
source 5g to bring the power

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,959
and advances of 5g technology outside of

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,399
the telco industry

00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,079
there are several startups that are

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
working on developing this app

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,320
and developing applications based on

00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,320
this model

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,120
before we look into the specific

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,519
audience segment i want to wrap up by

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,199
just reiterating and sharing that 5g is

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,600
such a hot space now

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,480
and there are so many opportunities up

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,800
for grabs

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,240
speedy execution will likely determine

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,880
your startup or company's

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,839
ultimate fate in this space so avoid the

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,320
speed bumps

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,120
bypass the bottlenecks bring your speed

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,279
buyers to us

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,720
and build your business whether it is

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,720
connectivity focused

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,360
or the latest or greatest sas

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,320
application in the network and telecom

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,480
industry or the seamless network

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
enterprise networks for the postcode

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,920
world

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,560
or the emerging consumer experiences you

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,440
can build

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,199
any of these on top of magma stack we

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,839
have a fantastic community

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:35,279
and we are very glad to be here with the

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,759
broader linux

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,279
community here and we're fortunate to

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
have the support from

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,240
uh all of our uh um you know key

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,600
advocates from linux foundation to oif

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,199
and and osa and and in many ways we're

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,120
actually unique to have been

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,079
able to bring multiple industry groups

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,240
together with a shared and common goal

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,720
the opportunity space is very large and

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:02,560
it will only be growing over the years

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,160
there is no excuse me reason to

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,000
think about competition which will be a

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,600
non-issue when you find your perfect

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
niche

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,319
magma reduces complexity of the space

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,439
reduces the high entry barrier that is

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,079
commonly known for

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:16,880
working with telco applications and so

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,640
on

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,959
and unleashes different opportunities

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,360
for entrepreneurs of all sizes

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,959
all types of all parts of the world next

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,480
few slides i'm just going to share some

00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,039
specific information

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,960
tailored for audiences with this vision

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,960
vendors and system integrators are one

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
of the most important stakeholders for

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,080
magma

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,960
as they bring both developers and users

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,480
to the equation

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,640
however they usually don't run their own

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,679
networks if we think about just 5g

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,720
technology market

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,400
the size is a trillion dollar market in

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
a matter of few years and growing over

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,960
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,320
year-over-year these estimates are

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,240
conservative as several new

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,600
opportunities are not yet factored in

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,760
for example decentralized or

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,160
non-terrestrial market that are enabled

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,760
by 3gbp 18 and onwards

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,600
the key thing for vendors and system

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,240
integrators is to focus on building the

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,960
development

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,559
teams teams with skill developers who

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,480
can leverage magma stack

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,720
develop products and services following

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,880
one of the models i described earlier

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,320
and once you have built the critical

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,320
in-house expertise

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,400
align with your open source and business

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,520
strategies then lean on the thriving

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,200
magma community

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,440
it is likely going to be a winning

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,960
formula in the post-covered world when

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
creativity challenges are

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
simply on the rise

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,679
next is operators and service providers

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
and the most significant players

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,240
telecom industry who hold ultimately

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
around the networks based on magma stack

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,360
and components

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,360
it goes without saying how the open

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,000
source telco and 5g movement wouldn't be

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,679
possible without them fully engaged in

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,200
the biggest reason for operators and

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,240
service providers to consider open

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,559
source 5g

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
is to avoid vendor locking that's much

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,160
easier said than done

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,919
this requires busting several meats that

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,760
have severely impacted

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,320
open source adoption at large in this

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,919
industry this also requires embracing

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,280
the true benefits

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,200
of open source 5g in in action in their

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,760
own hands whenever possible

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
the skyrocketing data demands from the

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,679
hungry applications

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,080
will slowly and but surely in a way

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,320
operator revenues and profits

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,919
therefore multiple opportunities the

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,799
emerging use cases that service

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,919
providers can

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,160
unlock based on based on magma

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,080
the next is startups and investors one

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
of the most interesting segments i'm

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,120
excited about

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,520
15 startups that are already building

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:39,440
their products based on magma stack

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,200
they're diverse and and come from

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,200
all different value market opportunities

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,840
we talked about their networking

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,000
consumer enterprise and sas adoption

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,360
that we see across this amazing cohort

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,039
of startups

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,720
and you can see some of the testimonies

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,559
from three of our

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,720
key startups here and you've heard from

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,200
them earlier today as well

00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,840
the key for these startups is the ttm

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,159
advantage

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,400
the time to market which is everything

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,200
so you can focus building on your

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,600
secret sauce and not the table stacks

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,640
that often startups with

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,720
with a small and lean team and and that

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,039
that is often designed by the large

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,200
companies so that startups are are not

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:22,000
able to

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,640
for the success the simple ask is to

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,640
consider

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,679
investing in these startups and crack

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,400
the meet and

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,760
emit around the space complexity limited

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,159
exit opportunities

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,000
or or capital intensive nature of

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,679
telecom startups

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,640
i like to stress that 5g is not all

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,760
about telco and 5g open source 5g

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,960
is the opportunity space that is a big

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,559
proof point for that

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,159
consider reviewing these startups and

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,679
investing in them and i'm speaking to

00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,080
the investors out there

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,520
demi and public domains are the r d arm

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,960
of magma movement

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,120
where we are working with several

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,320
universities through both funded and

00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,679
collaborative projects that are

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,320
leveraging magma

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,200
and advancing open source technologies

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,799
these are

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,200
there are new network models new

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,039
operational models emerging technologies

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,679
like ai and ml blockchain

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,799
data science hyper convergence analytics

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,320
and insights

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,080
that are being developed in order to

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,159
improve the future networks

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,400
open source stacks like magma enables

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,520
advanced research in newer and easier

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,559
ways that

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,520
simply wasn't possible before last but

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,440
not the least

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,960
there are multiple public domain and

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,919
government projects that are leveraging

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,000
magma stack

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:37,039
as part of an open source telecom stack

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,039
you saw earlier today

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,360
it has been a pleasure to present magma

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,120
stack as the key enabler of open source

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,679
telco and 5g today

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,200
and i look forward to seeing you at

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,640
github.com

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:55,280
magma connect with us on slack

00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,840
check us out on magmacore.org the

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,960
foundation that's just been established

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,360
and

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,720
here we are just the initial set of uh

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,760
pr that we are

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,840
um very lucky to have received um and

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,559
and people went as far as calling the

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,960
open source magma to be the 5gs linux

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,679
how well can i kind of connect the dots

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,880
here

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,919

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,559
unleash those powerful open source 5g

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,600
and telco opportunities with that i'd
