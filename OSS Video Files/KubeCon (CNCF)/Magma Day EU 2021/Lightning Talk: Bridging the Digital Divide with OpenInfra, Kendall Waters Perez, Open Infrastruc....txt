hi my name is kendall waters-perez

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,399
and i am a community partnerships

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,120
manager at the open infrastructure

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,960
foundation

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,280
and a community manager for the magma

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
project i spend my day working with open

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,000
infrastructure

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,080
that's infrastructure powered by open

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,880
source open infrastructure

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,640
or open infra is more than just the code

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,160
it's also a global community

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
writing and deploying open source

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,680
software for infrastructure

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,920
it's a movement that was started with

00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,760
openstack a decade ago and now we host

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,720
several open source projects including

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,559
openstack

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
we are participating in the new magma

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,800
foundation as a member of the governing

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,160
board

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,920
and we support cross-community

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,280
collaboration with projects like

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,600
kubernetes ceph and many more

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,440
at the open infra foundation we build

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,640
communities who write software that runs

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,160
in production

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
i've really enjoyed collaborating with

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,840
the magma community around organizing

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,160
the annual magma developers conference

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,320
that attracted over 800 participants

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,320
uncovering production case studies and

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719
growing the community overall

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,520
it's just been incredible watching the

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
contributors

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:06,080
build technology that connects people in

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,240
tribal nations in north america

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,000
through mural net royal communities in

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,200
wisconsin through y connect

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,119
in kenya through brick these use cases

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,920
are great example of how magma bridges

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,159
the divide

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,479
in an effort to bring more people online

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
to a faster internet

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,159
every week the global open

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
infrastructure community is tuning into

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,520
openm4 live

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,400
an online series showcasing open source

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,799
case studies

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,000
demos software release road maps and

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,479
cross community

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
integration stories you can join us

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,439
later this week

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,200
on thursday's episode to learn how open

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,479
source software for infrastructure like

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,240
magma and openstack

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,159
are solving problems around global

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,640
connectivity

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,720
we can't do this alone now is a great

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,960
time to participate in bringing more

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,960
open source software into production

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,119
join me and the 100 other magma

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,759

as we build more communities who write

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,680
software that runs in production
