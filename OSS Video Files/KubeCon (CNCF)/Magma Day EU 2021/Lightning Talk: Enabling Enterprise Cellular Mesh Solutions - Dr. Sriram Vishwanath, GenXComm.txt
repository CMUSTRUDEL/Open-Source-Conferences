Lightning Talk: Enabling Enterprise Cellular Mesh Solutions - Dr. Sriram Vishwanath, GenXComm

In this talk, Sriram will describe an end-to-end enterprise cellular mesh network solution using magma as the core. By combining GenXComm's interference cancellation solution with the CUPS magma core, we can deliver a low-latency, scalable, mesh solution for enterprises and operators in the CBRS spectrum as well as other spectra.

hello everybody this is sriram from

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,040
gen x.com uh glad to be part of magma

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,559
day this is

00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,960
um really good because of uh

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,639
our interest in magma so thank you for

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,359
having us

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,960
um i'm the president of gen x com inc

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,800
and today i'll be speaking about

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,840
enabling enterprise

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,880
cellular mesh networking and the

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,840
emphasis on cellular mesh so 4g 5g mesh

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,760
solutions for the enterprise using a

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,760
combination of our technology and magma

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
so let me quickly introduce what we do

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,559
and talk about how we can combine

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,239
what magma has done in terms of a

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,920
control user plane separated

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,440
core with a mesh radio access network

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
mesh ran to produce a unique

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,840
mesh network overall in hardware and

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,920
software

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,039
so what do we do we enable secure and

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,480
private mesh

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
4g and 5g networks so what genexcom does

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
in a nutshell

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,200
is to enable a private network in a box

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,520
that's entered and integrated

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,520
the network is much more scalable

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,600
overall not just

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
better but faster and more resilient

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,400
using a mesh network

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,920
this is an in-band solid mesh so unlike

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,360
what you might think this is not an

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,560
out-of-band different frequency

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,720
different time

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,640
this is the same band specifically if

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,759
you want to think of it as band 48

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
or cbrs or n78 as the case may be you

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,960
can do a

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,200
band 48 mesh network using this

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,360
technology

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,680
and by meshing it mean true meshing that

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,880
means you can go multi-hop you can go

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,119
multiple nodes all talk to each other in

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,360
a true mesh network fashion

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,759
in cellular 4g 5g with a combination of

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,399
what magma has achieved and what we

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,680
can do with our ram solution at gen xcom

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
you can combine that with all the

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,159
virtualized software not just in terms

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,960
of

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,280
magma but also in terms of overall eibs

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,880
network management eib self organizing

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,399
network or so on

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,440
to produce an overall urlc embb

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,640
solution for networking

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,080
our overall main goal here is to enable

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,959
5g networks

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,879
so anybody can go about enabling one it

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,720
can be handyman installed or ultimately

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,720
grandma installed as the case may be

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,800
so what's unique about this platform you

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,319
have

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,040
2gen xcom a very unique factor is the

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
patented

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,599
inference cancelling meshing solution

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
which includes open ram

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:44,480
small cells and what are called iab on

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,720
integrated access and backhaul nodes

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,519
so on the hardware side you have a

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,599
unique

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,440
indifference-free meshing capability

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,840
with open run architecture

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,920
where you can integrate sims and enable

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,280
uh overall roaming on a

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,000
dual esem uh based system

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,879
and the software side essentially by

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,239
combining magma based control plane user

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,760
plane separated

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
architecture you can enable the core to

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,959
live

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,040
as close to the hardware as possible

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,519
while enabling the overall network

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,280
to be self-organizing and be managed

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,680
using machine learning

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,280
such a network has the lowest reliable

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
latency

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,799
as well as the guaranteed latency as

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,400
well as the highest reliability because

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,840
of its mesh architecture

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,680
and also has the lowest total cost of

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,319
ownership

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,760
what else gen xcom achieved with our

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,640
technology we've enabled influence

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,440
cancellation based meshing

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,319
we have multiple contracts i've delved a

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,959
project product in 2019 uh

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,080
two years ago and now we are delivering

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,120
more products

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,959
uh across industry 4.0 segments

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,640
today we're working across five states

00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,200
