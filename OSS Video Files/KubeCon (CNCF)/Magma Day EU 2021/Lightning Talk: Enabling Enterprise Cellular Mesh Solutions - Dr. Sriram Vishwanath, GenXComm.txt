Lightning Talk: Enabling Enterprise Cellular Mesh Solutions - Dr. Sriram Vishwanath, GenXComm

In this talk, Sriram will describe an end-to-end enterprise cellular mesh network solution using magma as the core. By combining GenXComm's interference cancellation solution with the CUPS magma core, we can deliver a low-latency, scalable, mesh solution for enterprises and operators in the CBRS spectrum as well as other spectra.
