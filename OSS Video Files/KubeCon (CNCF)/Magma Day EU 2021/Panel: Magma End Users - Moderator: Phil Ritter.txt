hello everyone and welcome to our panel

00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,440
on

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,160
uh magma and how it's being used in

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,960
various businesses and various

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,559
deployments

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:18,240
today we have a

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:21,680
group of six leaders in the industry

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,240
who have all found new and novel ways to

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,039
use magma to build business or build

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,039
product

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,560
i'm going to do a brief introduction and

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,000
i'll let them

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,719
tell their a little bit about their

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
story uh we have with us today ayush

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,239
sharma

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,399
who's the founder and ceo of moto genie

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,320
uh sasha dech who's telecom

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,320
lead or a development lead in the

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,160
telecom and connectivity space at

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,399
deutsche telecom

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,320
mario triggs the ceo of ceo of mural net

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,360
jim maynes the ceo of shoelace wireless

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,800
boris rensky founder and ceo of

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,760
freedomfi

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,079
and jesse ratch the cto north america of

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,719
buy sells who's representing a user

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,000
story

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,799
from a company called we connect so i

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,840
want to start this

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,040
off with the key question why

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,320
mag what about magma compelled you

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,280
to choose it to build your business or

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,840
build a business

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,720
around it i don't have any particular

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
order for this

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
i'll i'll just tag our speakers as i

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
have them listed

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
so ayush why don't you start us off sure

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,280
um thanks phil

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,960
so moto genie is in the business of fan

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
and audience engagement

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,799
so delivering low latency immersive and

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,520
engaging experiences

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,520
requires both real-time and predictable

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,759
responses from the infrastructure

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
so one of the key component of this

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,320
infrastructure is packet core

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
and today most of these packet core

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,119
solutions that are available in the

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,240
market

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,119
do not offer that flexibility

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,680
exposure and resource control that is

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,479
needed to deliver those experiences

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,600
magma enables those modern day

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,000
networking

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
uh requirements without being tied to a

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,840
specific vendor in a

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,040
more agnostic way it provides

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,160
programmability openness disaggregation

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,720
it is developed and and and and by

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,200
the community and for the community so

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,680
so this is a perfect fit for

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
motogeni to leverage magma and

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,560
contribute back

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,040
and and hopefully it will lead to wider

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,480
and mass adoption

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,519
thanks ayush so sasha it's interesting

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,280
to see

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,440
a very large mmo operator

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,640
taking an interest in a product like

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
magma this is not

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,800
a typical thing that the major network

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,800
operators

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,319
typically do and i wonder if you could

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,800
tell us a little bit about what you're

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,239
doing

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,800
and how you've come to join into the

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,159
magma

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,200
experience yeah of course

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,480
um i think it all started with the

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,440
tip wi-fi program so um

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,159
i'm i'm doing wi-fi business for quite a

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,519
while

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,000
and um yeah we had this idea

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,239
of bringing together the data that we're

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,120
collecting from various places into

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,480
one place where it actually makes sense

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
and we can

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,400
derive some kind of network intelligence

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,400
out of it and i think um

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
by the time we met shaw and all of the

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,599
team of the of of magma

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,640
and yeah those guys were really really

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,080
amazing and

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,720
um you know we we operate this

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,360
more or less always look from uh from uh

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,760
from a

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,400
telco perspective to the problems and

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,560
it's

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,159
it's it's very interesting to see people

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
looking from the other side looking more

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,280
from the i.t

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,879
side to the problem and and solving it

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,760
the different way as we would

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,720
uh naturally do it in our world and so

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
yeah this is a

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,159
is a learning and understanding

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
experience

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,640
and also um giving us some new insights

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,879
how we could also solve

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,120
problems how we could tackle problems

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,400
differently and yeah i think um

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,360
also for the for the disaggregation and

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,239
software softwarization of the telco

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,880
industry

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,359
it's it's quite necessary that we join

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,400
open projects that we work together as a

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,080
community

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,560
and that we understand that something

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,759
like magma can only help all of us in

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,960
the industry also

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,800
us mnos to get better and faster time to

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,800
markets and reduce our tco

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,840
thank you sasha that's that's actually

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,440
uh very intriguing to hear how you're

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,600
seeing magma as a target to help

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,600
reduce the cost of ownership which is

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,639
really a major focus

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,440
of what the project is all about

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,759
marielle you are working in a space that

00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,800
is

00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,720
especially fascinating to me and

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
serving a community that has been

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,440
largely ignored

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
by the large mobile operators or where

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,639
it hasn't been economic

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,240
for the mobile operators to bring

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,960
service to them tell us a little bit

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,960
about

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,000
what you're doing and how magma has

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,759
helped you support your community

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,639
sure thanks phillip um my name is

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,280
marielle i run a non-profit mural that

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,720
and we work with the native communities

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,919
in order to control their internet

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,600
access future

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,440
and like you said for a lot of our role

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,639
partners there is no return on

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,680
investment so

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,440
when it comes to how they're going to

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
get connected it's they're going to have

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,360
to connect themselves

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,039
in 2017 we started our first pilot

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,600
and i believe the first field deployment

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,039
of magma with the havasupai tribe at the

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
bottom of the grand canyon

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,680
so this is a location that's the most

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,120
remote community in the lower 48 states

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,199
and uh with the

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
the tech core that we had uh it was a

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,360
buy sales equipment

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,720
and it was uh the first magma core and

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,919
we were able to get the

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,479
broadband to the bottom of the grand

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,000
canyon within um half a day's work and

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,600
fifteen thousand dollars

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,120
so what this allowed for is for

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
broadband in a place that never

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
had it and that's the important part of

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,120
it and why we've definitely stuck with

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600
magma

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,160
um we are working with communities to

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,639
really

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
uh realize their vision of how they want

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,919
to connect to the internet and part of

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,440
that is the formation

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,600
of figuring out how you want to connect

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,400
for the internet so in

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,319
2017 and 2018 we did a lot of pilot uh

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,360
deployments but 2019

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,120
um well mostly 2020

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,960
with kovid we ended up deploying a lot

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,240
of emergency networks so what magma

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,720
allowed us to do

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,720
is quickly and cheaply get people online

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,479
fast within the tribal communities

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,840
and every single one of our emergency

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
and pilot deployments

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
grew into full deployment or are growing

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
into full deployments um

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
we are helping with over probably around

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,880
two dozen networks right now

00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
and we have over a hundred clients that

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,400
we consult with

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,240
so what i see in magma is this

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,919
flexibility of both

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,800
the hardware that it can work with it's

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,840
agnostic there but also that you can run

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,800
of a core on the cloud that's completely

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,120
and easy to

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
um support or if they're more concerned

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,919
about data sovereignty

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,000
and want to have complete control their

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,319
network it can be on a local core

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,120
it can change and grow as they need and

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,759
what magma allows mural net to do

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,960
is to be the support that is necessary

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,800
at the different phases

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,080
as the tribes grow their networks and

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,560
their network vision

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:35,360
so that they can eventually realize um

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,120
and control their internet future so

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,840
that's what i love about magma

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,800
the flexibility the fact that it's uh

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,360
tech

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,879
agnostic and open to almost everything

00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,319
it seems and uh

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:51,440
that it allows for for our

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,240
clients to grow thanks marielle

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,840
i really appreciate that and i think

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,280
what i want to do is

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,680
next go to jesse and you have actually

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,280
very similar story but a very different

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,680
kind of community tell us

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:08,160
a little bit about what happened with we

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,120
connect and how magma was able to allow

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,680
you to

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,800
to do a deployment in a place that was

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,199
underserved or unserved

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,440
right basically yeah y connect uh is

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,960
just one of you know the the many the

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,680
the thousands of

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,479
the wisc operators uh within the united

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,360
states

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,319
um so yeah it's always been a challenge

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,759
the adoption

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,320
and deployment of an lte or soon 5g

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,959
network

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
it's always been a very difficult

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:38,159
adoption

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,680
and the goal from the buy sales end has

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,560
always been to

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,839
make the product uh more wi-fi like and

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,040
enigma

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,240
really helps in that side of things

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
because reducing the complexity of the

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,360
actual deployment

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,440
and having a simple gateway that could

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,680
be installed at each site

00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,839
while supporting a lot of the feature

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,600
sets uh that are required for a fixed

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,240
wireless operator

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
so for example the layer 2 bridging

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,640
functionality

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,320
within magma that was added um really

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,240
makes it more wi-fi like

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,760
you know to the point they can use their

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,920
own you know ghp

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,040
server to do the assigning the addresses

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,200
so

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,800
bridging that technical gap and

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,640
complexity that is

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,040
normally inherent with an lcd core

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,680
that that really uh supports the

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,880
adoption

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,440
of these networks but of course the

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,200
the cost is also a huge factor and by

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,399
having the solution that's

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,560
widely available in open source space

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,760
plus having uh you know the companies in

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,720
this case require connect like freedom 5

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,160
commercializing the solution having very

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,600
affordable gateways that could be

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,240
deployed

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,680
at each power site um you know that

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,959
makes this technology

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,959
uh available and a possibility

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,320
uh to deploy in these ultra role

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,959
situations

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,519
to the point where subscriber counts

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,200
could be

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,800
less than 10 and you can still make some

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,760
roi sense uh you know for those uh

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,760
kind of coverage areas

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,200
thank you jesse and and jim

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
shoelace is taking a little bit of a

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,240
different approach and working with the

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,680
magma project

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,640
to help improve uh wireless service

00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,240
overall

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,480
tell us a little bit about that and how

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
the magma team has helped you in that

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
effort

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,480
sure thanks phil and also working

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,839
heavily with uh

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,839
my buddy there sasha um so macma is a

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,279
critical opponent for us to enable the

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,079
adoption and deployment of our

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,880
technology

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:49,279
and what we focus on is the market

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,120
challenge of insatiable mobile internet

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,480
demand you know as fast as an operator

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,880
builds out a network

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,640
it gets consumed which creates a lot of

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,320
stress on their infrastructure

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,560
and business models and that was fine

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,680
when used operators are going from 2g

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,920
to 3g 4g and so on

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,320
where they can actually make more money

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,000
but not only you know 5g and 6g becomes

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,120
challenging especially when unlimited

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
plans

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,360
so um and then in the oven of uh five

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,800
dollar unlimited plants in some part of

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,320
the country you know you know we have to

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,839
look at different models i think

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
one of the things sasha said that you

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
know our approach is is that

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,200
we look at the world differently so

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,839
instead of looking from the network out

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,320
we look from uh the user of the device

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,560
back

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,399
and there's plenty of spectrum and if

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,000
you can intelligently harvest it

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,760
so we've developed um client technology

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,680
that's multi-path traffic steering and

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,839
switching and aggregation so we can

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,839
take advantage of any available and

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,640
accessible licensed and unlicensed

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
spectrum

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,120
to provide great connectivity experience

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,680
at affordable cost for operator

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,240
so uh what magma key component that

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,200
offered is we need to make it easy

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
for this capacity whether it's wi-fi or

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,720
private lte

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
to be augmented into the network so we

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,000
can leverage both of those spectrum

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,639
and then be able to intelligently steer

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,720
that traffic and the other key thing

00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,760
you know it's been invaluable for us uh

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,519
for magma

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:15,200
is that it brings us to a wealth of

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,360
innovative partners i mean boris has

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,000
helped us i think we've

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,399
obviously sasha but countless other ones

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,160
that

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,920
you know trying to do it alone yourself

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,680
you can't do it so we can accelerate

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,360
this adoption again deployment

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,160
of providing this additional capacity

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,160
throughout the network

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,160
thanks thanks jim and i

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,160
think it's actually really valuable

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,639
insight to talk about how

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,519
the community environment that an open

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,320
source project

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:44,800
like magma is able to bring to have

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,959
people

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
willing to help each other along their

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,040
journey so boris i've left you for last

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,000
but i think you're in a unique position

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,399
among this group

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,680
because you've been helping many of the

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,760
players through

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
uh freedom fi and the work that you've

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,240
done as you

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,440
take magma and build an ecosystem of

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,120
services and product packaging

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,440
around it tell us a little bit about

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,760
your journey and how magma's

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,480
been helpful to you and why you see that

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,720
as

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
a compelling story to build a business

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,800
around

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,800
sure phil thanks so

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,279
at freedom 5 we basically as you phil

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,639
pointed out

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,200
um deliver a commercial distribution of

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,120
magma

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:38,160
so magma is our bread and butter

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,360
and the journey

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:44,399
has started actually

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,440
probably two and a half years ago even

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,720
before

00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:51,839
magma was open sourced so

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,680
most of the company dna

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,760
the team and myself included comes from

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,240
basically enterprise open source prior

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,560
to freedom fi

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,480
many of us at freedom five worked at the

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
company called mirantis which focused on

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,279
productizing

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,639
open source cloud infrastructure and

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,120
already at that time um we had quite a

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,240
bit of exposure to the telecom industry

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:21,360
because our product at marantis was

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,560
used as an nfv infrastructure

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,000
for many of the telecom operators

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,199
and myself and many of my colleagues

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,399
had kind of the front row seat watching

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:37,519
the disruption that open source

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,399
brought to the enterprise infrastructure

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,639
space

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
um and at the same time we're always

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,639
extremely puzzled

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,560
how little of it actually percolated

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,120
into the higher layers

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,720
of the telecom infrastructure around the

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,560
network core

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,120
so um speaking about you know

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,079
what what we at freedom fire are excited

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
about vis-a-vis

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,360
magma first of all we're very much

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,839
excited that all of you guys are excited

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,199
um because it's a testament to you know

00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,480
us kind of being

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,839
on the right track to an extent but more

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:17,279
generally speaking

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,760
i personally think that um

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
you know there are certain types of

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,639
software

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,920
in general that tend to land themselves

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:30,800
better to an open source

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,600
kind of a community driven development

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,279
model

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,639
and those are the types of software that

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,000
tend to be kind of an implementation of

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,800
a lower layer

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,160
like generic functionality that can be

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,959
used ubiquitously

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,320
across all users so like operating

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,560
systems

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,839
or databases or container orchestrators

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,560
or even like web servers are all good

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,440
examples

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,040
of that where we have seen like open

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,160
source just come in

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,759
and dominate and if you look at uh

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,639
you know the enabler of the um

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,759
you know telecom 5g connectivity the

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,480
network core

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,680
particularly the lower layers of the

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,920
network core

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,759
uh that deal with the data plane

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,759
components or user plane

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,279
as uh you know people in the telecom

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,720
industry call that

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,639
um they very much resemble um

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,759
you know that of like you know an

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,720
operating system

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,519
or like uh you know like an enterprise

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,199
sdm

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,800
where we know historically open source

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,279
is dominated and

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:40,959
i think that the magma to date is

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,120
probably

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,240
a project with the strongest community

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,240
momentum to

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,560
implement the you know 5g telecom

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,079
network core specifically the data plane

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,639
components of it

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:56,000
um in an open source kind of a you know

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,920
community fashion

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,120
under the linux foundation umbrella

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,320
which we believe

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,319
is kind of a winning recipe and

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
as a company betting on it and betting

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,240
on the fact that

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,919
magma will effectively become um you

00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,120
know the linux of network core

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,760
down the road thanks boris

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,640
that that's actually a very keen insight

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,400
on the

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
types of projects that tend to be

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,039
successful or dominant

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,919
open source projects and how a project

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:27,280
like magma

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,319
fits into that for the rest of this i

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,640
don't want to

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,720
direct questions throughout the team but

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,679
i'll just toss a couple of questions out

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,000
and see

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,919
if anyone wants to take a shot at

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,039
answering them and how you can build on

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,280
that

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,000
tell me a little bit about what your

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,520
team is actually doing with magma right

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,160
now and how

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,640
uh this recent transition to a fully

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,440
open

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,760
community-based product and project and

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,559
support from the linux foundation

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,559
is helping us achieve those those

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,200
objectives

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:07,600
i'll take a shot at it thanks

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,320
yeah so i mean for any startup to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,880
succeed

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,840
and thrive it's very important to

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,280
innovate

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,000
um you know at speed and in a frugal

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,160
manner

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,120
so um how we are leveraging magma

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,799
and how it is helping us um in all these

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,160
three elements is first is

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,600
frugality right so we are able to use

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,840
uh you know obviously the the

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,200
the commodity hardware here so that

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,200
enables us

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:42,400
to uh to have a frugal systems

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,640
built and second is

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,240
innovation and boris touched upon it and

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,000
we're working with boris

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,799
uh on several you know uh aspects of

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,320
of enabling some of those features and

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:57,600
he talked about

00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,880
very important function which is very

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,520
critical and vital for the overall

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,160
solution we are offering to our sports

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,559
fans

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,559
and and and audience engagement

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,400
people who where where we engage with

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,840
the audience

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,600
so um and those are decoupling of

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,280
folding plane with with the control

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,120
plane and forwarding plane

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,400
would be in the 5g specifically moving

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,120
forward uh

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
we would we'd not only see a trend uh

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,360
that

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,360
you know forwarding plane would be much

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,720
more simplified on-prem

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,640
and rest of the functions could be

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,280
ported onto the cloud so

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,520
innovation point of view uh having a

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,120
very light weight system

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,280
on-prem and rest of the heavy processing

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,280
could be done in the cloud it's very

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,760
very important

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,559
from access technology point of view

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,600
having

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:56,720
agnostic to just the lte or cbrs

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,960
having wi-fi as well as other

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:01,679
systems being enabled in future

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,400
satellite perhaps leo satellites

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,679
enables us to do things faster because

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,720
some of the stadiums

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,799
will not just have private lte or cbrs

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,559
they will have wi-fi existing and we

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,600
can't we will have to work in a

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,200
retrofication

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,120
mode or we will have to work in a

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,679
brownfield scenario rather than

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,400
just rip and replace mode so this this

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,520
is is

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,120
very very innovative uh solution uh for

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
us it helps us from

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,880
through gallery point of view to

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,080
leverage the the commodity hardware

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,000
and it enables us to do those at speed

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,080
whereas if we engage with the with the

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,240
current uh set of vendors

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,840
um it's very difficult to get just one

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,159
feature done to kind of you know ask

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,200
them to open certain specific functions

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,960
uh exposure functions for example and

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,559
it's it's pretty pulling teeth out of

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,440
line's mouth and it's this is the

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,280
flexibility

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,720
and this is the power of open source and

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,720
this is the power of

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,240
open community and and to touch upon

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
linux foundation i mean there's no

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,400
company better in the world when it

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,720
comes to

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,080
delivering outcomes and tangible

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,720
outcomes using open source

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,240
and i had the the privilege and and

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
fortune to kind of work with linux

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,960
foundation and several other product

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,760
projects and me and my team are super

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
excited

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,919
uh that this a um to

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,960
to to see the community members who are

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,840
really committed

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,760
to drive this forward and b to have a

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,000
support from the company like linux

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,960
foundation who really know how to

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,240
take the the community uh outputs and

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,720
convert that into tangible outcomes

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,039
thank you i'm i'm actually fascinated by

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,640
the insight that you've made on costs

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,840
that it's not just

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,919
that magma is available as a free

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,200
open source software system that you can

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,080
use without

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,559
direct cost but the impact that magma's

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,159
design

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,559
principles have on on the cost of the

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,880
rest of the products that you run it on

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,760
the product or platform agnostic

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,960
approach

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,280
and the open interface to different

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,720
different radio vendors and radio

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,240
suppliers

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,280
has on that total cost of ownership so

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,919
thank you um i think i'll direct

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,039
my next question to uh jesse and

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,120
marielle

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,480
um as as operators and innovators

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,000
in serving underserved and unserved

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,400
communities what do you need from the

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,200
magma team or as we move into a

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,320
community

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,320
project what would be i think that the

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,280
biggest thing that you think we can

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,159
enable

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,640
uh through that community that is not in

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,679
play

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,640
today in magma itself for other

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,640
commercial products

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,960
you see my starting blocks well a lot of

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,400
it because of the open source nature is

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,600
actually being taken

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,559
care of so we work on a network of our

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,880
engineers we have

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,039
engineers that we hire but we also have

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,400
a huge volunteer corps that kind of

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,640
help us figure out what's happening in

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,320
the future and one of the things that we

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,200
needed actually was stability

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,480
and support and product and freedom buy

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,640
actually helped a lot with that

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,760
when it comes to the wii u's in

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,039
supporting our

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,760
tisps our tribal isps as they grow

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,600
a lot of them will stick with magma um

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,760
and they'll want to be able to transfer

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,640
over to a commercial system like freedom

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,960
fi

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,400
uh at the same time we have to support

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,000
um

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,880
you know we have clients that have i um

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,400
i t uh staff of a couple dozen and they

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,600
want to log on to github and they want

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,679
to see where this is going and they want

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,200
to see what it's about and see its guts

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,120
and because of its nature they feel like

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,440
they get to know the system more so

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,120
than the proprietary cores out there and

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
it's funny i'm here and i usually one of

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,799
the things that often happens

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,720
is that there's a huge sticker shock uh

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,960
when it when they realize how easy it is

00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,360
to run their own private lte network

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,240
um and the cost savings that they have

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,600
and the

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,520
flexibility they have in choosing your

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,600
equipment that they're not beholden to

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:09,200
cpes that necessarily cost seven hundred

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,720
dollars i know they can buy a hundred

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,320
dollar cpe and

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,400
know the risks um this is what's been

00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,440
huge the transparency

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,880
so as our clients grow they can

00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,000
see uh what um you know what where they

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,799
want to go and it helps them form their

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,039
vision

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,640
and the now commercial um pieces that

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:30,159
are surrounding it so that they can also

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,840
do the handoff where they want to do the

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,600
handoff if they just want to fund office

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,120
they can just run up on office

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,880
if they want to run a front office in

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,919
smart hands they can do that and if they

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,960
want to grow their own

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,640
internal capacity and

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,320
learn how to run the stuff on them for

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
themselves there's trainings that are

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,720
easy

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:48,400
to adapt to them and meet them where

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,600
they're at so that's what i'm loving

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,240
about magma

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,640
that's fabulous thanks jesse anything

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,120
you

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
you'd like to add or thoughts um i mean

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,240
kind of build off uh

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,760
i think merrell's key point is the

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,840
support um

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,840
obviously uh you know it's an open

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
source you're not gonna have

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,360
with the traditional vendor right that

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,840
level of different tiered

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,559
support um i think companies like

00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,679
freedom5

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,480
definitely fill in a lot of that gap and

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,960
void

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,080
so you know more i think partners like

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,039
that are helpful

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,520
my understanding is also teams also

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,240
looking to potentially have some

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,279
um some support like uh sessions

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,000
potentially

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,520
with a with a team so i think things

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,159
like that would definitely help

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,200
um the more you know more

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,279
commercialization

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,039
and more deployments of magma for sure

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,679
because that's always the

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,320
i think the the most skittish point uh

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,480
that

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,080
you know most i guess operators that

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,679
speak with you know whenever they have

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,279
with magmas you know what's the support

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,120
i'm gonna have if i have an outage who

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,919
do i reach and things like that

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,880
um but yeah that transparency is also

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,840
you know

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,279
a big bonus uh you know you know against

00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,760
underside they're going to be afraid you

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,919
know

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,880
coming from myself being on vendor side

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,440
you know you're usually

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,039
usually pretty careful on providing you

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,480
know what the actual road map is because

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,279
things can change and

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,679
you try not to you know share too much

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,320
for

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,760
for you know certain reasons um you know

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,120
obviously that's more of the open source

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,600
nature of magma but

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,400
um being able to see like very clearly

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
um

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,799
what the road map looks like um you know

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,080
what everyone's working on you can get

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,760
you know up to the

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,520
the day status and you know look at

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,559
github see what the commits are it's

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,320
it's you know that is uh very refreshing

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,320
i think for for a number of people um

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,240
but yeah the support is you know i think

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,840
that's really the key so it was us

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,919
you know if we have a decent support

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,240
there uh i think that

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,159
that would probably be the the last road

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,279
blocker i think that some might have

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,520
with magma feature wise uh

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,559
you know make my actually does have the

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,480
majority of

00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,720
at least much of the operators i'm

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,760
working with uh i already support so i

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,679
already need

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,520
um so that you know obviously roadmap's

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,279
looking good to add more

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,600
i think when it comes to

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,559
some of the more enterprise type

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,679
applications

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,360
they're looking for more of a true wi-fi

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,679
bridge

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,960
and you know to support something like

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,600
that you know

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,640
you kind of need like a another layer on

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,360
the top of everything

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,679
to truly bridge devices behind the user

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,440
or

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,640
the ue um so with that you know vxlan

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,960
gre protocols things of that nature are

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,000
kind of required my understanding was

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,840
work or

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,760
some testing is being done in that area

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,080
but if

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,120
those kind of protocols can be supported

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,279
to support

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,320
true bridging to the devices behind the

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,799
cpu ue um that's going to

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,919
open up all the enterprise cases for

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,880
sure

00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,080
thanks thanks very much we are quickly

00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,799
coming up on time

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,360
so uh i would like to solicit any

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,919
further comments uh either sasha or

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,919
or jim and then boris i think i have a

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,559
last question that i'm saving for you

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,399
so uh sasha jim anything i'm gonna

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,600
comment on the previous topic but i'll

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,640
then

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,120
maybe it's related

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,039
it's related i'll make a point in terms

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,679
of the two things that we're working on

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,640
now with

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,480
magma and involving sasha two he's

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,799
participating in is

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,919
is what's critical that we see what

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:33,919
magnus do and you

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,919
alluded to it earlier phil is in terms

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,520
of how do we just increase the capacity

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,240
how we serve the underserved and how do

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,520
we make the

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,600
existing uh uh efficient so the two

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:46,399
initiatives that we're working on

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,919
is one is a schema framework uh actually

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,600
session and open schema

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:50,960
and what that does is it let us

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,399
understand what's going on the network

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,600
because you don't know necessarily

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,799
how do you decide where to put your

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,159
assets out there if you don't know

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,799
essentially what the

00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,480
the challenges are so a a standardized

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,039
way to collect data from the ue

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,640
and also the uh access technologies uh

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,559
the devices themselves

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,760
um is critical component so anybody

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,120
wants to participate that there's a

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,120
magma channel on slack

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,720
it's called uh open schema so you can

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,480
participate in that activity

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,080
the other one that's equally excited is

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,799
once you know this information you have

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,200
that

00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:20,640
is how do we harvest all this capacity

00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,000
like i said unlicensed inspection the

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,039
majority of the time that you use your

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,039
mobile phone

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,360
uh wi-fi is around but not necessarily

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,960
use so there's a motivational aspect out

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,320
but there's also simplification how do

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,399
we make it simple

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,080
for these capacity providers you know

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,080
first wi-fi but eventually it's gonna be

00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,600
predominantly uh private lte

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,679
to join what we call an augmented

00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,120
network so we're working with uh the

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:44,159
magnet team with shaw

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,200
and jenny and and sasha and uh some

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,080
other partners to

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,720
develop a smart contract based uh on

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,120
augmented

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,320
augmented network roaming solution so

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,720
you know there's there's around

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,399
750 billion access points out there so

00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,320
how do we harness all that energy

00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,840
to reduce the cost for the operators so

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,919
they can expand in

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,600
serving other areas or providing new

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,760
services so those are the two

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,720
key initiatives that we're working on

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,760
with the magma

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,799
thanks thanks jim the the obligatory

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,679
subproject advertising

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,559
so and and and maybe maybe i can add

00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:19,120
something

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,679
um and this is what what really drives

00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,120
me

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,600
uh for for magma is um

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,679
there if you look at dt we have some

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,360
guiding principles at six i i

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,440
i don't give you all of them but one of

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,080
them is i'm getting things done

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,760
and normally in our telco industry it's

00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,000
like

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,600
if you want to do a project you have to

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,200
go and start an rfi

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,200
and then you start something else and

00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,000
then you go to trial and then you go to

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,320
something and

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,159
it it takes you years to get something

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,760
done and essentially if you

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,320
if you do something like that magma

00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,760
journey i i think yesterday evening i

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,600
looked something in the code because i

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,799
was interested in how something is

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,200
working and then i

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,399
and then i just got on github and looked

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,559
how it's working so

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,120
i think this is a kind of a different

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:08,399
world that we are approaching there and

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,440
that we operators um yeah need to get

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,000
better in and to get things

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,880
faster done and deliver more value to

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,640
our customers

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,799
so thank you thanks so so boris we're

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,880
we're actually at time but i'm going to

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:25,039
give you the last word around this

00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,799
thought which is one of the one of the

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,360
things we're doing with our open source

00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,679
project

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:30,960
is building community and building a

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,559
community

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,519
that is able to work in an open

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,000
way but one of the difficulties of that

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,640
in

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,399
in using those products commercially is

00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,960
the ability to support

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,600
uh those those activities and both

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,480
marielle

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,640
and jesse touched on the value that

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,919
having freedom fi

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,159
available to them got them in having

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,960
a support model for an open source

00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,799
project

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,080
tell me your thoughts in just how

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,240
valuable that

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,200
that independent support model that

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,320
you're building

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,240
is in building that dynamic community

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,880
that lets magma as a whole be more

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,880
successful

00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,480
sure so i mean

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,039
there is this is not something that you

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,080
know

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,200
we have invented there is pretty much

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,799
everybody

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,960
today has touched on the many

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,279
pluses of leveraging an open source

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,640
project starting with the

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:39,600
you know cost efficiency of it

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,600
however the

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,360
cost efficiency and the many pluses only

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,640
come out

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,840
if um you know there is a

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:52,880
a way to kind of a

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,880
package and consistently kind of

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,200
commercialize and support the project

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,240
so i guess let me just try to rephrase

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,880
it if

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,519
any one of the organizations presenting

00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,600
here

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,760
wanted to go and use magma

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,840
and there were nobody in the ecosystem

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,120
that could provide a kind of a supported

00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:13,039
commercial version of it

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,039
it would actually be quite expensive

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,200
simply because of the learning curve

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,039
simply because of you know understanding

00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,360
which is the stable version

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,320
what bugs to fix and things like that so

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,600
because of that

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,840
historically the way that uh you know

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,760
open source projects across the board

00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,559
have become successful is that

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,000
there are a number of entities um such

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,840
as freedom fight

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,080
that actually you know build a

00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:41,120
commercial

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,919
tested distribution of it so this way on

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,559
one hand

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:46,399
you kind of uh you know leverage the

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:48,960
community contribution to the

00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,600
r d and development and the open roadmap

00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,720
side of it

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,760
but at the same time it's pre-packaged

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,159
in such a way

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,760
that um you know it's fairly

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,279
straightforward to use

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,679
for um you know anybody who's trying to

00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,799
uh

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,480
take advantage of it so and this is

00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,200
specifically a kind of you know

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,960
the journey that we're on at freedom

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,079
fight today

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,839
and i would say that you know

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,639
we're probably not um you know like

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,399
a hundred percent where we need to be

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,679
like if i was to put myself

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,599
into the shoes of an end user um

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,960
i think if you were to take magma even

00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,480
the one that you know

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,480
we shipped to the end user um the

00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,399
user experience can be improved

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,119
dramatically like what you get from us

00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,800
is probably

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,879
quite a bit better than what you get if

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,040
you just pulled it from an open source

00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,839
repo and try to figure your way out

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,040
yourself but we still have a long way to

00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,159
go from

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:53,520
like a you know like a true

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,200
consumer type of experience but uh

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,280
i think one of the probably most

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,240
important things that that need to

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,359
happen

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,200
down the line is um this this this type

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,839
of work like the packaging

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,440
needs to be really kind of you know

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,320
consumer friendly

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,000
the first kind of talk of magma growth

00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,920
was about

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,920
making it like getting it to the

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,440
necessary level of minimum feature

00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,680
function for it to be

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,520
useful and then for this feature

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,240
function to be stable

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,720
and now i think that we're kind of there

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,480
but

00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,480
it's still largely kind of like an

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,240
enterprise product that is not very

00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,920
straightforward to deploy unless you're

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,359
like an experienced telco

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,560
the next big leap for us um at freedom

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,720
fight and i think should be

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,240
you know for everybody um in the

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,880
ecosystem at large

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,079
is to really make it uh more kind of you

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,000
know end user friendly

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,440
and you know consumer deployable and

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,280
kind of more of like a push button

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,720
experience

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,640
thanks well that we're at time we're

00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,200
actually a little bit over our time

00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,720
so i want to thank our panelists for

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,599
coming and sharing

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,480
this diverse view of how a product like

00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,760
magma can

00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:08,800
impact communities can support

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,079
the growth of business and can enable

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,880
new and novel technology uses within the

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,320
telecom

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,440
community thank you all thank you phil

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,440
