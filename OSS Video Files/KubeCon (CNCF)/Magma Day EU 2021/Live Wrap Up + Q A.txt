	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,280
so this is phil and i want to thank

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,120
everyone

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,559
for coming and joining us today for

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,960
the magma day event we had a fabulous

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,000
day

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,200
throughout with presentations covering a

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,039
range from

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,840
magma's construction how it's being used

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,920
in various

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,039
applications how it's it's impacting

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,279
the wireless business and

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:34,480
being a foundation for a much broader

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,800
uh impact or collection

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:42,879
of projects that lf is putting together

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,480
uh to support wireless applications and

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,680
the democratization

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:51,760
of wireless worldwide so

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,520
i wanted to give our speakers

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,280
our key speakers a bit of a last word

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,879
there's also a q a chat available

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:06,159
if anyone wants to come and join us for

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,560
a closing q a so

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,200
uh with that i'll let arpit

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,840
open things up arpa anything that you

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,320
want to

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,960
close the day with or thoughts that you

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,520
may have

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:21,040
about the magma project and what we've

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,200
shared today

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,080
no i think hopefully people who stayed

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,400
on really got some very deep insights

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,119
not just from the developers but also

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,400
from

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:34,799
the users and you know while we have

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,119
not explained all of the bits and bytes

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,840
on how projects come together

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,200
you know we have the experts if there's

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,399
questions you can ask

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:47,840
uh on the live session uh for sure

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,200
um obviously you know information is on

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,720
on the website there is lots of projects

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,399
putting everything together

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,759
the community is vibrant let's put it

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
this way and

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,759
and 5g is here and you know we're

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,159
building on 4g but it's a

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,000
for a whole different ecosystem i know

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,439
the cloud native community

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,640
right typically view you know

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,080
this ecosystem has you know it's just a

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,959
connection what's the problem right

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,239
but there's a lot more uh than just a

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,120
simple workload

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
uh whether it's a search or you know

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,440
it's it's a social

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,560
media search uh connection right it's a

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,560
very complex

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,959
but our goal is to open it simplify it

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,800
automate it and and i think that's why

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,239
you're seeing the traction specifically

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,720
with industries like 5g

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,720
coming on so you know very excited to

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
have all of you join and be part of this

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,040
community

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,239
amar and shah yeah yeah

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,440
our all out i think the magna community

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,519
is super excited about joining

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,599
lf and working together with you

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,720
and the other lf networking and lf edge

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:06,080
projects that we can together take

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,879
into a very comprehensive view

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,519
of how to deploy networks in an open

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,040
source

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,440
manner amar anything you'd like to add

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,000
on our day today

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,959
thanks a lot for the opportunity uh to

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,080
talk here and

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,400
also present some of our ideas the

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,959
things that we want to highlight is that

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,159
while cups has been fairly well

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,080
understood

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,680
we'd like to think of magma as an

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
evolution on cups

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080
so as part of that you know we're also

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,000
going to be publishing a series of blogs

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,200
as well as you know i think with the

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,280
help of the lf

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,760
edx platform we're also putting together

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,239
a high-level introduction to magma that

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,640
gives

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,159
an overview of a lot of these concepts

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,720
so all of that is going to be

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,360
coming soon so please stay plugged in

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080
with the

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
community and you know we'll hopefully

00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,319
clarify a lot of these concepts

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:03,840
hey hey phil i i just got reminded that

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,200
the session is starting at 5 55 so we

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,400
might be a couple of minutes

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,400
early we may want to restart

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,319
sorry about that no no no no problem i

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,639
yeah it just gives people time to just

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,840
like come between sessions and and get

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,919
back so

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
uh because i was wondering you know

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,880
where's the q and all and now you know

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
you can see that

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,080
people are joined so okay what do you

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,240
have to do like

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,160
do we have to get out and get in no no

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,400
we we're fine i think

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,080
we're good uh it's just the timing we

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,800
started a little bit early so

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
let's let's restart the whole thing

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,720
sorry

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,440
phil so for everyone who watched us

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,800
rehearse

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:51,199
our closing session here apologies

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:54,479
i'm phil and i'm the magma community

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,320
manager or community evangelist and i

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:59,360
wanted to thank

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
everyone who took the time to join us

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,680
today

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,560
as we shared about uh what's happening

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,280
with the magma project and we were able

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,639
to share

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,919
a very broad range of views

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,199
about magma starting with a developer's

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,919
insight

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,560
from amar and some directions we're

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,759
going

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,639
with brian a number of i think very

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,840
interesting

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,960
user views and lightning talks and

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,720
an insightful thought on how magma fits

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,840
into a larger ecosystem of projects

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,800
being put together by lf to

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,680
to develop a much more comprehensive

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,080
view

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,160
of how you can bring open source

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,960
software and systems

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
to support wireless networks going

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,720
forward and provide

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,440
the foundation for an open source 5d

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,919
echo system i wanted to take a minute

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,440
and remind everyone here that we do

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,880
have a q a uh chat up and if anyone

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,759
wants to put questions

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,680
for our closing speakers there we'd love

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,919
to address them for you

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,199
and while we wait for that i'll let each

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,080
of our speakers take

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,000
a turn uh to summarize their thoughts

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,319
and give any closing comments for the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,240
day

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,479
and we can uh start with arpit thank you

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
so i think uh first of all we're very

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,479
excited that you

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,400
took the time to look at the uh the

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,680
magma project in general

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,160
uh i think the the interesting thing is

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,840
uh if you look at network telecom in

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,639
general from an end-to-end perspective

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,919
you have the core

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,960
you have the edge and you have the

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,240
access and a lot of the core in terms of

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,039
the infrastructure has

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440
already opened up uh through projects

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,240
under

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,880
lf networking uh specifically as 5g

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,440
requires

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,960
network automation uh edge is opening up

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,599
in terms of open source

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,960
open ran is there now to enable the ram

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,440
and disaggregation

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,280
so one of the big missing pieces with

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,240
the mobile core or the backend core as

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,520
we call it

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,360
and uh while the cloud community is

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,160
quite uh you know eager to help on this

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,520
it does bring in a lot of complexities

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,120
historically because of

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,280
brownfield deployments and things like

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,919
that so our goal with magma

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
and with magma as part of the overall

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:23,599
integrated

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,039
solutions as part of lf projects is to

00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,680
make it simple

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,120
make it open make it automated and you

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,759
know please help us

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
get there and if you want to participate

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
it's

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,319
magma's website i think we've mentioned

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,440
it in several of the chats

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,000
as well as uh pulling magma into an

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
end-to-end

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,960
ecosystem through what is called uh 5g

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,960
super blueprints

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
which is a which is an initiative under

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,080
lf networking so you can join there as

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
well and participate

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,440
but that's kind of where bulk of the

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,199
ecosystem

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,879
players are are pulling it all together

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,840
and we're really excited and

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,879
uh you know of this vibrant community

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,440
thanks harpit

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,560
amar any closing thoughts and again one

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,240
more reminder the q

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,960
a chat is open if anyone wants to

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,800
bring a question to to our conference

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,919
hosts

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,440
amar awesome uh thanks everybody and

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,160
thank you for the opportunity to

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,919
uh you know present at uh magma day so a

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
couple of things i just wanted to wrap

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,599
up on this

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,000
uh so the first one is that you know uh

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,080
cups

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
is a fairly well understood architecture

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,000
and so what we're trying to do

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,880
with magma is a bit of an evolution on

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
cups

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,719
uh it's almost like taking a lot of the

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,240
principles that have proven out in the

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,919
data center with like hierarchical

00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,039
control planes and you know marrying it

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,200
into a

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,519
sort of a cups framework and that is a

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,040
fairly fundamental evolution in terms of

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,560
how the architecture is going to look

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,320
like going forward

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,360
so uh while this is a new concept

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,560
we hope to you know put out a few blogs

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,040
as well as you know

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,480
uh also there's a introduction to magma

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
course that is gonna

00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,360
be available uh sometime in june through

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,440
the linux foundation edx platform

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,800
that clarifies a lot of these concepts

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,200
and so

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,200
please stay tuned and continue to follow

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,240
us on magmacore.org

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,880
uh we'll have a lot more you know

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,040
articles around this new architectural

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,399
evolution that we're trying to propose

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,839
and lastly uh the plug for the 5g

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,240
site uh so 5g is in active development

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,120
uh in fact we've just sort of aligned on

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
scope for

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
a lot of the slicing functionality that

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,240
we're going to introduce into the magna

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,560
5g

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,160
uh code base so this is a great place

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,880
for folks to contribute

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,880
as well as you know a great way to stay

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
engaged with the community

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,279
as shah mentioned in the new enterprise

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,160
sort of use cases that are also coming

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,720
up

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
so thanks again uh and hope to see you

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,480
on

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,560
slack and magmacore thanks amar

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,320
uh brian any closing thoughts you want

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,279
to share with us

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,000
uh just a couple uh i'll note that um we

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,600
think

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,920
in addition to what amara mentioned one

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,440
of magma's neat differentiations is its

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,760
ability to run at the

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,720
access edge for telcos or all the way at

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
the user edge

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,399
in the case of decentralized wireless

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,279
networks we think both of those are

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,200
pretty

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,320
innovative and differentiating versus

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,240
alternatives

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,839
we'd like to invite everyone to please

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
join the community and help build your

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,399
projects on magma

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,480
if you're looking to resell magma as

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,800
part of a broader solution

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
the project's uh designed for that and

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,240
we'd love to welcome you

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,279
to do so if you're an academic

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
researcher uh

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,880
there's a lot of uh emerging standards

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,440
and supports for

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,519
for new use cases coming in 5g we see

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,200
those showing up first in open source

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
so it's a it's another great way to get

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
involved and so

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,399
like omar mentioned we look forward to

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,680
seeing you on slack and in the community

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,760
thanks thank thanks brian we we really

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,800
would love to have people come join us

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,440
on this journey

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,440
with magma and shaw the last word

00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,200
[Music]

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,959
thank you phil yeah yeah it's uh

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,839
been exciting and thank you for the

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,920
opportunity just like all of you are uh

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,200
uh saying i really don't have much to

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,200
add uh

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,120
on top of that feels great job in

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,640
moderating throughout the day

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,120
um great presenters my heartfelt thanks

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,480
to

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:36,800
all the magma uh participants today

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,200
um arbit um always i i watch your talks

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,800
what connects the end-to-end uh

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,839
challenge every time i think about you i

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,160
think about

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,920
like how it's not just about the core or

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,680
not just about the edge you talk about

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,440
end to end which is very very

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:54,320
uh you know refreshing and amar

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,480
definitely the the the cups evolution i

00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,240
sometimes call that cops2.0

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,680
which is uh we hope that it what the

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,800
future of the cellular networks are

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
going to look like and not just a

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,079
cellular

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,200
as the cellular technologies get more

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,120
and more into the

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,480
enterprise side supporting consumer

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,480
networks and so on

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,760
i think it's just gonna evolve in that

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,920
direction

00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,959
and uh brian obviously the edge is a

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,880
clear part of that

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,079
so thank you for all the great call-outs

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,519
and

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,000
last but not the least those who

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,000
attended the sessions today

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,720
i hope that you found the sessions worth

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,040
your time and you have some takeaways

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,959
from these sessions right and it's a

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,760
developer community so there is no point

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,519
in uh

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,959
making a marketing or a product pitch

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,600
here i think what's

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,720
would be the best just echoing everybody

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
is that

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,880
come and join us uh and you know github

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,440
or slack

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,560
join us watch it from the sideline and

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,399
when you see there's something

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,639
interesting and exciting for you

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,200
participate and start contributing

00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,959
there's a lot of excitement uh i mean

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,959
exciting things that are happening

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,440
as amar pointed out there's some slicing

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,720
stuff the 5g perspective

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,639
there are all these different network

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:10,000
models that are coming up um

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:12,560
yeah that's my biggest say that you know

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,160
don't uh yeah hopefully you're just not

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,680
gonna just watch it from the industry

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,680
from outside you're gonna come in and

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,920
join us and contribute

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,600
there's a lot of interesting things that

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,279
you can you can

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,279
hopefully uh take away and hopefully

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,800
there are impacts you can make at the

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,440
industry level

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,839
that's all i appreciate once again the

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,959
time

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,839
taken to to to watch these sessions

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
that's okay so shaw just as you started

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,440
talking i

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,760
a question came in from her crash which

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,000
is do you see the possibility of trump

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,279
trying the 5g edge deployments with

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
blueprints

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,639
to get some sizing numbers for the

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,279
hardware and

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:55,120
software and i know i promised you the

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,279
last word but i think i'll toss that

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,560
question back to amarr

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,680
or brian to see how we might respond to

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,040
that

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,040
please do thank you

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,560
amar sure um yeah so i

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,600
the the as our path already commented

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,800
yeah so

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,079
a lot of the end-to-end blueprint uh is

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,399
about dimensioning and

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,839
integration interfaces and so what we

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,120
are actually working with

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,880
uh you know the lfh team as well as the

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,000
actual blueprint is precisely around

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,399
that

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,399
in parallel there are other uh community

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,040
members like canonical who are also

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,160
trying to

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,639
offer uh magma on their infrastructure

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,480
and so that is a parallel dimensioning

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,560
exercise that we're also undertaking

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,120
between with both canonical and and aws

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,959
so uh the key takeaway here is that

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
everyone has a slightly different like

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,360
forwarding plane

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,959
and so you know a lot of this

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,399
dimensioning has to happen within the

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,240
context of the solution that

00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,240
magma is running on so well the

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
nuts and bolts look similar the actual

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,240
like uh sizing would be a little

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,440
different

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,480
thanks amar and with that uh i want to

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
offer a

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,399
heartfelt thank you to everyone who came

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,480
and shared their morning

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,240
or afternoon with us depending on where

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,639
you're at in the world

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,720
and thank you to our speakers and the

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,760
hosts that you have here

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,959
and hope everyone has a fabulous

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:28,240
remainder of your day and enjoy the rest

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,360
of the

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,440
kubecon cncf event the remainder of this

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,560
week thanks everybody bye-bye

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,560
