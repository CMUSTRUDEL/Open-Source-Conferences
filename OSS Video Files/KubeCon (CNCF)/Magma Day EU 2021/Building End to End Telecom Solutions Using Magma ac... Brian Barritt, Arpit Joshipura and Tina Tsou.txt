hi everyone my name is brian barrett and

00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,799
i'm a software engineering manager at

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,160
facebook

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,000
i support the team at facebook

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
connectivity that contributes to the

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,160
magma project

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,160
in the magma core foundation

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,200
so we've just heard an excellent

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,080
overview from amarr who talked about

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,880
magma

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,320
why it's different how it's architected

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,920
what it's used for and how it's designed

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,960
to dramatically reduce

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,640
the total cost of ownership of networks

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,119
we at facebook connectivity see this

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,279
important to bringing more people online

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,640
and also to enabling the open source

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,719
telco movement

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
and catalyzing open source 5g

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
magma is a hyper scalable and

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,120
distributed core one of the things

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,000
that's different about magma is it's

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,399
designed to run at the

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,399
far edge on far edge appliances to

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,879
support local breakout to ip

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,559
all the way at the sell site it's open

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,879
source and license free

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,239
it's cloud native containerized and

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,520
features control plane user plane

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,280
separation

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,719
it's modern vendor and transport

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,960
agnostic

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,799
and supports integration with existing

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,640
mobile network operator cores

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,200
using the optional federation gateway

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,960
shown on the diagram as amar explained

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,799
and it supports all access conversions

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,119
so it's designed for lte

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
for wi-fi for private lte use cases with

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,000
cvrs spectrum

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,000
and also 5g use cases

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,680
but i'd like to talk a bit first about

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,479
magma's history

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,080
how it started where it's gone and how

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,799
it's really accelerating lately

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,000
as it's really found accelerated growth

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
in the community

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
so if you look two years ago when magma

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,640
first showed up on github

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,600
it was being built by a small group of

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,720
software engineers at facebook

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,840
around 20 or 30 people built magma the

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,479
team grew

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,320
until in july of 2020 magma was

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,920
announced as an open source project with

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,520
the release 1.0

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,280
backed and supported by the open

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,840
infrastructure foundation

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,119
the telecom infra project as one of

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,880
possibly several

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
open core networks and the open air

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,040
interface software alliance

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,240
and since july 2020 the community has

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,680
grown rapidly

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,920
so across these three sets here of

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,119
advocates contributors and participants

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,879
these are the sets of

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,520
people that participate in writing code

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,280
for magma as advocates

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,480
people that participate in code reviews

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,440
and technical discussions as

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,599
contributors

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,879
and people who engage in the community

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,160
on slack and q

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,840
a and participate in github discussions

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,840
and it's really grown dramatically and

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
in february 2021

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,519
we announced our next move for the

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,080
community which is to become

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,280
a neutral foundation called the magma

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,040
core foundation

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,480
hosted under the linux foundation with

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
neutral governance

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,160
and that occurred in february 2021 which

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,959
we announced at our magma developers

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,720
conference

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,760
and we've noticed even more rapid growth

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,160
since then so as of april 2021

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,760
we had over 400 people actively engaging

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,879
and contributing in the design and

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,879
engineering of magma

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,920
the community is actually even larger

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,840
than that if you look at the last tier

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
in the orbit model of people who are

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,720
observers of the project that are

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,159
starring our repo

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,480
or uh pulling um a branch on

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,879
on github it's actually even larger so

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,040
we have we clock in over 1500

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,720
members of the community at this point

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,840
that are either members of our slack

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,599
community or starring our repo and are

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,599
pulling a branch on git

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,280
so when the magma core foundation was

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,920
founded in 2021

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,400
we're really trying to position magma as

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,680
the de facto open source network core

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
and we think we're there with the launch

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,959
of the magma core foundation

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,400
so you'll find familiar governance from

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,599
the linux foundation with a technical

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,280
steering committee

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,760
and a governing board the technical

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,400
steering committee is comprised of uh

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,640
is elected group of contributors and the

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,239
governing board is comprised of members

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,920
that join to help steer the project's

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,680
strategy so we retain our affiliation

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,799
with the telecom info project as one of

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,040
possibly several

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,720
open core networks facebook community

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,920
still provides a backstop of software

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,560
engineering contribution to the

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,480
community

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,480
we also provide a backstop of technical

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,920
support to systems integrators and

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,319
value-added resellers that want to

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,159
deploy

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,760
magma who can be assured of that it can

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,519
receive level 4 support from the

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
facebook software engineering team

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,359
for any operational issues that could

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
emerge

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,720
we have ecosystem partners at the open

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,040
infrastructure foundation

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
and open air interface software alliance

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
and a number of both

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
large existing well-known companies and

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,520
new startups that are participating

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,520
in the magma core foundation

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,479
so it's our belief that magma will be

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,600
the one open core implementation

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,600
that's open source that's converged

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,120
and that supports multiple types of

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
access technologies and is access

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
agnostic

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,639
that's cloud native across both the

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,400
central cloud and the edge cloud

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
and is multi-tenant allowing a single

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,040
instance to manage potentially multiple

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,040
networks at a time

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,560
so here's how we're building the

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,639
ecosystem if you look across we have

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,800
industry groups that we partner with to

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,960
help scale our developer community

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,000
and help drive adoption amongst

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,280
developers

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,320
and operators developers and operators

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,280
help define current use cases but also

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
motivate future

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,360
use cases and we partner with research

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,199
projects as magma

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,639
with the academic community to help

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,320
investigate some of those super

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
future use cases so examples are there

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,520
are features that are showing up in 5g

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,120
releases 16 and 17

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,280
like integrated access and backhaul

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,320
networks uh like non-terrestrial

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,000
connectivity and 5g release 17

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,440
also work in onf and open

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,560
air interface software alliance and oran

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,960
alliance

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,160
on uh software-defined radio access

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,199
network and radio intelligence

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,479
controller work

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
because we've seen people building on

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,080
top of magma to integrate through

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,080
with non-real-time radio intelligence

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,240
controllers

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,360
the academic community really helps spur

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,000
innovation

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,720
that we see flowing into startups that

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
want to use

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,639
magma to build novel solutions that they

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,039
build on top of

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,360
and then startups help drive adoption in

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,800
industry groups so startups often

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,360
will partner and use magma technology

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,039
to build end-to-end solutions uh new

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,800
innovative solutions and take things to

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,120
market as value-added resellers of the

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,120
stack

00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,280
we really like to invite anyone

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,800
listening to consider joining

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,199
and building your connectivity software

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,560
as a surface or enterprise solution or

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
end consumer solution

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,759
on top of magma to build your business

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,120
faster and ride the 5g wave with us

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
so here's what's in it for you if you're

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,800
if you're looking uh at yourself as a

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,000
as a possible uh distro vendor of magma

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,240
you're going to build your own distro

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
around it and take it to market so your

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
development teams

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,680
can focus on development and integration

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
as a key part of your strategy

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,360
you can use magma's production grade

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
commercial ready building blocks to

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,280
build your end-to-end solutions

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:04,960
and lean on the magma community to help

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,960
you know kind of jump start your project

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,080
if you're a startup or an investor we

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,759
think the magma stack's pretty

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,120
compelling because it lets you

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,560
build your solution faster and

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,759
accelerate your product development your

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:15,199
total time to market

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,280
if you have an expert community you can

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
lean on and you can explore adjacent

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,479
opportunities

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,919
in emerging use cases around the core

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,199
problem you're trying to solve

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,039
so it really it's just going to help you

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,280
accelerate as a project so you can

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,759
see here some of the quotes from from

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,080
boris the founder and ceo of freedomfi

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,360
and also patrick the founder and ceo of

00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,680
connect 5g

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
who know how magma helped them in their

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,000
project

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,039
go to market faster deploy faster and

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,840
and really act as

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,440
an engine powering wireless innovation

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,440
so i noted magna is partnering with

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,039
academic and public domain projects

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,720
so if you think about some bleeding edge

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,680
research projects that uh

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,240
you know are trying to do

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,440
experimentation on some of the latest

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,360
things in 3gpp or other projects

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,639
it's not very practical to start from

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,520
scratch uh

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,199
recreating parts of a 4g or 5g stack

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,039
only to add your new use case

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,240
or differentiation or research project

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,319
on top of it

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,520
and it's difficult to do that with any

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,360
existing commercial

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,720
solutions because you don't have access

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,919
to the source code so what we're

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,520
witnessing is that

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,840
a lot of the bleeding edge features are

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,240
showing up first in open source

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,039
so an example there is a non-terrestrial

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,680
connectivity

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,759
with the satisfy project or the esa alex

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,520
project by the european space agency

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,880
to adapt cellular protocols and

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,560
waveforms to be used

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,320
for non-terrestrial high altitude

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,919
platforms and satellite connectivity

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,599
projects

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,200
we already see contributions from those

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,640
projects with significant amounts of

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,640
public sector funding

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,880
showing up in open air interface and

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,560
open core projects

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,640
another example is public sector

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,560
opportunities with darpa

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,000
and the u.s department of defense

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,959
there's a lot of interest in that

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
community on shifting security left and

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,240
having

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,040
more secure open source solutions

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,640
deployed

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,399
because you have actually access to all

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,000
of the lines of code and when there is a

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,760
security vulnerability you can very

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
quickly patch it

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,399
rapidly and spin a new build and so that

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,640
that that helps mitigate supply chain

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,760
threats that uh can be of concern using

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,200
vendor equipment

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
and so there's projects going on with

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,680
darpa and the open programmable and

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,519
secure 5g

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,240
opportunity where they're looking at the

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,240
ad the advantageous nature of magma

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,920
and other open rand projects for their

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,600
ability to support that shift left

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,399
security model and quickly have a more

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,000
secure

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,920
uh solution that has a quicker

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,680
turnaround time on vulnerabilities

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,000
so we support several universities as

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,640
well shown here

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,440
who are using magma and are contributing

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
back to the community

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,760
so just to highlight a couple of really

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,440
interesting building blocks

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,600
and solutions that we see happening in

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,959
the community that were featured in our

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,880
magma developers conference that i

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,360
thought were particularly exciting

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,920
so we featured in in february of this

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
year

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,519
that we now have support for amazon's

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,120
far edge appliances

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,959
to deploy the magma access gateway

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,760
component so now if you're deploying

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,800
magma

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,320
on aws you can take advantage of work

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,440
that we've done together with with

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,000
amazon

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,079
to let you in a single click provision

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,079
your magma orchestrator in the cloud

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,600
but then deploy your magma access

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,480
gateway component

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,560
with no upfront cost on one of amazon's

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
far edge appliances that have electronic

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,839
ink shipping labels right on them

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,000
you just tell amazon where you want them

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,240
shipped and one of these

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,399
boxes ships out pre-provisioned with the

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,920
ami for the magma access gateway

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,519
and set up for zero touch provisioning

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
where it'll connect back to your to your

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,120
aws

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:45,760
hosted orchestrator in an aws region

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,320
or on-prem on outpost and set up your

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,680
network

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,720
for you and you're ready to go you just

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,240
connect your 5g 4g or 5g radio to it

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
which i think is pretty exciting so

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,880
these are ruggedized boxes

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,320
that are low cost you pay amazon you

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,480
know a monthly

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,920
subscription fee to use them and amazon

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
replaces them if they ever go bad

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,440
another really exciting uh solution that

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:12,720
we've seen built on top of magma

00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,000
is from the helium project so helium

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,640
is a is a cryptocurrency uh that

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,480
you know instead of uh you know burning

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,160
electricity to mine their coins

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,560
you actually mine coins by connecting

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,000
the unconnected and until now the helium

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,959
network's mostly been a

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,320
a lorowam network for iot where you

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,600
deploy

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,720
helium hotspots to extend a community

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,560
lorawan network

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,839
that anyone can use for their iot

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,560
applications

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,480
but freedom fi together with helium just

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:46,320
announced at our developers conference

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,519
a new solution where using cbrs spectrum

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,600
you can deploy 4g and 5g hotspots

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,440
to connect the unconnected in a people's

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,920
network using citizen broadband

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,279
spectrum that's unlicensed and free for

00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,720
anyone to use

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,279
for 4g and 5g and use that to mine coins

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,560
which is really exciting use case that i

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,000
think is really going to

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,079
we're going to see a lot of fast growth

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:11,760
and adoption from

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,680
so thanks for listening i think uh now

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,440
it's best to turn this over to arpit

00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,040
who is going to take you through some

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,200
end-to-end solutions

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,360
uh built on magma and their use cases

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,320
thank you brian that was a great

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
overview

00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,800
and a great set of use cases that kind

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,959
of cover the uh

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,160
magma ecosystem from a big picture

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,160
perspective

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,360
uh i'm excited to be here on the magma

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,920
day and uh

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,040
what i'm gonna do is basically give you

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,560
a quick overview

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,399
on how magma fits into the end-to-end

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,519
solutions across

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:50,160
multiple open source projects and

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,240
and how end-to-end use cases are being

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,440
developed by the community at the linux

00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,200
foundation

00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,720
uh joining me is uh tina sue from

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,839
arm who is the tsc chair for crano

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,120
a critical project under lfh so before i

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,519
get into the details

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,160
of the road map as well as the

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,279
end-to-end

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,639
uh solutions and and tina will walk

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,880
through the one specific example of

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,880
how a crano and magma are integrated

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,920
into what's called a blueprint

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,800
let's take a step back and look at the

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,720
big picture of

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,160
how vertical market adoption is

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,200
happening off and then into an open

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,160
source software

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
so you can see that there are lots of

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,079
open source projects

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,839
some of these are you know very critical

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,440
very important

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,040
it's not a comprehensive list by any

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,079
means

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,880
but as these projects come together

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,760
whether through apis to integrations

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
through

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,600
onboarding life cycle management through

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,040
use cases through demos

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,880
you know many different ways one of the

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,639
fundamental things that we have been

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,639
doing here at the linux foundation is

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:03,760
trying to get them

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,880
to evolve these markets so

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,800
in the middle uh you kind of see a big

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,320
segmentation you know there's the

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
enterprise networking

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,160
users and then there's the service

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:17,360
providers service providers obviously

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,639
include cloud service providers

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:23,279
uh telecom carriers etc

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,199
and then in the enterprise you have the

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,279
different verticals that each have a

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,240
different need from an iot and an edge

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,040
perspective

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,040
that will use magma as well as other

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,880
projects slightly differently

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,959
so if you look at the specific use cases

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,560
on that are very important

00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:43,120
in 2021 and maybe a couple of years

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,000
since then specifically for enterprise

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,600
networking you can

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,680
see we have private lte uh

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,360
how workloads run across clouds how do

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,279
you get network visibility

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,040
uh for an enterprise in these

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,040
multi-cloud deployments

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,240
uh but then when it comes to service

00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,480
providers

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,440
the telecom and cloud service providers

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,440
are

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,279
collaborating significantly under the

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,480
linux foundation networking under the

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,839
linux foundation edge

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,800
under cncf to bring you know an

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,440
end-to-end

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,560
5g based deployment to train people on

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,279
5g to

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,800
develop global connectivity huge

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,839
initiatives going on

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,160
and and and then as you get into

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,279
some of the very important users that

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,120
are

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,880
taking advantage of this open source

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,680
stack you know government

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,000
across the globe is at the forefront of

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,480
uh

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,680
building on these uh end-to-end open

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,160
source projects

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,000
uh one specific project i want to pro or

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,079
initiative i want to point out is is the

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,399
5g blueprints or

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,160
super blueprints as we call it uh under

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,639
the linux foundation networking

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,360
so this is what's happening and when you

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,880
take a

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,440
project centric view you can see

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,040
that from an end-to-end perspective uh

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,880
you know i've presented this at

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,480
multiple conferences but it keeps

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
getting better and better and

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,480
and as more innovation comes in uh from

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,680
the left

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
the various means of access uh mobile

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,040
networks residential

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,880
small medium or enterprise whether they

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,600
have their own data centers or not

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,440
uh you come in through oram um a project

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,279
under lfh called home edge

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
fledge eve all these projects i'll tell

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,560
you the use cases on that

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,959
brought into an edge integration project

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
called

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:29,279
crano and then move into the core part

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,560
of the

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:35,759
stack through a public cloud or

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,000
or through a telecom service provider

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,680
moving into the data plane acceleration

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,399
and the infrastructure part whether it's

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,600
fdio kubernetes dpdk etc

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,560
uh moving up into uh sort of the vims

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,759
which is open stack control plane uh

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,920
network automation

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,880
project for loan app all the way up into

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,040
the core

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,959
uh or network application functions

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,839
right now these could be vnf

00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,399
cnfs uh and one of the first ones that

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,120
now

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,480
uh we're showing you and talking about

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,679
today is magma

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,720
which is which is one of the first open

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,760
uh open mobile packet core which is kind

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,160
of a

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,120
an application sitting on the telco side

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,600
that can be

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,559
pulled into the end to end stack so very

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,400
important

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,000
uh uh you very important set of projects

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,400
that can be brought together

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,400
and then when you can do open compliance

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,799
and interoperability in

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,520
uh in an open environment under neutral

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,559
governance

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,880
that project you know like an anuket is

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,840
getting extreme traction this will just

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,080
speed up the deployment

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,520
so let's talk through how these projects

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,559
come together from an open source

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,520
perspective

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:49,039
uh as we all know uh projects are hosted

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,720
under neutral governance with the

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,679
developer community tsc

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,799
code gets produced uh documentation gets

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,760
produced a set of

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,200
uh use cases whatever right i mean it's

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,480
it's a set of technology that gets

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
produced

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,360
created across the world

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,120
brought together by either products

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,720
and integration integrators so these

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,840
could be vendors system integrators

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
bringing it all

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,320
and then put into production where

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,440
people can make money and then

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,559
invest back in the community so that's

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,440
kind of the

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,320
the circle of uh project life if you may

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,320
and

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,440
one of the things that we have seen in

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,559
the last three years

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,000
is the need for accelerating what is the

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,080
lower part of the cycle

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,320
products to production and for that

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,200
a couple of things need to happen the

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,600
interop

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,600
the compliance the verification the

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,679
testing the certification et cetera et

00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,760
cetera needs to happen in the open

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,240
open world it's not open source software

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,360
but it is open source governance

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,760
and two initiatives that i want to point

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,760
out

00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,960
one is lf networking's a project that

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:03,840
kind of combined two existing projects

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,520
uh opnfv and cntt i mean i'm throwing a

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,480
lot of acronyms here but

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,919
essentially they they are responsible

00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,799
for

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,760
defining architectures reference

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,120
architectures

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,039
whether it's openstack based or

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,080
kubernetes based into

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:23,760
a reference implementation that

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,960
a solution can get tested against

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,080
whether it's an fbi

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,120
man or vnfs and get certification and

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,440
batching for that so

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,120
very very interesting activities there

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,039
and then lfedge

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,559
is a set of blueprints that bring

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,640
hardware and software

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,080
as an implementation of a particular use

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,840
case uh

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,760
to the community so that it can be

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,280
reproduced and deployed very quickly and

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,400
we'll talk about some of these

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,000
in in a little bit more detail

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,039
so if i look at the specific use cases

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,840
that have uh that have come around

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,679
let's talk about uh the projects that

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,880
are highlighted here so the first one is

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,919
oran

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,280
as you know it's it's one of the largest

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,559
communities and the largest

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,080
alliances to disaggregate uh and open up

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,080
the rand which is one of the last

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,440
pieces of the puzzle in the telco

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,440
network uh

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,520
linux foundation hosts the software

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,559
community for oran

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,159
which is called oran sc

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,240
and the use cases that are being

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,919
produced created discussed there

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,240
are rg end-to-end slicing quality of

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,320
experience optimization how do different

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,960
white boxes come in etc

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,919
then you move on to you know kubernetes

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
openstack

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,400
you know sort of the cloud layer or or

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
the virtualization layer if you may

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,960
infrastructure there

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,240
and then you get into uh anuket which i

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,240
talked about open compliance

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,200
verification standardization

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,919
onboarding reference implementation uh

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,520
onap

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,120
i i won't talk about the control plane

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,320
projects you know they have been

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,440
proven and deployed in in for quite some

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,280
time now

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,640
but then when you get into onap you get

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,440
into 5g

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
network slicing cross cloud vpn zero

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,240
touch

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,280
close loop control loop you know lots of

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,679
these

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,039
real use cases that are needed for

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,039
network automation

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:17,440
and then on top obviously the magma

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,000
which is you know a critical piece of

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,840
the open source core wireless network so

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
you know these use cases are being done

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,919
in each of these projects

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
and you know our our goal is to bring it

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,919
all together

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,039
you move up into the uh or move out into

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,039
the edge of the

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,320
network you know you have a set of

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,679
projects that are

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,640
now trying to unify the edge across the

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,640
cloud

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,559
deployments across iot across the

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,039
enterprise and across telco

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,679
so think of you know these four markets

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,480
trying to

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,880
solve the same problem of plumbing life

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
cycle management onboarding etc for the

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,880
edge computing world right and i'll talk

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,520
about the definition in just a bit

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,760
but some of the examples include uh you

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,480
know virtualization on on-prem devices

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,640
anomaly detection right uh you have

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,919
projects like fledge that are doing

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,440
uh extremely constrained sensitive iot

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,440
type predictive maintenance

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,159
uh and and base monitoring right

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,400
turbines transformers pumps etc

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,159
uh or you have ajax foundry which is one

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,799
of the large projects under lfh that

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,280
would do

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:22,960
iot frameworks again all in the open

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,679
source for building automation

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:28,000
industrial process control smart cities

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,200
and then of course you have on the edge

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,600
crano

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,400
where you're going to build blueprints

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,880
for

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
testing out these various use cases and

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,640
deploying it

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,400
very very quickly so you can see that

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,280
all these use cases from

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,400
from from core to edge to access from

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,840
telecom to

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,200
enterprise they're all solving

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,600
um you know use cases and similar issues

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,880
that

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:59,039
are important to an end user

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,320
so let's uh take a moment and define the

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,000
edge

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,919
and this is important because you know

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,520
you will see very quickly that

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,960
you know when tina comes and talks about

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
an icn blueprint

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,120
under a crano it kind of uses

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,240
terminology that fits

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,960
together beyond what magma

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,679
you know defines in the core so this

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,799
diagram

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,799
is one of the most most screenshotted

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,559
diagram in this kind of new world of the

00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,080
pandemic right i wouldn't say the most

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,200
widely used but the most

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:32,320
screenshotted diagram that we have seen

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,159
on all these virtual presentations and

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,880
what it is is under an umbrella called

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,120
lfh

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,799
we have taken the community has taken

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:43,600
the liberty to define

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,279
the definitions in terms of an edge and

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,279
this is what the diagram shows

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,039
so if you look at the bottom uh there's

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,120
really two types of edges

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,200
uh and before i get into that you know

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,039
think of the terms that you have used

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,240
in edge you know thin edge thick edge

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,880
far edge near edge

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,919
you know all these are relative terms

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
and they don't mean

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,200
the same thing to everybody so what the

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,000
community did was they standardized on

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,919
definition

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
so we would really appreciate and you

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,440
know as magma

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,480
community as well as you know cncf

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,279
community

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,120
starts looking at edge computing to use

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:17,039
and utilize these terms because that's

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,720
what the edge community has done

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,400
so there's two types of edges there's a

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,559
user edge and then there's a service

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,400
provider at user edges dedicated and

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,880
operated by the user service provider

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,840
edge is shared and as a service

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,960
now the last smile separates these

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,000
typically but not

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,080
it's not a hard cut if you go

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,120
in the user edge it's not one

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,640
implementation

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,480
and that's part of the challenge we have

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,880
in the community but we have been

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,520
able to standardize across three

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,600
specific

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,799
implementation there is on the extreme

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,960
left

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,919
an edge that really has extreme

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,720
constraints

00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:55,600
right physical constraints uh resourcing

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,440
constraints memory compute etc

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,360
hardening constraints and that's called

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,960
constraint device edge

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,120
these could be microcontroller-based

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,080
this could be embedded compute etc

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,960
then you get into some more semi-secure

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,120
locations

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,480
where uh you know you may have an iot

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,840
gateway sitting around

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,400
still in the control of an enterprise

00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,159
user

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,760
or an iot user and there you may have

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,360
something called a smart device edge and

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:23,120
then if you

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,440
are a large enterprise or if you have

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,520
enough of these

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,640
factories buildings homes etc where you

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,400
have servers in a semi-secure location

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,919
then you have something called on-prem

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,799
data center edge

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,080
these are all again in the control of a

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,640
user as i said

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,520
and then if you move on across the last

00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,760
mile

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,039
you get into a couple of edges that are

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,120
very important here

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,120
one is the access network which is

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,320
really the ram so if you're putting

00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:54,799
edge compute below the ram and if you're

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,679
putting it in a smart central office

00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:59,679
about say

00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:02,480
one to six servers you can get

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,400
the about 20 milliseconds of latency

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,919
across the application

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,840
and that's very critical because 5g

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,360
really narrows down on the transmission

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,000
like see as we all know

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,760
so once you have that you can now have

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
edge computing all the way

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,200
to the smart central office anything

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,600
after that

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,919
the latency may be a tricky so i always

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,039
say you know an iot application

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:28,400
that dumps sensor data once a week is

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,080
not an edge application

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,559
it may be an iot application but it's

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,679
not an edge application

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,480
so with that said the projects shown

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,159
here

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,919
and i won't go into that because some of

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,600
them are relevant to magma's community

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,159
some of them are not some of them are

00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,640
relevant to the cncf community but the

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,400
more important thing here is

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,320
there is a different types of

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,840
constrained edges

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,679
everything from infrastructure to

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,400
application um

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,799
edgex foundry and crano being the the

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,080
two largest projects uh most mature if

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,240
you make stage three

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,520
and we have seen several other projects

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,720
moving up the pipeline

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,120
as well if you want to download the

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,080
whole

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,080
lf edge report we just published it

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,520
under lfi state of the edge

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,600
um and it's huge the market's huge and

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,799
we want to take advantage of that whole

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,120
edge computing

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,240
uh you know using using cncf projects

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,880
using lfn lf edge and more importantly

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,360
you know integrating with magma so i

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
really

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,799
i wanted to take this couple of minutes

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,919
to get into

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:38,960
uh explanation of the

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,440
the edge terminology

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,320
so with that said how do we pull this

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,840
all together

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,039
we pulled this all together in an

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,960
end-to-end solution in a project called

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,440
uh or i would say an initiative called

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,080
end to end 5g super blooper

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:57,440
um it's hosted by the linux foundation

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,440
networking so you can go to

00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,480
www.linuxfoundationnetworking.org

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:06,240
5g super blueprint it is

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,279
a task force it's a pro it's a it's a

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,080
it's a project that is extending

00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,960
um an existing governance under the

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,520
under the lfn

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,000
demo that we uh did but it's more than

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,840
the demo

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,600
it's now bringing components together

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,399
from an end-to-end perspective

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,120
that crosses lf networking lf edge magma

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
cncf

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,559
oran and a lot more okay these are just

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,919
some examples

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:31,440
um and what we're doing is we are

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,320
building this blueprint

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,159
in real time so we really encourage

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,200
everybody to participate in this

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,120
join mem you know as members if you want

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,840
to influence this even more under lf

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,559
networking but it is an open

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,840
open initiative to everybody so let me

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,480
walk you through

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:52,080
uh how magma is getting integrated into

00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,440
these components so here's the overall

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,159
roadmap

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,919
that the community has created lots of

00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,279
details are being worked in real time

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,760
because these projects

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,679
themselves have a roadmap so bringing

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:06,880
all these projects back together

00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,960
is obviously going to be a challenge

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,039
and and the reason we want to show it in

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,000
an open community is so that it can be

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,559
done under a neutral

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,480
governance and then you know we'll have

00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:19,360
vendors system integrators

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,480
end users doing distros doing you know

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,159
multiple things with it

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,520
linux foundation is not in the business

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,360
of that but

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:31,440
what we want to do is show a blueprint

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,919
that can easily pull projects together

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,440
upstream and downstream and solve

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,880
specific use cases

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,200
so here's how these things use look

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,320
the team's working on this quarter it's

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,960
working on getting

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,600
you know the 5g core and some version of

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,760
mac

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,720
integrated with a whole set of

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,679
components

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
that can bring an open source core stack

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,360
and edge

00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,559
stack together okay obviously 5g fixed

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,039
wireless access

00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,240
private 5g multi-access edge computing

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,039
iot etc

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,080
are primarily the use cases as we move

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,320
forward

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:11,440
we get into the end-to-end slicing uh

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,080
which brings um not just

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,120
uh the core but it also brings a set of

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,360
commercial brands

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,480
and from an open source perspective

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,360
end-to-end slicing

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,640
uh in play and then finally uh through

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,720
the q4 time

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:29,279
frame this brings not just the

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,360
en end to end network for rand but it

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,159
also opens up the ram with oram

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,880
sc software and it's a fully

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,520
disaggregated open source based 5g stack

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,080
so

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,840
uh with obviously all the use cases that

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,279
are required by the end user so let me

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,559
walk you through the three

00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,320
steps uh the first phase is uh

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,399
the following uh we're going to use

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,360
emulators for the ram

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,880
easy to do i mean easy to say hard to do

00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,240
but

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,320
those are sitting right there on the

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,480
left uh you come in

00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,360
and you bring in you know onap

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,480
onboarding

00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,559
through a project called uh openness

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,159
plus anoka then kubernetes bring it all

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,799
in um

00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,919
into magma magma orchestrator using the

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,760
access gateway

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:16,320
uh through the obviously the n6 and

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,320
obviously all the n interfaces

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,320
what is shown here on the akraino side

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,240
is icn and i'll have tina talk about

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,559
this in a lot more detail on how to do

00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,039
it

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,679
so i won't go into this uh but that's

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,600
kind of the

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,039
application control and application

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,240
layer and then on the bottom

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,080
you see the nfvi in the telco terms

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,519
right network function virtualization

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,159
infrastructure layer

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,039
which uses a whole bunch of what is

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,440
called

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,320
open source projects from data plane

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,640
acceleration to control plane to

00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:47,600
to storage etc so that's kind of the

00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,600
phase one

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,720
uh phase two is relatively

00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:53,840
straightforward

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,399
um uh but what you're doing is kind of

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,000
adding

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:58,559
two main things here one is you're

00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,480
adding the support for commercial ramps

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,640
and then the other thing you're doing is

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,519
adding end-to-end network slicing

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,720
which kind of comes from the magma road

00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,559
map

00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,039
onap already has support for the network

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,799
slicing magma is working on it

00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,799
and i think it comes together very

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,279
nicely and then finally

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,000
in phase three you include the oran

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,880
community

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,960
so today the over na1 interfaces from

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,919
oran to onap already

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,200
tested and and released there are other

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:29,360
interfaces that

00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,279
need to be worked out both for

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,919
non-real-time rick as well as real-time

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,159
rig but

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,080
more importantly uh bringing it in such

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,080
a way that it is a seamless end-to-end

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,279
use case across these projects

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,480
so very ambitious to participate

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,519
uh it's part of lf networking's uh

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,559
initiative and there's a large community

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,600
uh that is working on it uh you know if

00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,760
if you need to uh look at

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,279
anything particular or cannot find

00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,679
anything you know obviously reach out to

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,000
me

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,960
but that's kind of the ambition we have

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,200
on

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,559
on doing this end-to-end blueprints so

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,720
with that i'm going to

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,799
hand it over to tina to

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,760
you know walk you through some of the

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,279
specifics

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,760
of one example of a crano

00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,440
and magma coming together under an under

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,159
a blueprint called icn

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:23,919
and and she's going to walk you through

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,720
uh the rest of the blueprints as well

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,720
because they are

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
um you know all not all of them are

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,240
relevant to magma

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,039
but it gives you a good perspective of

00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,559
how

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,640
acrino is setting up uh dip various use

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,080
cases when we have connected cars to

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:40,960
gaming to

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,039
um augmented reality classrooms you know

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,080
all the cool use cases that edge is

00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,519
known for

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,440
uh so she's going to walk you through

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,200
that and

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,679
again if there's any questions we'll

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:54,720
come back and and kind of do this

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,600
so again i'll i'm going to pass it over

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,640
to tina

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,159
and uh you know she'll she'll do a deep

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,919
dive on this

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:07,120
thank you thank you appit

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,320
this is how equino are four blueprints

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,440
available now we announced in

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,119
uh february 24th so from here

00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,679
you can see um see

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,960
there are four blueprints which which

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,839
are new

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,240
is indeed indicated in blue so you can

00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,200
see

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,159
the industry iot predictive maintenance

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,760
blueprint

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:35,839
sits on the smart device edge and

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,839
it has been integrated

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:42,720
if and if

00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:46,000
in flesh so it supports for the

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,159
industry iot case like when

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,040
the temperature is up it will give

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,720
indication an

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:56,079
alarm to the backhand like a gcp

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,720
and the other new one the air edge

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,359
autonomous vehicle the ivix which

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,560
support

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,839
uh integrate the uh

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:07,680
auto dot where um

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,160
outerwear the auto sorry otherwise the

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,880
auto and the federated landing

00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,400
a which has been deployed in the

00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,920
financial technologies

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,960
has been widely deployed by we bank

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,079
the other one the icm private fight glt

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,000
i'm gonna talk about this a lot and

00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:30,880
later slides it could be edge support ai

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,760
and the etc and the highway the

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,040
electronic

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,000
collected control

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,040
it has been uh deployed in the cloud and

00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,760
in the edge

00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:43,200
the public cloud edge interface here

00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,000
sitting above the

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,520
public cloud core part and public cloud

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,320
edge part

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,680
which has provided api's orchestrations

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,880
for the telcos

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,839
and hyperscalers to work together via

00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,200
pcs

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,920
layer and the other one we have the kni

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,880
industry edge which is a new which is

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,480
new

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,599
to support uh operator in france about

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,839
their deployment

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,000
for the industry iot and also the

00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,560
manufacturing

00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,040
okay and the green one are the existing

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,359
our

00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:22,400
r1r2sr3 enhanced enhanced blueprints

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,599
uh we are still developing and making

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,880
them more mature

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:30,800
and adding more use cases and hardening

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,480
the code okay

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,839
this is private lte5gicn the purpose

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,800
is to create an epc 5g in a box

00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,440
to enable enterprises and operates to

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,560
deploy

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:48,320
lte 5g there are we use it

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,760
we use oss like 35gc and magma

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:54,079
so magma has been used here and also

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,680
free by gc you can see the

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,040
infrastructure orchestration

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,320
include ironic miter 3 and cluster api

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,119
string could be

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,400
so this is quite white and also the onap

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,640
has been used as

00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,440
orchestration layer we covered the

00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,440
network segments all the way from ucpe

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,480
using kubernetes on the network edge

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,200
number one

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,640
and cross the network call which runs

00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:20,160
the kubernetes as the

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,200
as the e1 the epc 5gc there

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:25,280
and same as edge number one and

00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,119
the other side of the network is the

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,760
network engine number two

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,480
in this case we can support the many

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,839
industry

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,079
the manufacturing retail farming and

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,160
mining

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,119
so i would like to talk about this uh

00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,560
private lt

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:50,400
e5g icm blueprint this is our

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:53,119
mvp plan you can see from here

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,640
um the onap openness is orchestration

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,400
layer and kubernetes is the

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,400
orchestration for the containers

00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,280
we have the kubernetes plus open

00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,880
openness with the good

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,200
infra orchestration and the magma sits

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,160
on top of it for example we open this

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,040
cnf number one to have a look so we have

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,440
the magmod

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,520
orchestration orchestrator on the top

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,040
and sitting on top of the

00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:26,640
agw for 5g the smf

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,760
and amf and upf is at the controller

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,880
layer and data plan layer

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,920
so it connects with the other cn2

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,359
cnf number two with the m1 interface

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,599
to the 5g ue emulator and through the n2

00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,359
interface to genome b emulator

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,000
so the n3 is between the gm genome b

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,079
and emulator to the upf directory and

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,800
the upf interconnect with the data

00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,440
network

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,079
so this is runs the bnf number one and

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,680
magma

00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:01,280
sits for the cnf number number one

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:05,040
so the workflow is like this number one

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:08,640
we first installed the uh the the kubiaf

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,640
kubf number one and two and then uh we

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,920
installed onap and encode as the

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,800
orchestrator

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,440
uh after that we registered it could be

00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,320
uh

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,200
kobe ref number two could be ref2 with

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,560
the onap and

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,640
aimco and we onboard cnf one and two you

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:27,920
can see from here

00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,400
and also bnf number one in this case we

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:34,079
can create a network service with

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:36,720
uh cnl for vms and we can deploy

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,200
the network services like what you can

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,680
think about for the 5g private lte

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:47,119
like manufacturing etc

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,440
and then we registered the awg

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,320
with the magma orchestrator this is

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,920
important

00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,520
to interact with magma and finally

00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,640
manually configured awg and run the ue

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:04,160
gene node b test this is the

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:07,440
minimum the workflow the minimum

00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,680
data flow for our private lte 5g

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,880
integrated magma

00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,160
okay here we can see the

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:22,240
magma integration plan details

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:25,839
the magma awg 5g early implementation

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,160
available as a vm like here is a vnf

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:29,359
also the magma orchestrator early

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,839
implementation

00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,720
available as a container we call it cnf

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,000
of course

00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,680
and the private lte 5g icmt

00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,240
which is our blueprinting

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,040
part of ice and blueprint family will

00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,400
orchestrate

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,640
these two using onap the uen

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,480
and genome the b emulator will also be

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,359
orchestrated as a cnf

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,319
let's see the previous page as a cnf

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,359
number two

00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,400
if available uh in a containerized form

00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:04,000
so this is our uh detailed plan so

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:07,280
lfh and equinox community

00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,079
are very excited to have magma to join

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,880
the lf

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,839
and collaborate on innovative blueprints

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,480
to provide

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,200
these end-to-end solutions thank you

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,839
again

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,960
for the opportunity to discuss this here

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,119
at the magma day

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,119
