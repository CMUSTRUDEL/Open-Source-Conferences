my name is daniel vergara i'm a director

00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
at everest and i want to talk to you

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,160
about magma and dsi

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,759
accessories at aries we have worked with

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,679
the telecom operators for quite an

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,720
amount of time

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,440
in commercial areas financial customer

00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,720
apps

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
and of course the network in the network

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,960
we have played a role

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,840
mostly in oss and that's great i really

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,240
like

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,640
the automation you can drive with oss

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,359
the the the way in which systems can

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,079
really

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,239
change the way in which we do stuff and

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,160
the ways in which we um

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,680
manage the different processes that

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,520
involve the network

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,399
but we have always tried to go a lot

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,879
deeper inside of the network

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,680
to actually deploy network solutions

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,920
because we have

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,800
typically been seen as a system

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,800
integrator

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,120
we have been seen mostly as software

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,239
engineers that will only deploy

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,920
the things that have been already built

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,920
with magma we have really seen an

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,720
opportunity to change this

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,920
and i want to go through main the main

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,640
three things in which

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,439
we we believe that are key to understand

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,680
how magma

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,560
changes the way in which the telecom

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,159
sector does

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,240
things specifically for the si

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,080
the first thing will be the ways in

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,640
which we see magma helps

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,000
connect the unconnected the second thing

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,240
will be to

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,040
understand the simplicity that magma

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,400
brings

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,960
to a size that which helps us in playing

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,079
a more important role and the third

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,560
thing will be

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,200
the disruption it represents for the

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,439
whole

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,479
um telecom um sector

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,520
so how is it that magma helps connect

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
the unconnected

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,600
of course you find yourself um i don't

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,720
know

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,720
going into magma different assets and

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,560
trying to understand what it does

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,719
and you find yourself understanding that

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,520
is actually a portion of the network

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,600
that was open sourced so that is really

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,000
important for the telco sector

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
because it will help in defining new

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,679
ways

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,800
to deliver services so it will

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,200
it actually enables ways to implement

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
services that were typically harder to

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,000
implement for example

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,520
to uh rural use cases you will find

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,520
yourself finding for example

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,800
um low low arpu

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,239
use cases in which you will you will

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,280
need to implement a

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,040
and not so cost effective platform to

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,959
deliver that service to end customers

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
with magma you can do so because you can

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,760
actually think about your solution

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,879
and be able to actually define what are

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
the specific needs

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,319
of that specific sector you want to

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,560
attain and implement

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,440
a customized solution for that that will

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,440
complain

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,440
not only with technological issues but

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,519
also with financial

00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,560
and business issues that that you

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,360
might find yourself um going through

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
with traditional solutions the second

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,680
thing

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,800
is the simplicity for dsi so we have we

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:12,319
have found

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,200
a lot of learning uh while while using

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,599
magma because

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,920
we really see that it has an

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,280
architecture that helps you understand

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,000
the different pieces

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
that really simplifies how to how they

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,599
connect to one another

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,840
the concept of abstractions is really

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,760
really interesting to to understand

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,200
it's really really interesting to to to

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,239
see how that

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,280
makes you able as a system integrator

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:40,480
to play with the core network so

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,120
with that in mind you can have

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
more power inside the different

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,239
solutions because you can build things

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,200
on top of magma

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,280
and also find new and most more more

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,239
efficient ways to build whatever is on

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,720
the bottom

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,720
of the the the for example the access

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
gateway or the orchestrator

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,319
or or even the federation gateway to

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200
connect with the rest of the rest of the

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,720
network

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,040
so that is really important for an si

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,360
to have such architectures and to have

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,680
that you know in an open source fashion

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,959
and the third thing of course is the

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,239
disruption

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,840
it represents not only for operators but

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,359
also for verticals

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,560
when we say the telecom sector

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,320
it is no longer only teleco operators it

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,479
is no longer only a size

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
it is no longer only vendors but also

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,600
the verticals

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,080
so it is a disruption because you can

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,960
find an open source solution

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,520
that has a really clean code a really

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,919
important way to implement it

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,759
in terms of how modern it is and

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,520
gives you a lot of control on on how

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,479
things are done and on and how to do

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,720
more things on top of it

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,800
it is it is also important to keep in

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
mind that it's really easy to integrate

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,400
with the rest of the telco operators in

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,680
the case of tech operators

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,560
and existing infrastructure because it

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,600
was already

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,639
a thought so you you can find

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,080
yourself building things that are really

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,600
simple to implement because

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,840
it has components to actually do that

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,039
to actually integrate with the rest of

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,520
the solutions

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
and of course the er especially in the

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,000
specific point

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,240
the things that has to do for example

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
ways to integrate the data ways to

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,639
integrate the metrics ways to integrate

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,840
the

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,000
the alarms it is really easy as again

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,880
we have always a solution for example

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,600
like average

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,160
that connects seamlessly to magma

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
because

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,400
we understand how it's built from the

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,360
core not only

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,320
not only the interfaces and the last

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,320
thing that i find

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,240
really really important to point is that

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,440
we have seen actually seen that it

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:59,280
dramatically increases or enhances

00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,400
time to market so you will find yourself

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,720
as a size er or as an operator of course

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,800
that

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,400
wants to have an site to do to do things

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,479
with them um

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,800
you will find that the times of the time

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,720
to market will be increased because

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,199
magma helps in uh having more control

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,039
on what the si the operator and the

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
vendor actually the different vendors of

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,440
other solutions can

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,160
uh for example from software solutions

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,199
also

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,880
uh can can can know how how things

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,360
actually happens internally

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,120
and find simple ways to do many things

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,800
so you can find

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,800
yourself building i don't know a private

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,080
network really easy for 5g

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,319
or you can find yourself building a 4g

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,400
for fixed wireless access also really

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,680
easy and you can find yourself

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,160
actually getting into the magma code and

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,960
changing the way the way it works so

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,800
that it does

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,319
things a little bit differently to what

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,440
they do right now

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:59,280
so you have full control of everything

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
you can participate in the different

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,680
communities it's an open community of

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,400
course

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,240
and of course you can help tech

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,440
operators and verticals

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,440
to reach their important use cases

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,240
to connect the unconnected and to drive

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,479
revenues and of course also margins

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,440
thank you very much this is diabetes
