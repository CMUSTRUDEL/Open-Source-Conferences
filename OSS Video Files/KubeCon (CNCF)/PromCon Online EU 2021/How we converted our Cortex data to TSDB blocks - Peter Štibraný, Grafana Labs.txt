How we converted our Cortex data to TSDB blocks - Peter Štibraný, Grafana Labs

Cortex has recently gained support for storing data in Prometheus TSDB format (using so-called "blocks engine", also reusing some parts of Thanos). In Grafana Labs, we had hundreds of terabytes of data in previous format, and we wrote scalable tooling to convert it all to TSDB blocks. In the talk, I would like to present the tooling, show some details from Prometheus TSDB internals, and show how simple it is to generate TSDB blocks using Go code and what pitfalls to avoid.
