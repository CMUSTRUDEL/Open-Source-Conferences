Lightning Talk: Load testing your Prometheus Remote Write endpoints - Daniel González Lopes, k6.io

"Remote write storage is supported by several systems (Cortex, Thanos, M3DB, InfluxDB) and since 2.25.0 by Prometheus itself.
​
In this lightning talk, you will learn how to load test these systems using the open-source tool k6 and its fresh new xk6 remote write extension. Also, we'll briefly talk about additional use cases and how to export the results to Prometheus."
