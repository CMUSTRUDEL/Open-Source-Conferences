Lightning Talk: Using Prometheus to Automate Power Capacity Planning - Tim Calazza, Hudson River Trading

At Hudson River Trading, we manage a large amount of physical resources and we are typically constrained by the amount of power available to us in a given rack. In the past all the power capacity planning needed to be manual. Using the snmp_exporter, textfile collector and a bunch of recording rules we are able to normalize power metrics across the many different vendors of PDUs we use to a consistent metric as a percentage of available power. The resulting percentage available power metrics makes it easy to build dashboards and tools to automate the process of find racks with available power.
