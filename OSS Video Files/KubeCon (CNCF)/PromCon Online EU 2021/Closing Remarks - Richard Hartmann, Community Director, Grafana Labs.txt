00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,240

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,000

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
the sponsors but also to cncf staff

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,599
the bits and pieces which are usually

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,800
invisible because probably this team and

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,800
such

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,240
we get some visibility in all these

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
things but

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,079
cncf does not um at least not at the

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,960
forefront

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,559
these are the local times at least uh

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,079
seven minutes in the future

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,800
the local times of um of the people

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,520
actually responsible for

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,360
for prom con colleen is already and this

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,079
is not like in the morning this is like

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,239
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,680

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,239

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
with emily taking over and they passing

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,120
over the baton but

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,440
anyway um it's not nice to to be

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,400
in this situation because as most of you

00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,840
will have noticed

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,400
without travel you just have normal work

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,960
interfere all the time or private life

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,159
and such

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,000
and it's even worse for the organizers i

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,840
speak from our own experience so

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,200
yeah a massive thank you to to everyone

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,200
who helped make this happen

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,479
yes yet again the reminder

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,000
that even though like all of this was

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,799
super interesting all of this was super

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,400
inspiring and

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,640
i need to do a lot of reading on stuff

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,479
but also there is still this kind of

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,759
little pandemic going on so yes please

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,079
reach out to your friends family

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,200
co-workers whoever because

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,360
some people are in super harsh spots and

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,520
as you know you should be excellent to

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
each other

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,720
speaking of being excellent to each

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,680
other there

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,520
is the buff which i've been told

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
normally people would need to register

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,119
for

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,840
but um we decided to just make it open

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,320
so this is the thing and i'll also toss

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
this

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,599
into into um into chat

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:13,440
um let me do this now and that's

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,720
it so i'll just babble a little while i

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,680
copy this over

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,680

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,840

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,959
