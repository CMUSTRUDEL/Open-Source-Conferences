Observability for Air Conditioners: An IoT Story with Talos - William Gathright, Talos IoT

The internet of things (IoT) is all about connecting real-world objects to get timeseries data out of them.  And what better thing to do with timeseries data than feed it to Prometheus?  Hear the story of how start-up company Talos IoT is applying Prometheus and the rest of the observability stack to critical equipment like air conditioners.  The talk covers why Prometheus is a natural fit for IoT data before going into some of the challenges that happen when we stop monitoring Kubernetes Pods and start getting real!

	00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,840
i recently asked a buddy of mine if he

00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,440
had ever heard of prometheus

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,960
and he said yeah you know that's the

00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,400
thing that people use to monitor

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,040
kubernetes clusters right well so sort

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,200
of right

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,360
i mean he was right that prometheus has

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,440
become the de facto standard

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,560
for that particular use case but i'm

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,000
sure that it's you know

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,080
no surprise to this group that you can

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,960
use prometheus for so much more than

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,599
that

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,640
so my name is will gethright i'm the cto

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,320
at talos

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,679
and today i'm going to lay out just sort

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,800
of my personal experience

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,160
using prometheus as really like the

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,480
mission critical

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,640
core of the tech stack of an iot startup

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,440
so maybe i'll set the table a little bit

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,760
here let's start by setting a few goals

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,280
for commercial and industrial iot in

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,360
general and then i'm going to talk about

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,600
my specific use case

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,079
so for many established companies out

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,559
there their iot transformation

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,440
it's it's really just beginning right i

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,199
mean

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:04,720
a commercial building represents a huge

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,200
data store but almost all of that data

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,000
is locked up in little metal boxes and

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,159
it's completely inaccessible

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,799
so that being the sort of state of the

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,720
world that's the state of the market

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,000
right there's actually a lot of value in

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,960
just making that

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,520
data available and then performing some

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,560
basic

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,000
services on it right i'll give you

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,000
maybe an example would help here so i'll

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,600
give you an example from my own work

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,600
so telos uses iot kind of technologies

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,799
for automatic fault detection and

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,280
diagnostics

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,400
of mission critical equipment and we're

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,960
starting with

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,720
hvacs right heating and air conditioning

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,159
units

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,360
what we do is we start off with a small

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,360
sensor board so one of these gets

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,399
installed into every hvac cabinet

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,520
and this lets us

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,520
send data from a few different sensors

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
so a few different electrical sensors

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,399
and temperature sensors

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,399
up to the cloud and you can tell a

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,640
surprising amount about the health of an

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,280
hvac unit just from a few temperature

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
and and electrical current readings

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
right

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,040
so once this data is in the cloud we can

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,879
analyze it against

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,800
a few different sets of rules one set of

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,599
rules was handcrafted

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,560
by hvac experts and then another one was

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
learned

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
based on the performance the past

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,720
performance of this you know that

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,760
particular unit

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,760
and then similar units

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,720
so your hvac in a commercial or

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,360
industrial building it's really a

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,760
critical piece of mechanical machinery

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,400
right climate control is just absolutely

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,080
crucial

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,080
to many industrial processes and

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,760
a good you know many buildings

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,120
especially here in you know here in the

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,599
west here in america

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,200
they become completely uninhabitable

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
when the hvac goes down

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,319
right i mean one of the one of the

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,560
hallmarks of so-called class a

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
office space is that you can't open the

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,280
windows you can't actually get

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,080
ventilation into the building

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
by design this is a selling feature so

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,599
you

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,640
you gotta leave if the hvac dies

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,000
uh at the same time your hvac is really

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
hard to monitor

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
right i mean if you think about an hvac

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,280
it's typically

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,120
up on the roof of the building or it's

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
some place very difficult to get to

00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,760
maybe tucked behind the building

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,840
and it can take a trained technician to

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,760
really be able to see if the unit is

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
healthy or not right your sort of

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,040
typical person

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,959
doesn't doesn't quite know enough about

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
the refrigeration cycle to diagnose one

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
of these things

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,319
so this represents a big operational

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,080
risk doesn't it

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,760
on the one hand you have a completely

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,400
critical piece of equipment

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,159
for the functioning of a building on the

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,440
other hand it's difficult and expensive

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,200
to assess the health of it because of

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,720
this because of you know this sort of

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
this this this trade-off there's many

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
companies that just choose to run their

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,959
equipment to failure

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,799
and yeah you know they have to deal with

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,879
the occasional emergency sometimes it

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,439
dies when you really wish it hadn't

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,159
uh but that's expensive right so the

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
current

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,920
sort of state of the art the current

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,959
best practice in the industry

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,319
is to perform quarterly preventive

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,200
maintenance so this is where a

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,519
technician

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
goes to a unit and lays on hands you

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,040
know really whether the unit needs it or

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,960
not

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,199
and that's that's the cycle that we're

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,440
trying to break here right so

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,440
by using you know some of these iot

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,240
devices we can perform preventive

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,919
maintenance

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
essentially once a minute instead of

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,240
once a quarter and that's going to make

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,000
this equipment a lot more reliable

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
and it's also going to make technicians

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
a lot more productive right because then

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,479
they can only go have to service the

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
units

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,160
that actually need their help

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,840
um but you know maybe of interest to

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,680
this crowd the most is we can actually

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,639
do one step better than that can't we

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,320
we can we can take this new very rich

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,040
data set and

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,840
track the time series data that comes

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,080
off of it

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,759
now time series data is so much more

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,680
useful than maybe static data for

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,600
assessing the health of any machine

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,680
because you can pick out you can pick

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,120
out trends right

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,120
so an hvac has two very important you

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,560
know we'll call them pipes or lines

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,560
that carry the refrigerant these are

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,160
called the suction liquid line

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,600
and if you come up to me or any

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,240
technician and you tell me

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,840
that the difference in temperature

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,160
between the suction line and liquid line

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,680
is 25 degrees fahrenheit

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
then i mean i don't know i have to tell

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
you that the unit's probably fine

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,960
whatever

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
that's a lot but if you tell me that the

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,160
difference

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,960
is 25 degrees fahrenheit but it's

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,440
falling at

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
five degrees per hour i can tell you

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,759
that you're leaking refrigerant uh in a

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
in a pretty severe way actually like you

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,840
need to get that thing patched up right

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,840
now

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,800
it's gonna it's gonna die it's gonna

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,600
fail

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,800
so a quick summary what's the tldr

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,919
industrial iot

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,240
is about exposing and analyzing

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,919
time series data that used to be

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,360
difficult or impossible to gather

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,520
from real world equipment so

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,360
some version of that statement was what

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,880
my co-founder came to me with when we

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,280
started telus

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
and you know that was my that was

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,919
essentially my job that was my charge

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,919
was to was to

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,680
figure out how to serve this data and

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,160
track it and deal with it

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
and after setting up a few prototypes

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,560
based on different

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,319
types of text stacks the

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
you know we really had sort of an aha

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,800
moment

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,919
at the most abstract

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,319
what the goal is is to track metrics

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,759
about a metal box that is connected to

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,120
the internet right that's what this does

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,319
is it connects that metal box to the

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
internet

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,000
so the aha moment is that servers

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,440
right computer servers internet servers

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,360
also happen to be

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,960
metal boxes that are connected to the

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,479
internet they're out there in the world

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,840
they're invisible to the people using

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,199
them for the most part

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,120
right and the world of

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,400
we'll call it site reliability

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,680
engineering

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,520
is actually very very good at this job

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,560
so my job then became to just see what

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,680
kind of tools

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,639
those folks use and that's how i found

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,120
prometheus

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,039
and its you know and its ecosystem right

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,319
so we use prometheus cortex

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,599
and grafana and this turned out to be

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,919
uh a pretty perfect fit so let's go on a

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,919
quick

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,440
a quick tour here of kind of what we

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,840
know what we built how we use these

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,840
tools

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,280
now it all starts with something that

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,880
most people are

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,479
pretty used to looking at right this is

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,599
sort of an interactive map we use google

00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,280
maps

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,759
and instead of driving directions we can

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,240
now give directions to broken hvacs

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,759
so these are hvac units just like any

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
others out there except that we have

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,759
these

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,000
talos these you know these guardian

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,680
sensor boards on them

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,520
there's only a few units pictured here

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
in my demo but it's easy to imagine this

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,960
scaling to hundreds or thousands of

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,479
units nationwide

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,319
right you can just put them all on the

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,319
map and have a good way to track them

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
the units that are working fine are here

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759
in green so

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,280
this is one here in my office and i can

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,280
confirm that i'm quite comfortable

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
and here across town instead of having

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,680
to drive to this unit we can zoom in on

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,000
it

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,599
and we can tell that this unit's an

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,440
alarm this unit is having

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,440
some trouble right

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,800
so let's check it out

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,320
so here's the unit i can tell you that

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,839
we got

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,680
unit you know data from this unit

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,720
recently

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:47,120
we can again confirm the location of it

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,040
and i have the key metrics that i want

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
coming off of here right so i can see

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
how much

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:54,160
electrical current uh the unit's using

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,920
for you hvac geeks out there

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,200
we've separated the compressor right

00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
that's the sort of the

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,120
the the beating heart of the hvac if you

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
will from the indoor fan motor and

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,120
outdoor fan motor

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,279
and here's the you know the sort of

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:09,120
formation liquid and suction lines

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,399
along with the outdoor air temperature

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,080
that we're picking up from

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,480
from a local weather station so

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,680
we can run some basic analytics on this

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,760
we can see some faults

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,440
so let's see here's the first fault the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,160
first fault is that

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,000
this compressor is on a lot of the time

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
even though it's only 70 degrees

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,760
fahrenheit that's bad

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,120
because if the next day were to be say

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,839
90 degrees fahrenheit

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,040
which is uncomfortably warm the the

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,680
people in this building are going to be

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,519
hot right so this is a classic use case

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,720
the people in this building are still

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,240
comfortable on this

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,279
on this day that i've selected this data

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,480
from so nobody knows there's a problem

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,279
but we do i can predict a failure

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,000
because if this

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,360
is you know if the day gets much hotter

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,839
then

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,480
the the hvac won't be able to keep up

00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,000
all right it's very bad side

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,839
i can also see that the liquid line is

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
much hotter than the outdoor air

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
temperature

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,640
so here the liquid line is you know

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,000
almost 100 degrees fahrenheit

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,440
outdoor temperature is 70. this tells me

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,560
that the unit is having trouble

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,120
rejecting heat

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,720
back into the air and so i would want to

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
send a technician to this site

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,240
to give it a cleaning clean the

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,079
condenser coil

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
all right the last thing we can see here

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,519
is that the suction line is actually a

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,160
little bit too warm at 60 degrees

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
you really want that at about 45 degrees

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,519
because it's impossible for an air

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,880
conditioner to make 55 degree

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,200
fahrenheit air which is what it's

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,079
designed to do if the

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
suction line is hotter than that we'll

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,480
keep going

00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,600
just see one other one other interesting

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
thing that we were able to pick up on

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,200
this unit

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,480
was this example here so here we see

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
that the indoor fan motor is actually

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,320
pegging out my sensor my sensor can only

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,560
detect 50 amps it's maxed it out

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,160
this is a condition called locked rotor

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,440
amps

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,959
without getting into too many of the

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,040
details you just have to know that this

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,959
is a bad thing but it's a very fleeting

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,839
state this lasts only for a very short

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,360
period of time

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,880
and it's hard to detect unless you

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
happen to be standing right there

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,079
listening for it and we were able to

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
detect this thing

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,880
you know pulling locked ramps twice in a

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,560
row it means the fan motor is going to

00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
die you got to go replace it fan motor

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,240
dies

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,279
you got no cold air right so it looks

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,120
like this unit could

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,720
use some service and we were able to

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,240
diagnose it from

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,680
from you know the comfort of my office

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,839
all the way across town that's the

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,680
miracle of iot

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:33,040
fantastic use case right

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,160
and prometheus is actually a perfect

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,200
fit for this use case so with a little

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,160
bit of planning

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
you can get extremely powerful behavior

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,640
for monitoring

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,680
a fleet of iot devices like this

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,040
so again in my experience

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,720
i don't pretend to be an expert at this

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,600
stuff but there were two things that

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,000
attracted me

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,639
to prometheus so the first one was

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
really how

00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,399
easy it is to administer the alerts

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
all you have to do pull this back up

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,920
here

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,760
all you have to do is just you know edit

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,920
your yaml file hit reload

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,279
you get tons of this rich behavior for

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,200
free you get

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,959
reliable evaluation you get these alert

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,920
delays you get silences deduplication

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,360
the whole deal

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,279
it all sort of works out of the box

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,200
right which is which is which is

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:24,000
really nice it's really powerful um

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:26,240
the second was the query language itself

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,560
right promql is

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,240
really a remarkable tool so it takes a

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
little bit of a learning curve but once

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,160
you get your head

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
wrapped around it you know promql is

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,360
really a rich

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,399
and expressive and powerful language

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,000
right so let's

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
let's kind of you know maybe for the

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,760
second part of this talk i wanted to go

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,200
over

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
go over an example for you

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,959
so let's start to craft an alert

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,959
yeah so

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,800
you know in the you know in the hvac

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,440
world here

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,800
right when your suction line gets is

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,480
what gets cold right that's what i

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,399
mentioned earlier the suction line is

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,920
ideally like 45 degrees

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,839
once it hits 32 degrees bad things start

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,360
to happen because at 32 fahrenheit

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:16,880
things you know water starts to freeze

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,240
it will freeze out of the air

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,120
it's going to turn your hvac into a

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,040
block of ice if the when the hvac turns

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
off that block of ice is going to melt

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,639
now you have a bunch of water it can

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,040
cause water damage it can cause mold

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,399
you really want to avoid this um but

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
these sort of freeze thaw

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,079
cycles i've seen them take place you

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,519
know out in the wild

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,279
over weeks and months just because

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,839
nobody knows they're happening

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,519
the unit's still pumping out cold air so

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,440
the people in the building don't notice

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,560
it's just really struggling and now the

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,839
building owner

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,120
has a bunch of mold damage sucks so you

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,760
really want to avoid this

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,600
so ideally we could alert somebody if we

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,800
detect that there is ice

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,639
on the suction line so let's look at

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,079
how we might go about doing this right

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,440
what would our first before

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,920
before we even start to think about the

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,920
rule what's our metric going to look

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,199
like

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,639
well the design decision that we made

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,440
was to define a single metric per

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,959
equipment type so the type of equipment

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,000
that we were dealing with

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:23,760
here right this this

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,959
this equipment right here that use oops

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,560
that you see on the screen um that

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,000
is called a package unit it's a rooftop

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,440
package unit right it's just

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,920
it's one of these big metal boxes that

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,920
you see on commercial rooftops

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,240
and so let's define a gauge metric for

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:42,880
the equipment

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,839
of a package unit so we'll call it you

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,839
know

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,959
okay now

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:58,560
each of these sensors so all you know

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,519
all data from all packagings that i'm

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,199
monitoring will

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,079
come to this metric

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,720
this gauge and each of these sensor

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,600
boards

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,320
it has an individual id number i call we

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,360
call this

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,040
the device eid the device entity id and

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,079
so in order to distinguish between

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,760
different data streams

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:26,240
we will we will

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:29,600
define you know device eid equals

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
whatever it is okay

00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,160
so this is how this is how we can again

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,360
distinguish data coming off of

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,320
let's say this unit from this unit

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,320
from this unit from the unit across town

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,519
okay so quick aside here i'm sure that

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
the

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,880
observability nerds in the audience are

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,399
going to be really quick to point out

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,480
that this is technically

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,240
unbounded cardinality that's a very good

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,600
catch right very smart pat yourself on

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,880
the back you are technically correct

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,880
which is of course the best kind of

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,600
correct

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,680
we have made the business decision that

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,959
if this startup is so successful

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,560
that we have so many units out there

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,079
that this becomes a problem then we'll

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,440
have plenty of money to pay all you you

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,120
know one of you all to come in

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,040
and and you know patch this up for us

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,519
so you know quick aside but yes that is

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,040
a you know that is a known danger of

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,040
of doing exactly this

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,120
okay there's also

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,800
so the other thing we have to keep in

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,519
mind back to our back to our metric

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,079
design

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,680
is that there's many data points that

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,360
come off of a single

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,720
unit right we're doing the temperature

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,759
of the suction line liquid line we're

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,120
doing a few different

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,240
you know seat amp readings ct readings

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,240
so we have to add another label

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,079
so the label that we want here is going

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,360
to be we can call it like

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,800
let's say point equals

00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,920
suction f okay so here we go now we've

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,120
individually found the you know the the

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,439
gauge and the labels that would define

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,559
you know this sensor port for that

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,720
particular unit

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,799
it's very precise fantastic so

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,160
if we just say that this in any we're

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,439
going to alert whenever this is less

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,160
than 32

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,480
and let's say all all we have to do is

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,480
add

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,480
a little four clause and a bunch of

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,640
labels

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,200
some annotations and we're done right

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,320
ship it go live

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,320
so maybe not quite okay first of all

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,400
let's generalize this so this is an

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,080
alert for one particular device

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,120
but all i have to do is blow away this

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,320
piece of logic and now this is valid for

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,440
every package unit in the fleet very

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,600
powerful

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,640
but unfortunately the logic is still not

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:58,000
quite right

00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:01,200
so what if this is let's say a

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,679
cold winter day now no cooling is going

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,679
to go on

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,679
on a cold winter day but the suction

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,880
line is just a piece of copper exposed

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,960
to the elements

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,160
it's going to get at least where we live

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,520
in richmond virginia

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:16,160
it's going to get below freezing so

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,640
this will you know this condition will

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,799
fire

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,679
at that point it's an alert but you

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,919
don't want to that would be

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,960
in this case a false alarm right really

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,960
bad

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,960
so let's put in a little bit more logic

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,880
uh to to prevent this right that's not

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,600
an alert condition if the day happens to

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,679
be cold

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,120
in fact it's only an alert condition if

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,960
the hvac unit is

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,520
running and then the suction line

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,400
freezes so no problem

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,919
right let's add a little bit more logic

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
so let's say

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:50,480
that we want this to be

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:54,320
you know what we want and

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,320
uh we want to quit

00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:02,559
package in this case let's say that the

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,799
compressor amps have to be greater than

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,799
one

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,960
and for the very eagle-eyed among you

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,520
you would realize that we have to do

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,640
this on

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,080
device eid all right so now for any

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,400
device eid

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,760
right it only compares those devices the

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,559
particular device the id here

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,000
particular device i idea here now when

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,559
the suction line is

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,960
cold and the unit is using electrical

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,640
power

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
right amps are greater than one one's a

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,600
very small number of amps for a

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,440
compressor to be using so we know it's

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,880
on

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
then we're gonna we're gonna get it

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,400
right we're gonna get an alert fantastic

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,919
right and this rule actually looks

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,240
pretty good in fact i

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,080
put a um a version of this rule into

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,200
production once upon a time

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,160
but when we did fortunately we caught it

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,360
the problem before it became an issue we

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,120
actually ran into a little bit of a

00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,960
gotcha

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,960
and this one's a little bit more subtle

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,159
data coming off of an iot sensor

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
especially one with a wireless

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,159
connection

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:09,200
is not 100 reliable

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:11,039
so just because you scrape an endpoint

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,559
that lives in the cloud which is what

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,200
prometheus is doing it's not

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,640
actually scraping this device in my use

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
case it's scraping an endpoint that

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,440
lives in the cloud

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,159
it doesn't mean you're getting fresh

00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,640
data it could mean

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,240
that the sensor is failing to send data

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,840
for whatever reason right you can end up

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,440
with stale data

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,280
and a lot's been written about stale

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,360
data in prometheus i'm not going to

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
retread all of that here

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,720
so my greater point is that this is

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,240
actually a pretty big

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,320
you know issue in the iot world is this

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,120
notion of stale data

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,799
to work around this i actually

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,600
separately defined

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,360
another metric that is going to keep

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,880
track of the timestamp at which i

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,640
received a data point

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:58,960
um i do this in seconds since the epoch

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:02,559
so we're going to call this metric

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:05,039
we're going to call this metric feeds

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,480
last scene right the last seen time that

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,240
i have

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,760
uh you know gotten new data from a

00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,760
certain from a certain data feed

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:17,039
and in order to make this data

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,559
again it's it's tracked in seconds since

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,679
the epoch so in order to make this

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,039
useful

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:27,120
again i need to do this on device

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:30,640
eid and i need to take the rate of

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:35,440
increase of this time stamp over

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:38,080
some period of time let's say 10 minutes

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,679
and ensure that that is greater than

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,679
zero

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
all right so again what is this little

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,799
bit of logic

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
doing it's making sure that i'm getting

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,960
fresh data because if i'm getting fresh

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
data

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,320
the timestamp will update and the rate

00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,280
of increase

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,960
will be greater than zero if i'm just

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,640
reading the same data over and over

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,520
again the same exposed metric over and

00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,360
over and over again

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,720
then this won't increase and the rate of

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,159
increase will be zero and then this

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
alert won't fire

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,360
i could i could choose to set up a

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,280
separate alert

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,039
showing that i'm getting stale data if i

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,559
want to

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:15,120
it's fantastic so

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,159
we want to fire this alert only if new

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,520
data comes in again

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,000
to reaffirm that the frozen suction line

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,679
condition is actually still frozen

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
otherwise we can get the single cold

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,679
point and the stalemetric could carry it

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,880
forward for 10 minutes

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,840
fire or false a lot wonderful now we

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,480
have a

00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,480
actually pretty nice reliable alerting

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,799
rule here

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,080
and what happens if we add another let's

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,960
say 100 boards

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,679
onto package units all over the place

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
right

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,880
so the beauty here is that i don't have

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,039
to do anything

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,400
we don't have to update this rule at all

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,679
it's really cool i don't have to touch

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,880
my config file i don't even have to

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,600
reload prometheus

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,039
we get this all for free that's very

00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,159
powerful

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:02,559
and it's very scalable

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,679
so this is a like this is a ton of

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,640
functionality

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,400
all in a very small lightweight package

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
it's pretty easy to administer

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,559
um you know the company's grown quite a

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,520
bit since i first set all this stuff up

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,000
but telos started life as a two-person

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,640
startup i was the only engineer

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,679
and the fact that a single person could

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,760
stand up

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,120
you know all this sort of scalable

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,720
infrastructure

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,640
you know really without any without any

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,600
prior expertise and this kind of

00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,080
technology

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,159
i think that shows how you know how

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,600
lightweight it is while still being very

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,080
very scaled so

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,360
i hope this has given you i really hope

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,520
this has given you all a

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,559
taste of you know a how we run

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,440
prometheus for

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,400
iot and again i want the point of this

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
talk

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
not to be like how you do this you know

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,039
perfect how a world's expert might do

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,320
this perfectly

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,000
the point of this talk is really to show

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,640
our experience in standing up this

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,559
system

00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,840
again with no prior expertise in the

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,480
technology

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,279
so i have no doubt that you know kind of

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,039
the prom ql wizards in the audience

00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,720
you all have probably come up with you

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:11,520
know 10 different and better ways

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,039
that we could have designed this data um

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,520
you might be getting real agitated by

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,600
now

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,360
and if this is you um please you know i

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,400
welcome your your suggestions

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,600
in in this matter um and even if that

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,240
doesn't describe you

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,760
i'll invite any questions that you have

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,240
