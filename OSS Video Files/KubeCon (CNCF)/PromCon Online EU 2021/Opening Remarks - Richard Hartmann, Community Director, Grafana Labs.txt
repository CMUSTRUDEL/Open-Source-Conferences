welcome welcome welcome um to yet

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,120
another unfortunately virtual edition

00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,120
of promcom

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,480
hopefully maybe next year will be

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,960
different

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,039
um so let me see oh you can have it

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,800
perfect

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,720
so um there's a little bit of

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,880
housekeeping but there's a little bit

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,880
there's a lot of of mental keeping

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:32,960
not not to start on a bad note

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,880
actually i want to end the initial intro

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,559
on an uplifting note

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,680
yet um i do think that we need to

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,000
acknowledge that

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,039
that the last few months were complete

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,840
and other whole and it's just

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,760
not good um if you're one of the few who

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
are vaccinated you're highly privileged

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
myself i don't even know when i get the

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,559
shot but

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,879
even that means i'm pretty rich because

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,440
i live in germany and i'm pretty much

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,399
before

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,559
most others um the kovacs scheme will

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,479
run into 2023

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
uh that's the current planning so just

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,680
to give you a rough indication of how

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,600
long others

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,799
will get to wait for something where

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,560
they have no chance of of bypassing

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,960
it's horrible which means

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,960
uh please reach out to your friends

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,720
family co-workers especially if they're

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,400
in regions which are not yet

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,479
vaccinated especially if they're in

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
hearted regions like india or brazil or

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,880
so

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,799
um because it's super easy to forget in

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
in the daily life once your own life

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,119
starts reopening

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,640
um that others are way worse off and

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,960
even if they're vaccinated even if

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,720
they're

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,159
in in the country which which already

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,040
has all all the vaccines and everything

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,439
it's still quite likely that they took a

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,000
hit

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,840
from this time so yes please reach reach

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,920
out to them

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
switching to things which feel somewhat

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,520
mundane um

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,040
we do have a code of conduct we follow

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,079
this and we follow it

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
quite seriously and aggressively um also

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,280
if you

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,200
if you well it's not so much a concern

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,479
here but if if your question becomes

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,160
more of a statement it will be shut down

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,480
in case anything goes bad on this

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,560
platform

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,440
there is a document which will be used

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,239
for as a as a kind of watering hole

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,599
in case anything breaks so i also

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,760
tweeted this a few

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,360
minutes ago um so you have that link i

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,400
will also share it in chat and such

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,720
um so it's just making its rounds

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,840
um yeah and that's more or less it so

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
let's walk through what we'll have today

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
um

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
i can actually reshare

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,040
or maybe i can't

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
i can

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,200
genius so

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,360
um right after um

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,120
this this initial session uh we will

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,920
have someone who will talk about

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,480
that's me um i'll talk about how to make

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,200
prometheus as as a wider ecosystem more

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,519
open

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,440
there is a several bits and pieces which

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
should be super interesting there's also

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,040
a

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,319
pretty big press announcement today

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,080
so yeah stay tuned for that um

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,080
julius we'll be talking about kind of

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
compatibility testing

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,159
um because more as more and more people

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,840
um or vendors and projects get into into

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,480
the prometheus ecosystem it becomes more

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,680
and more

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,000
important that we as as the

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,440
upstream project actually asserting that

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,560
users get the same experience and

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,840
features and everything

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,959
throughout the complete ecosystem

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,799
uh peter we'll be talking how how we

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,920
how we add grafana that's um

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,840
migrated cortex to the uh to basically

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,319
what is the thanos storage backend which

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,239
was a huge undertaking on our end and it

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,840
was

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,879
quite good and kudos to the thanos

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,519
people then we have bartik

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,319
and annas who will be talking about

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
automating

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,000
and how all of this can be done with

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
prometheus in the background then we

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,720
have something new

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,440
which is a sponsored keynote um

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,799
that will be led by redhead but we

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,199
looked at the topic so

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,800
this isn't this this will not be a pitch

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,520
it's just a technical session which is

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,720
coming through

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,880
through um this mechanism

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
then observability for air conditioners

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,520
as someone who is

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,000
uh who built a data center right before

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,000
doing this

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,000
oh sorry i just got poked in the

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,759
background um

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,759
so that's a different that's a different

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
uh aspect of how to do

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,880
of how to do hvac and industrial control

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,840
systems through

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,240
um through the premises ecosystem but

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,800
also

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,360
super interesting one and then we have

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,240
tom

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
who will also be talking about uh all

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
the

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,320
compatibility and and conform the

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,360
compliance things

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,600
uh this time from the premier's remote

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,880
right angle um where we recently

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,160
published a specification so we now have

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,880
a real uh hard

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,160
stable version of prometheus remote

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,360
right not this

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,560
experimental for years which will also a

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,039
allows

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,120
this conformance testing and b it will

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,880
allow us to um to actually start

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,400
iterating on top of what we currently

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,240
have of course we're nailing down what

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,039
we have without taking

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,039
the experimental guarantees away

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
then we have matthias who will be

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,560
talking about controv

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,840
and how to leverage prometheus for the

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
permissions tsdb

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,639
for con prof in case you don't know

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,680
that's continuous profiling

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,000
that is another super interesting topic

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
then we have bjern who will be talking

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
about

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,000
new histograms as most of you will know

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,160
we have hard boundaries or buckets

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,160
for four histograms histograms they're

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,840
relatively low resolution which has

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
super nice properties in widely

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,919
distributed fleets

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,000
but it's also not super nice if you want

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,960
to drill down into a specific

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,600
subsample or into a specific tiny bucket

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,720
or

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,720
tiny for some value of but tom byron

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,319
will be talking about all of this

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
there's also super interesting design

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,039
document out i hope he'll link to it

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,039
else we can do it in the chat

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,000
then we have oh i didn't

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,280
i didn't i didn't practice that name

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,639
shreyas i hope and gibbs who will be

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,560
talking about

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,199
how to use aiml

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,680
to to actually predict what would be

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,880
good

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,039
um recording rules for

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,880
for your prometheus system and then at

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,000
the end we have uh dave oh not at the

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,160
end we have david

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,199
talk about how to do meta monitoring

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,599
which is

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,520
who guards the guardians another super

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,280
interesting thing

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,120
now we have another sponsored keynote

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,840
but again it will not be a

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,120
a stupid sales pitch expect technical

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,039
content

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,960
and then we have the great tradition of

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,199
lightning talks um

00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,560
let me check yeah i can i mean you can

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,840
read it yourself you probably already

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,880
read it yourself

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,360
um we will uh we

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,280
crammed as many as many lightning talks

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
into into the thing as we could as per

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
usual unfortunately this time is not

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
worth writing in but that will soon

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,520
resume

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
then you'll see this sack of potatoes

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,240
again

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,520
and at the end we have a birds of a

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,199
weather session

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,280
where we can just have an open

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,440
discussion uh about

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,919
everything prometheus and non-prometheus

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,240
and in particular how if you have

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
a not exactly green field deployment and

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,120
you have

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:56,319
lots of old stuff as well how to

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,800
integrate all of this

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,280
and and how to take the pain off of not

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,080
having promises in all the places away

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,639
and i mean honestly in any non-tiny

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,960
company you

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
always have at least two systems for for

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,319
most things um so

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:15,199
this is just reality so

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
one minute 32 too early i think i'll

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,360
just head over

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:27,039
back to the to the waiting room

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:29,919
unless i get any last minute pointers

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,919
i see typing

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,399
ah you need to register for ford above

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,519
okay that's a good point i don't know if

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,120
that's actually possible

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,279
but we like i don't know if it's

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,920
possible yet or at the moment

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,399
uh we can also figure this out through

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
chat

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,040
while while we have this session

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,959
so yeah uh 40 seconds to go so i'll just

00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,040
stop babbling

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,040
