The Future is Bright, the Future is Prometheus Remote Write - Tom Wilkie, Grafana Labs

"Prometheus remote write was introduced almost 5 years ago as a way for Prometheus to send samples to external storage. Since then the protocol has been implemented by ~30 different metrics systems - and in version 2.25, Prometheus itself accepts remote write!

In this talk we'll discuss the use cases for pushing data to Prometheus via remote write - and more importantly, what it's not meant for. We'll present a more thorough specification of the protocol, and some of the future plans and what a remote write v2 might look like - streaming? metadata? exemplars?"
