A New Kid in Histogram Town - Björn Rabenstein, Code Fresh & RedHat

“Bedecke deinen Himmel, Zeus! A new kid is in town.”

That was the beginning of Prometheus's README.md in the olden days of your favorite monitoring system. Prometheus changed how the world was doing monitoring. Now it is time to change how Prometheus is doing histograms.

After a lot of research and even more delays, we finally have a design doc with the momentous title “Sparse high-resolution histograms for Prometheus”. Guided by this document, we are currently working on making better histograms for Prometheus a reality. This talk will tell you about what already works and what the next steps will be."
