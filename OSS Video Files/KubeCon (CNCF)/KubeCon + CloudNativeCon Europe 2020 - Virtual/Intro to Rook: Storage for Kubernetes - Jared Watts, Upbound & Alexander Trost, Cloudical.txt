Intro to Rook: Storage for Kubernetes - Jared Watts, Upbound & Alexander Trost, Cloudical 

In this talk, the Rook project will be introduced to attendees of all levels and experience. Rook is an open source cloud-native storage orchestrator for Kubernetes, providing the platform, framework, and support for a diverse set of storage solutions to natively integrate with cloud-native environments. Rook turns storage software into self-managing, self-scaling, and self-healing storage services. It does this by automating deployment, bootstrapping, configuration, provisioning, scaling, upgrading, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring, and resource management. The benefits and use cases of Rook will be explored along with an overview of each of the Rook storage providers: Ceph, EdgeFS, YugabyteDB, Cassandra, NFS, and CockroachDB. Rook was accepted as the first storage project hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in January 2018.
