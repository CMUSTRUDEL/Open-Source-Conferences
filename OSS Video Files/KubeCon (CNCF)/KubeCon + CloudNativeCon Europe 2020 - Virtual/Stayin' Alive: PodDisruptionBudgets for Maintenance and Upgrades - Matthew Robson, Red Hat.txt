Stayin' Alive: PodDisruptionBudgets for Maintenance and Upgrades - Matthew Robson, Red Hat 

As we work harder to automate our clusters, it becomes more and more difficult to guarantee the availability requirements of our applications. In large clusters, operations teams may not have the insights to ensure an applications minimum capacity requirements are maintained. Without that understanding, you may inadvertently bring down or inhibit applications through routine maintenance activities.  Enter the Pod Disruption Budget (PDB). Simply put, PDBs allows application owners to define the minimum requirement for a service to operate in a stable manner.  In this Lightning Talk, let me walk you through the benefits, usage and implementation of PDB’s. As an attendee, you will walk away with the necessary knowledge on how to use PDBs to define enforceable operating requirements of your applications.
