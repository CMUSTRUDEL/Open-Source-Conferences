CloudEvents - v1.0 and Beyond - Discovery/Subscriptions - Doug Davis, IBM & Clemens Vasters, Microsoft 

With the release of CloudEvents v1.0 the project has now expanded its scope to consider other potential pain points for the community. To that end, the group is focusing on Event Discovery and Subscriptions APIs in the hopes of reducing the friction of discovering which events are available from Event Producers as well as how someone can subscribe to those receive those events. In this session we'll quickly summarize, and review, the status of CloudEvents and then jump into the goals, design and status of the new Discovery and Subscription APIs specification being developed.
