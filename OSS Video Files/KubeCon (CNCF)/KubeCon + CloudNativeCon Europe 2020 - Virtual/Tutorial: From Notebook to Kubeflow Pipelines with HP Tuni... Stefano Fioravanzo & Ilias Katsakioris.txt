Tutorial: From Notebook to Kubeflow Pipelines with HP Tuning: A Data Science Journey - Stefano Fioravanzo & Ilias Katsakioris, Arrikto 

An introduction to Kubeflow, the ML toolkit for K8s and the workflows you can use as a data scientist to scale up your ML code effortlessly.  Ever thought how hard it is to convert your Jupyter Notebooks into deployable and composable pipelines, scale up computation and run hyperparameter tuning? With Kubeflow, this process becomes extremely easy as you make use of the many components of this ML toolkit: Pipelines, Kale, Katib, Snapshot Store.  You will learn how to deploy Kubeflow in minutes, explore your ML code inside a Jupyter Notebook, convert it to a composable and scalable workflow with the click of a button, make the pipeline reproducible using immutable snapshots, go back in history and debug it, run hyperparameter tuning and distribute your computation.  Did we mention you won’t need any specific SDK or CLI command to do this? Sounds like magic? Come and see for yourself!
