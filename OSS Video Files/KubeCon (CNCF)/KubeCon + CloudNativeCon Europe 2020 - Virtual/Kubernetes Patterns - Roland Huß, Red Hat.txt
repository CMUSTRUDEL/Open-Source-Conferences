Kubernetes Patterns - Roland Huß, Red Hat 

The way developers design, build, and run software has changed significantly with the evolution of microservices, containers and Kubernetes. This talk dives into common, reusable patterns and principles for designing and implementing cloud-native applications on Kubernetes.  This talk focus on the most established patterns. It will revisit basic patterns like "Predictable Demands" or "Service Discovery" but also dive into prominent patterns "Sidecar", "Elastic Scale" or "Operator". Live demos back this presentation.  This presentation is ideal for developers and architects who want to learn more about a pattern-based approach to implementing common Kubernetes usage scenarios.
