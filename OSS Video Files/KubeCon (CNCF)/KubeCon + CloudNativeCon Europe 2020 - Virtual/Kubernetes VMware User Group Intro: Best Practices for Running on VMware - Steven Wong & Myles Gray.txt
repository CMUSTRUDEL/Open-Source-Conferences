This will be an inaugural presentation by organizers and members of the recently formed Kubernetes VMware User Group. This group addresses running all forms of Kubernetes on VMware infrastructure. Come to this session if you want to meet other users, along with those who develop, test and support running K8s on vSphere and desktop hypervisors. This group is also here to support those building/using cluster installation tooling for VMware hypervisors. Agenda: - Intro to the vSphere cloud provider and related storage plugins - Recent features/changes: What are they? How to use them? - Running Kubernetes on "desktop" hypervisors - How to get involved in the User Group
