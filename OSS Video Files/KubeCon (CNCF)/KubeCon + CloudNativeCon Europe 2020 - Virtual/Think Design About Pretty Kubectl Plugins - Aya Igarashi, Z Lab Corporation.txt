Think Design About Pretty Kubectl Plugins - Aya Igarashi, Z Lab Corporation 

What is a well-designed CLI? How do we develop it?  Kubernetes is widely spread and people start to be interested in Day2 Operation. Along with this, the number of kubectl plugins is developed recently.  In this presentation, Aya Igarashi will talk about how to improve the design and develop a kubectl plugin based on her experience. She develops kubectl-bindrole which is a kubectl plugin that summarizes permissions for an RBAC account. https://github.com/Ladicle/kubectl-bindrole  This session will be helpful for people who want to develop kubectl plugins, as well as for general CLI development.
