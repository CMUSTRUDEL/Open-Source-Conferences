Users First: Why (and How!) We Internationalized Our Cloud-Native Project - Carol Scott, Buoyant 

While there are many resources online about internationalization (i18n) in general, there are Kubernetes-specific lessons that we learned at Buoyant in the process of internationalizing Linkerd’s web dashboard that are vital for end users and CNCF project maintainers alike who are building robust, global projects.    This lightning talk will share Linkerd’s recent i18n journey, including     - Why internationalizing user-facing features affects your project's success  - What i18n has to do with accessibility (a11y)  - What we applied -- and what we didn’t! -- from the K8s community’s i18n practices  - Kubernetes-specific pitfalls when internationalizing content    Audience members will leave with an accessible, easy roadmap to go from i18n idea to execution, with minimal organizational hiccups.
