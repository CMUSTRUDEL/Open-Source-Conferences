Users First: Why (and How!) We Internationalized Our Cloud-Native Project - Carol Scott, Buoyant 

While there are many resources online about internationalization (i18n) in general, there are Kubernetes-specific lessons that we learned at Buoyant in the process of internationalizing Linkerd’s web dashboard that are vital for end users and CNCF project maintainers alike who are building robust, global projects.    This lightning talk will share Linkerd’s recent i18n journey, including     - Why internationalizing user-facing features affects your project's success  - What i18n has to do with accessibility (a11y)  - What we applied -- and what we didn’t! -- from the K8s community’s i18n practices  - Kubernetes-specific pitfalls when internationalizing content    Audience members will leave with an accessible, easy roadmap to go from i18n idea to execution, with minimal organizational hiccups.

hi everyone i'm carol and i'm a software

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,680
engineer at buoyant

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:07,120
working on the open source service mesh

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,720
project linker d

00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,720
and the application dive

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,120
when i first proposed this talk to share

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,119
lessons that buoyant had learned

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,720
in the process of internationalizing

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,119
lingerie specifically

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,880
our web dashboard the world was in a

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,800
much different place

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,400
this talk is still going to leave you

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,680
with a roadmap to follow

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,599
if you are considering

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,640
internationalizing your cloud native

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,120
project

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,520
but first let's zoom out a bit and talk

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,800
about why

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,320
internationalization of your project is

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,920
even more urgent today

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,920
than it was six months ago

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
as the entire world battles the

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,320
coronavirus pandemic

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,600
users around the globe are using cloud

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,879
native technologies

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,320
to fight covid19 this photo was taken

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,600
just a few days ago

00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,480
from texas grocery chain agb who needed

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,800
to quickly

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,120
scale their curbside and home delivery

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,320
to handle exponential demand

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,760
they did it with cloud native

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,680
technologies including linker d

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,159
cloud native technology is also being

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,720
used to help public health authorities

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,280
battle covid19 and the epidemic has also

00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,840
changed

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,000
work many of you including me are lucky

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,320
enough to be able to work remotely

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,280
my company buoyant has shifted to being

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,040
wholly remote first

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,680
with all of these people around the

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,920
world relying on cloud native tech

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,680
users are increasingly hailing from

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
different locales with different native

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
languages

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,000
this graph is from last year's cncf

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,479
survey and the trend

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,560
to continues to be more global so we

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,960
need to make our products accessible to

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,680
people from all nations and cultures

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,680
especially at such a time in our history

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,360
on a project level internationalization

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,759
is a great way to empower your

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,520
open source contributors here's an issue

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,439
that one of our community members

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,040
filed earlier this year in the linkerity

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,439
website repo

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,360
frequently translating the docs is a

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
great way to learn about an open source

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,319
project

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,640
and to introduce new contributors to

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,239
your code base

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,400
so first some terminology

00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:20,400
internationalization

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,440
is the process of architecting your

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,160
application

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,319
so it can be quickly and easily adapted

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,120
to various languages and regions around

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,120
the world

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,599
it is sometimes called globalization

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,640
when we use the word

00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:35,519
internationalization we are typically

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,879
referring to the

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,080
overall process and design portion

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,879
of making your app inclusive

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,200
the term localization typically refers

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,360
to the more specific translations

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,959
words numbers and formatting that you

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,080
would include for each

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,720
language or locale

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,040
as cloud native projects the complexity

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,159
of translating kubernetes concepts and

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,800
vocabulary

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,000
may seem very overwhelming but i have

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,920
great news for you

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
the kubernetes documentation has done

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,800
most of the work already

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,879
you don't have to start with a blank

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
slate there are many languages that are

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,360
already represented in the kubernetes

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,040
docs

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,040
with a thriving community of translators

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,879
at linkerd since we first wanted to

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,519
start our internationalization journey

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,280
with the web

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,200
dashboard we took advantage of the

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,519
kubernetes dashboard repo

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,360
first to investigate how such a huge

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,080
project with so many contributors

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,159
added kubernetes specific translations

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,799
and then for the translations

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,599
themselves much of the vocabulary was

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,080
shared across the dashboards

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,440
less formally the kubernetes slack is a

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,920
great place to look

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,159
there is a constant hum of translators

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,000
discussions and prs being made

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,000
as the vocabulary of kubernetes

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
continues to change and evolve

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,439
you can look for channels that start

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,760
with kubernetes hyphen docs

00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,439
and pop in and out to see conversations

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,280
that updates almost every single day

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,720
with the help of the resources from the

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,400
kubernetes community

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,480
we now have a scaffolding for an

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,280
internationalized web dashboard for

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,159
linker d

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,400
prs and feedback welcome our goal is to

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,040
have a more inclusive kubernetes

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,919
service mesh experience as our growing

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,320
user base

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,040
uses our technology to build innovative

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,720
reliable

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,880

your embarking on it for your own cloud

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,360

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,440
we'd love to connect with you thank you
