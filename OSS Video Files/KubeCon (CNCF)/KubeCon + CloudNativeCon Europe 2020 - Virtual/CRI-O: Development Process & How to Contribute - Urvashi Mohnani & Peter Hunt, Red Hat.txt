CRI-O: Development Process & How to Contribute - Urvashi Mohnani & Peter Hunt, Red Hat 

Are you interested in contributing to Cloud Native projects, or open source, but are unsure on where to start? The CRI-O community strives to be welcoming and accessible for new contributors, and would love your help! Urvashi Mohnani and Peter Hunt will dive into the basic workflow behind open source development, using CRI-O as an example. They will walk attendees through the entire process of contribution, including: finding a bug or feature to work on, submitting a PR, cooperating with the needs of CI/CD systems, the approval process, and having their work integrated downstream. After seeing this talk, budding community members should be ready to submit their first contribution to CRI-O.
