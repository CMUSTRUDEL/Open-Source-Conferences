Be a Good Corporate Citizen in Kubernetes - Dawn Foster, VMware 

As an employee, it can be difficult to strike the right balance between the needs of the company and the needs of the open source Kubernetes project. This can create friction and put significant pressure on employees who participate in Kubernetes on behalf of their company when the needs of the individual, the company, and the community are not aligned. This talk will focus on ways to create this alignment between individuals, companies, and the community required to be successful participants in Kubernetes.  The talk contains three major sections: * How collaboration happens within the Kubernetes project. * How to build a strategy for participation that will benefit your company, your employees, and the Kubernetes community. * Tips for being a good corporate citizen as you contribute to Kubernetes.
