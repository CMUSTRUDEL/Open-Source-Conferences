Be a Good Corporate Citizen in Kubernetes - Dawn Foster, VMware 

As an employee, it can be difficult to strike the right balance between the needs of the company and the needs of the open source Kubernetes project. This can create friction and put significant pressure on employees who participate in Kubernetes on behalf of their company when the needs of the individual, the company, and the community are not aligned. This talk will focus on ways to create this alignment between individuals, companies, and the community required to be successful participants in Kubernetes.  The talk contains three major sections: * How collaboration happens within the Kubernetes project. * How to build a strategy for participation that will benefit your company, your employees, and the Kubernetes community. * Tips for being a good corporate citizen as you contribute to Kubernetes.

welcome to my talk about being a good

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,440
corporate citizen

00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,800
in kubernetes first i'll tell you a bit

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,080
about me

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,679
i've spent more than 20 years working in

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
the technology industry

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,520
and most of that time i've been working

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,039
on open source projects

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,279
from within a variety of different

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,880
companies i've been the director of

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,279
community at puppet

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,119
and community lead for intel's open

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,519
source technology center

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,800
i also have a phd from the university of

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,360
greenwich in london

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,079
that i got by researching how people

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,840
working at

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,000
many different companies collaborate

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,920
within the linux kernel

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,840
before the vmware acquisition of pivotal

00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,399
i was also responsible for

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,079
driving pivotal's kubernetes

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
contribution strategy

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,360
and i was actively contributing to

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,760
kubernetes within the contributor

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,680
experience sig

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,960
i'm now working in vmware's open source

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,440
program office

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,399
and i'm responsible for our open source

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,160
community

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,119
strategy so lately i've been more active

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,479
in the cncf contributor contributor

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,080
strategy sig

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,040
in particular the governance working

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,479
group i'm also a board member of open uk

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,360
which is focused on developing and

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,920
sustaining leadership in open technology

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,520
here in the uk i'm a governing board

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,600
member and maintainer for the linux

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
foundation's chaos project

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,960
which is focused on using metrics to

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,840
evaluate the health of open source

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,520
projects i'm also on the advisory board

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,320
for petergia which is a company that

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,360
builds

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,040
open source health metrics dashboards

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,880
my work in open source software has

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,280
focused on both growing

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,720
participation in company driven open

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,720
source projects

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,600
and in helping our employees collaborate

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,960
within large foundation driven projects

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,640
like the work that i've been doing

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,320
within kubernetes and other

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,320
cncf and ecosystem projects

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,240
let's start by talking about how

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,799
collaboration works within kubernetes

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,920
and these

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,880
complex interactions between individuals

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,880
employers and the communities while i'm

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
talking specifically about kubernetes

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,560
in this talk much of this also applies

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,560
to other open source projects

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
your contributions to kubernetes are

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,120
centered around you

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,920
as an individual contributions come from

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
individuals

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,360
rather than companies when someone

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,239
submits a pull request

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
to fix a bug add a feature or update

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,200
some

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,440
documentation within kubernetes the

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,760
change comes from an individual

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,959
commits usually include a name and an

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,599
email address

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
but in many cases unless someone uses

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,920
their corporate email address you can't

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,879
even tell

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,360
where a person works as individuals

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,920
there are plenty of opportunities

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,360
to move into positions of leadership

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,959
within the community

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,440
and these are all documented in more

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,720
detail as links off of the community

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,800
page on github

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,400
but i wanted to provide a short overview

00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
to help people understand

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,560
the community structure within

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,280
kubernetes the starting point is here at

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,519
the bottom

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,640
as an org member after you've made a few

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,400
contributions

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,959
and this allows people to assign you to

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,920
issues and other activities in github

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,800
after you have a history of making solid

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,319
contributions

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,040
and reviewing other people's

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,280
contributions you can made a reviewer

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,120
and eventually an approver these roles

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,640
are documented in owner's files

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,400
which indicate the parts of the

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,400
repository where you have those

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
responsibilities

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,159
most of the work within kubernetes

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,040
happens across the dozens of special

00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,799
interest groups

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,720
and working groups which i'll talk about

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,760
later and each of these can have

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,239
multiple sub-projects and each of the

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,480
sub-projects also has leads assigned

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,239
and at the very top is the kubernetes

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,159
steering committee

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,840
which is an elected governing body with

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,040
oversight over the entire

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
project to make all of this more

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
interesting

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
for employers the leadership positions

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,080
within kubernetes

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,519
stay with the individual if that person

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,599
moves to a new company

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,200
and let's face it kubernetes skills are

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,519
in high demand

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,120
so you see quite a bit of movement

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,959
between employers

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,720
for example within the past year or so

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,120
we've seen a couple of people

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,120
on the steering committee and many other

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880
leads change employers

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,479
since an employee can take their

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,919
leadership position in our project to

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,680
the next job

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,120
companies are well served to make sure

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,160
that they keep these

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,240
contributors happy

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,720
in the kubernetes project as i mentioned

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,160
there is no direct way for companies to

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,720
participate

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,800
other than dedicating time from

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
individual employees who contribute on

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
behalf of the company

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,160
which is becoming increasingly common

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,440
across many different kinds of open

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,000
source projects

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,479
i work at vmware and we have loads of

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,720
people

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,080
working full-time on kubernetes

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,600
similarly companies like

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,600
red hat google microsoft intel

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
and loads of others employ people to

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,400
work on kubernetes

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,000
as their day job if you don't already

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
have employees with the skills to

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,440
contribute to kubernetes

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,000
you might be able to hire an existing

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,840
contributor or possibly even a lead

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,160
as an employee to do the work on the

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,320
project on your behalf

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,000
in addition to devoting time from your

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,240
employees to the project

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,240
the cncf also relies on funding that

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,680
comes from member companies to fund

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
infrastructure events and other project

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,000
needs

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,600
and i'll talk more about all of this

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,919
later since corporate involvement in

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,199
kubernetes is indeed the main focus for

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,400
this particular presentation

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,280
the kubernetes community is made up of

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,320
a wide variety of individuals who are

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,960
working together

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,840
to make kubernetes awesome when i talk

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,919
about community

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,880
i'm including all of the people who work

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,039
on the project

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,160
this includes developers release

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,120
management

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,520
testing localization and anyone else who

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,919
contributes to the project

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,560
application developers who are using the

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,160
kubernetes apis and other features

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,479
to build things that will run on top of

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,080
kubernetes users

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:12,720
the people who run kubernetes day-to-day

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,400
in their environments and hopefully

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,680
provide some feedback to the project

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,120
along the way

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,199
people like me who are working for

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,840
vendors and companies who create their

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,680
products based on kubernetes other

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,800
contributors include people working on

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,600
promotion

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,319
organizing meetups doing documentation

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,759
and so

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,360
many other sort of thankless tasks

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
and some of these people contribute as

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
part of their day job on behalf of an

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,520
employer

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
while others contribute in their free

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,680
time and they're all

00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
important parts of the community in open

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
source communities

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,720
i've also had so many small world

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,800
moments

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,000
where people that i've worked with in

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,639
past projects

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,639
pop up again and again in other

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,720
communities that i'm a part of

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
when i first joined the contributor

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,039
experience sig meeting

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,000
i saw several people that i had known

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,160
from previous communities

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
it's important to keep in mind that you

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,039
are likely to run into

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,599
these same individuals again and again

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,479
so be thoughtful and kind when working

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,680
with others

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,680
if you're a big jerk in one community

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,840
it is likely that other people will

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,479
remember this and bring your reputation

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,639
with them into new projects which can

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,759
reflect badly on you

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,400
and on your company as an employer it's

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,120
worth

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,319
doing a bit of due diligence to see how

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,280
someone has behaved in

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,039
other open source communities before you

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,800
have them contribute to kubernetes

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,280
on your behalf this individual

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,199
employer and community triad creates

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
unique challenges

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,639
as an individual contributing to

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,599
kubernetes or any other

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,879
open source project there will be times

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,840
when you will need to find

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,280
ways to create balance between what your

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,199
employer wants you to do

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,800
and doing the right thing for the

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,120
kubernetes community

00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,800
which can create really awkward and

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,440
uncomfortable conversations with your

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,360
managers sometimes

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,639
the worst case scenario is when there

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,520
are direct

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
conflicts and what your employer wants

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,240
you to do

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,319
would go against the best interest of

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,919
the kubernetes community

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,479
at times like these you'll need to be

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:26,560
diplomatic it can help to ask some

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,039
questions to understand

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,199
what your company needs to accomplish

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,959
and see if you can find another creative

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,760
way to meet this need in a way that

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,919
aligns with the needs of the community

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
sometimes this won't be possible and

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,640
you'll need to go back to your company

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,320
and explain why what they want just

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,480
isn't going to happen

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
which is one of those really awkward and

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,000
uncomfortable discussions

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,000
as an employer you can make this easier

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,640
on your contributors by taking the

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,640
time to understand the types of

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,360
kubernetes contributions

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,560
that will be welcomed by the community

00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,040
it's important to have

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,440
regular conversations with your

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
contributors to understand what the

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,120
project needs

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,320
and to learn how you can work within the

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,680
community

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
you can help your employees be

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,320
successful by being careful

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,760
not to push your employees to do things

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,279
that aren't in the best interest of the

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,519
community

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,000
personally i've been in a couple of

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
situations where i've left companies

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,600
because of this conflict and other open

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,760
source projects

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,519
and i know lots of really amazing people

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,440
who've done the same thing

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,640
kubernetes contributors are in high

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
demand so

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,800
helping your employees avoid these

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,560
conflicts in the first place

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,560
will help you retain this great talent

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,880
now that we have a better idea of how

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,040
collaboration works in kubernetes

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,959
next up we'll talk about how to build a

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,160
kubernetes contribution strategy

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,160
and plan for your company

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,160
before the vmware acquisition of pivotal

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,600
i was responsible for creating

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,480
our kubernetes contribution strategy one

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,240
key to having a successful strategy for

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,320
your open source contributions

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,040
is to align them with the overall

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,680
business goals for your entire company

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,640
if your open source contributions don't

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,279
support the

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,440
overall strategies for your organization

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,959
you will drastically reduce the chance

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,680
of being successful

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
by taking some time and effort to make

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,519
sure you support

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,839
your overall corporate strategy then it

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,839
will be much easier to justify

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,560
continuing these efforts during the next

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,160
planning cycle for your organization

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,680
this is why i started by looking at

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,800
pivotal's corporate and product

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,480
strategies

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,560
when writing kubernetes contribution

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,760
strategies i made sure

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,480
that i could show our show how our work

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,000
on kubernetes supported our overall

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,839
goals as a company

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,040
this can really help make the case to

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,360
senior management

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,959
and company executives who are not

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,560
likely to be involved in the low-level

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,160
details of the project

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,920
explaining how your kubernetes

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,720
contributions support the goals of the

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
company

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,160
can help the exact team understand the

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,880
importance of this work

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,079
on the other hand when your goals are

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,079
not clearly aligned

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,600
with the overall strategy people will

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,440
look at your participation in the

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,079
kubernetes community as something that

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,279
could

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,000
can just be cut or starved of resources

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,399
with open source projects it is so easy

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,800
to fall into the trap of describing

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,440
your contributions as something that can

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,519
sound an

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,560
awful lot like charity to an executive

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,640
there is a strong open source ethos

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,560
of contributing to the common good of

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,959
the project

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,959
or what people often refer to as chop

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,760
wood and carry water tasks

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,720
and these are really important we all

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,600
need to pitch in

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,040
and help in a variety of areas but even

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,120
many of these tasks

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
can be described in ways that help your

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,360
executives see

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,600
why these tasks are also important it's

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,279
also a good idea to encourage employees

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,959
to work on these activities when they're

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,839
blocked on other tasks like maybe

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,560
waiting for pull request reviews

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,480
some employees might see contributing to

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,360
kubernetes to be its own reward

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
having a solid strategy can also help

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,519
employees understand

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,200
how their work contributes to the

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,519
success of the company

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,279
as an employee it's really nice to see

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,880
that your work has an impact

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,200
in helping the company achieve their

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
goals

00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,320
most of the work within kubernetes

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,639
happens within the

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,600
dozens of special interest groups

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,600
working groups

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,959
and other committees and as you can see

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,320
in the slide there are a

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,040
lot of them it can be overwhelming

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,920
at first and it's unlikely that you will

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,839
be able to have

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,240
employees contribute to all of these

00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,480
areas so you want to focus

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,360
on a few areas that are the most

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,680
important

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,360
for you based on what you're trying to

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,000
achieve as a company

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,560
determining where you need to contribute

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,560
within these areas is likely to be the

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,839
focus of your kubernetes contribution

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,000
strategy

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,440
at pivotal i spent a lot of time talking

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
to product managers

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
and engineering leadership to better

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,480
understand both our current pain points

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,320
and our future product strategies so

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,839
that i could understand both our short

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
and long term needs

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
for the various kubernetes technologies

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,600
for example we had customers asking for

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,120
windows support

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
and we already had some people

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
contributing within the windows special

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,959
interest group so that was included

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,720
in the strategy as something that we

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,240
needed to continue doing to support our

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,199
current needs

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,600
we also had some efforts underway to

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,480
start

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,519
shifting our applications to run on top

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,440
of kubernetes

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,560
so that over the longer term we could

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,120
just run everything

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,320
on kubernetes to support this longer

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,120
term strategy

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,480
we had people start working within sig

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,480
api machinery

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,079
since most of our product teams would

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,800
eventually need to use

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,600
the kubernetes apis and these are just a

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,519
couple of

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
couple of examples of where we decided

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,000
to focus but ultimately you

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,839
need to figure out the best places for

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
your employees to contribute

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,040
if you aren't sure where to start

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,760
contributor experience

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,399
docs and release are all great things

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
that are both

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,639
friendly to newcomers and they help

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,440
provide more insight into the overall

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:31,360
project as you learn more about how

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,680
kubernetes really works

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,519
since companies contribute to kubernetes

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,199
by having employees participate

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,199
and collaborate you'll need to figure

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,120
out how many people you need

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,360
and what skills are required for those

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,399
people in some cases you might

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,240
have employees with the skills you need

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,240
but this goes beyond just knowing the

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,839
right technologies or having particular

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,160
specialized skills

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,360
contributing to any open source project

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,360
like kubernetes

00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,760
requires some different skills than

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,079
participating in internal projects

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,240
these people need to be comfortable in

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,720
really ambiguous environments

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,360
where they will receive feedback

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,199
possibly difficult or negative feedback

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,959
and they'll be expected to respond to

00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:15,199
this feedback in the public

00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,360
in a professional manner likewise

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,920
they'll also be providing feedback

00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,839
to other community members and keep in

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,160
mind that not every engineer

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,199
wants their work to be in the public

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,720
spotlight

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:29,600
which can feel like being under a

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,680
microscope sometimes

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,519
if you don't have the skills internally

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,199
you might be able to find existing

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,160
kubernetes contributors that you can

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,440
hire

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,279
but you need to be just a little bit

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
careful about this option too because

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,399
you don't want to get a reputation

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
for aggressively poaching employees from

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,600
other companies

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
it requires a bit of nuance to make it

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,519
known that you're interested

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,040
in hiring people to work on kubernetes

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:57,040
without aggressively

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,040
hiring them away from other employers

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,519
now that you've figured out what you

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,519
want to do let's talk about

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,800
how to do it while being a good

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,880
corporate citizen

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,839
and avoid some common but embarrassing

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,839
mistakes

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,320
the first step is to join a sig or

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,240
working group

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,440
now each singer working group is a

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,120
little bit different

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,560
but this usually means joining one or

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,880
more mailing lists and slack channels

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,680
it's a good idea to always join the main

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,759
mailing list

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,759
for your sega working group so that you

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,519
get project meeting invites and other

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,440
important information

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,680
then you should also join any relevant

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,680
sub project mailing lists or slash

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,560
channels that you're interested in

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,320
if your time zone permits attending the

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,600
sig working group and subproject

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,000
meetings is a really great way to learn

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,519
more about the current work but the

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,240
meetings are recorded so you can watch

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,959
them later

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,079
if you aren't able to attend the monthly

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,320
community meeting

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,240
is another good meeting to attend or

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,959
watch later to get an overview of what's

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,199
happening across the entire project

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,720
you'll also want to have a close look at

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,919
project documentation

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
especially the contribution docs spend

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
whatever

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,319
time it takes to fully understand the

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,799
contribution guidelines

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,160
code of conduct and other expectations

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,319
for collaboration

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,319
the expectations for contributors are

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,919
different for each project

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,760
so don't assume that you know how to

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,679
contribute to kubernetes

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,839
even if you have experience with other

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,600
open source projects

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,120
also note that most sigs and working

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,000
groups have their own contribution

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,000
guidelines

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
they cover anything specific to their

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,039
area so you want to have a look at those

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,960
too

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,840
the good news is that kubernetes has a

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,600
ton of really amazing documentation

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,679
and virtual workshops for new

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,520
contributors so it should be

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,039
fairly easy to understand how to get

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,720
started

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:54,480
i also recommend taking the time to lurk

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,960
in your sig or working group to

00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:00,640
understand how people participate

00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,960
i have seen too many over-eager

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,000
new community members in various open

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,840
source communities

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
who jump into the community with both

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,080
feet they make mistakes

00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,919
by violating community norms talking

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,440
about things that aren't relevant

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,679
and just generally kind of making a mess

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
of things everybody makes mistakes at

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,400
some point

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,480
but some of them can be avoided by

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,360
taking the time to learn about the

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,200
community

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,440
rather than barging in and trying to be

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,440
an active participant on day one

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
don't be afraid to sit back while you

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,320
learn from other community members

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,280
by taking the time to observe and lurk

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,000
for a bit

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,080
you can learn about how people behave

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,520
and get a feel for how people typically

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,960
respond

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,720
when you've spent some time

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,640
understanding the expectations

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,840
and how to contribute you should start

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,559
with something small

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,720
like bug fixes to learn about the

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:53,120
contribution process

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,440
a good place to start is by looking at

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,919
the issues for your sig or working group

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
and finding ones that are tagged good

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,200
first issue

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,360
and after gaining some experience doing

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,600
a couple of the good first issue

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,039
issues you can move on to an issue that

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,799
you find interesting

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,039
or you can look for issues tagged as

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,960
help wanted which are issues that often

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,640
require a bit more experience than good

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,000
first issues but are also

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
great places to get involved

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,919
once you start participating you should

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,080
expect feedback

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,840
in some cases you might need to have

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,080
hard discussions with people

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,320
about the merits of your contribution

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,919
but you can focus on the problem

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,440
deliver your feedback with a bit of

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,640
kindness

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,440
and also avoid any attacks on the other

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,919
person

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,480
for tough conversations it can also help

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:45,120
to have someone else read your response

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
before you post it publicly to help

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,640
catch any issues with

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,880
tone that might make you sound more

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,960
harsh than you think you do

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,919
this is an incredibly difficult line to

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,880
walk sometimes

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,480
but staying professional and being kind

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
to other people when responding to

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,440
difficult feedback

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,679
can make a big difference to your

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,039
personal reputation and the reputation

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,400
of your employer

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:10,000
within the kubernetes community in many

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,480
cases especially when you're new to

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,799
kubernetes you should expect to iterate

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,640
on the feedback after you submit your

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,440
changes to accommodate the first wave of

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,360
feedback

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,120
you're likely to get more feedback on

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,720
the changes you just made

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,600
so just consider it an iterative process

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,280
this also means that you should plan for

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,200
the time it takes

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,400
to get multiple ways of feedback

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,280
submitting something

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,600
at the last minute before a release

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,919
window closes and we do a code freeze

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,200
and then expecting it to be included is

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,480
just going to be frustrating for

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,480
everyone involved

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:49,679
so give yourself plenty of time for

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,320
multiple feedback and resubmit processes

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,200
after you get past those first few small

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,960
contributions

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,520
you'll want to make sure that you spend

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,559
time discussing proposed changes

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,240
in your sig or working group before you

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,480
start making them

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,919
these discussions usually happen in sig

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,799
or working group meetings

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,720
or in github issues by talking about

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,080
these contributions very early in the

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,679
process

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,919
you can make sure that they will be

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
consistent with the expectations of the

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,159
project

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,679
you can also learn about anyone else who

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,840
might be working in similar

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,520
areas to hopefully avoid conflicting

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,000
changes that won't work together

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,720
once they're merged these discussions

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,960
also

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,919
avoid surprising people especially for

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,840
new features or other really big changes

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,679
it can also help to break big changes

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,799
into smaller easier to digest

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,360
contributions

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,840
it's a lot easier for maintainers to

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,919
find

00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,520
time to provide feedback on smaller

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,039
contributions

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,799
and it gives you time to make

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,480
corrections if anything you're doing

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,080
maybe isn't quite right

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,320
this allows you to iterate on the

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,720
feedback through several contributions

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,919
making it less likely to have bigger

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,400
fundamental issues with your

00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,000
contribution

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,159
it's also important to keep in mind that

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,799
you don't really have any control

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,600
over other participants in the project

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,240
this is

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,960
different from working within a company

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,919
where you can

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,880
escalate any issues to managers who can

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,080
work to resolve

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,679
problems non-responsive employees in

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,559
kubernetes and other open source

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,600
projects you

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:25,600
don't have a strict chain of command or

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,440
other ways to exert control over the

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:30,240
people you collaborate with

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,360
instead you should strive to be kind and

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,919
easy to work with

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,840
since you may need to find other ways to

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,280
influence people to respond to your pull

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,280
requests or your patches

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,240
community members and especially leaders

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,400
within the kubernetes community

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,440
should expect to spend some time helping

00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,240
to bring up

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,840
the next wave of new contributors and as

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,159
employers we should plan to have

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,880
our contributors put some effort into

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,960
this

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,080
this could mean having employees who are

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,799
experienced

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,919
kubernetes contributors mentor junior

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,280
employees

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,360
to help them get started in the

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,200
community or it could mean

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,960
participating in the many mentoring

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,640
programs that are available within the

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,960
kubernetes community

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,159
meet our contributors is a meeting where

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,919
anyone can join

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,919
to ask questions of experienced

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,559
contributors

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,120
we also have shadow programs where a new

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,360
person

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,039
can shadow an experienced contributor

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,640
for a specific role

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,400
this was first adopted within the

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,400
release team

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,480
where each release has a leader for

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,320
every role on the release team

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,000
and each of those leaders has a couple

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,640
of shadows when the new

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,640
team is formed for the next release the

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,080
leads for each role are usually selected

00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,480
from the previous shadows

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,080
so this is a great way to move into a

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,760
leadership position

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,120
while the shadow program started within

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,000
the release team it's also been

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
expanding into

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,080
other areas of the project so you can

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,320
find these shadow opportunities

00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,880
in different areas whenever you can

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,679
you should try to find opportunities to

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,400
sponsor

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,520
new contributors now this term is a

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
little bit confusing

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,720
since a lot of people think of financial

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,559
sponsorship

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,840
but in this case it means using your

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,480
position

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,360
in the project to advocate for someone

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,760
who might not

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,799
otherwise have the same opportunities as

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,720
you do

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,400
this can be as simple as recommending

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,760
someone to help out with some part of

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,240
the project

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,240
sponsoring someone for org membership or

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,840
maybe recommending someone as a new

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,400
reviewer or approver

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,080
this is especially important for the

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,039
underrepresented folks that

00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,840
might be overlooked or might not be as

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:41,760
forthcoming

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,760
about asking for a leadership role

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:46,480
a lot of the work that we do in

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,440
kubernetes and other open source

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,679
projects

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
is based on the relationships we have

00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,360
with other people

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,679
my phd research was based on

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:57,039
collaboration in the linux kernel

00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:59,440
and as part of that research i

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:02,720
interviewed a bunch of kernel developers

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,720
in all of the interviews they talked

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,360
about the importance of their

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,200
relationships with other people

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,679
almost all of them talked about how

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,600
existing relationships made it easier to

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,440
collaborate with others

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,520
all of the people that i interviewed

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,559
mentioned in-person collaboration at

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,799
conferences

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,159
and other meetings as something that was

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,080
important

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,440
people talked about how it was sometimes

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,120
easier to work through

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,559
really difficult big issues at

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,159
conferences

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,240
it's easier to communicate with someone

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,480
online if you've met them before

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,720
and maybe shared a meal or a drink or

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,480
just had a nice conversation with them

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,559
knowing the human being on the other

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,279
side of the keyboard can make a bigger

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:45,120
difference

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,320
than you might realize now granted this

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,200
is a bit harder right now

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,159
given the current pandemic at all but

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,480
we're making do

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,840
with virtual events like this one with

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,279
video calls

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,200
if your employees are contributing to

00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,320
kubernetes then you should encourage

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,799
them to attend

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,440
kubecon and kubernetes contributor

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,000
summits

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,559
even attending virtually by having some

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,799
key employees attend those conferences

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,480
they can build deeper lasting

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,120
relationships with others that will

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,159
benefit

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:17,200
your company and your other employees

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,559
i've spent a lot of time at open source

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,799
conferences over the years

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,640
and i have really deep and lasting

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,159
connections with people that i've met at

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,400
those events

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,520
now when i need to do something new or

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,760
have a question

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,279
i usually know someone who can point me

00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,760
in the right direction

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,480
and i often make introductions for other

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,799
employees

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,080
to people outside of the company who can

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:42,000
help us learn something new

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:44,000
or maybe just solve some tricky issue

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,840
upstreaming your patches helps you

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,760
become a good corporate citizen

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,440
but it also has quite a few internal

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,279
benefits for your company

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,880
if you aren't familiar with upstreaming

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,720
this just means that when you make

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,279
patches to fix a bug or solve some

00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,880
internal need you submit those updates

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,880
back into kubernetes

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,279
rather than continuing just to maintain

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,360
them internally

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,600
when you maintain patches internally

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,880
every time we cut a kubernetes release

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,720
you need to go through the work of

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,880
reapplying your patches

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,760
and even possibly rewriting some of your

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,039
patches if

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,520
they touch bits of code that were

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,320
changed in the release the side effect

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,159
of this sometimes

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,440
difficult process is that people then

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,720
tend to put off

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,360
applying updates which can be a big

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,919
problem

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,760
if the release contains security fixes

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,399
while it takes more time up front

00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,880
you're better off taking the time to

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,360
submit these patches into kubernetes

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,960
where they can be properly maintained as

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,799
part of the project

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,000
and where other people can benefit from

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,399
them the

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,720
easier you can make it for your

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,000
employees to contribute these changes

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,600
back into kubernetes

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,440
and other open source projects the

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,600
better off you'll be

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,200
in general upstream patches is

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,360
considered the right thing to do

00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,120
in open source projects which will help

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,840
maintain your company's status

00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,840
as a good corporate citizen

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,559
the kubernetes community is probably the

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,640
friendliest and most welcoming community

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,120
that i've ever been involved in

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,720
largely because of their community

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,799
values

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,799
i'm going to wrap up this talk with a

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,760
discussion of the kubernetes community

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,840
values

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,039
because these values do a really good

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,200
job of summing up

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,720
my advice for being a good corporate

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,399
citizen in kubernetes

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,320
this slide has most of the community

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,880
values but the full list can be found

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,760
online

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,880
along with descriptions for each one in

00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,480
kubernetes

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,720
distribution is better than

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,240
centralization with a project

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,799
as massive as kubernetes this scale is

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
only

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,360
viable through high trust and high

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,159
visibility distribution of work

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,799
so authority decision making technical

00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,520
design

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,039
code ownership and documentation is

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,880
delegated to the various

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,080
special interest groups working groups

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,159
and committees

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,480
this is why i recommend that you focus

00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,880
on particular sigs and working groups

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,080
when building your strategies and have

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,320
each employee

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,399
focus their energy on at most a couple

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,720
of areas

00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:14,799
inclusive is better than exclusive

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,679
within the kubernetes community

00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,880
successful technology requires different

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,520
perspectives

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,600
and different skills which are easier to

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,039
achieve in a welcoming and respectful

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
environment

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:29,039
community membership in kubernetes is a

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,399
privilege

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,720
not a right and leadership is earned

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,679
through your contributions we show

00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,679
respect

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:38,720
for the time and effort put into a

00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,640
contribution

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,240
regardless of whether the contributor is

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,159
brand new to the community

00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,559
or whether they're a veteran of the

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,360
project your employees need to be

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,840
prepared

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,120
to engage with people in a way that's

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,679
respectful

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,600
and kind while showing appreciation for

00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,240
the hard work of other contributors

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,440
in kubernetes evolution is better than

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,760
stagnation

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,799
this not only refers to technological

00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,919
evolution

00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,200
but also includes continual improvement

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,480
servant leadership

00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,760
and mentorship it's the duty for leaders

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,799
in the community

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,399
to find sponsor and promote new

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,880
community members

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,000
leaders should expect to eventually step

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,240
aside

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,440
community members should expect to step

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,960
up

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,120
your experienced employee contributors

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,240
should expect to spend some time

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,960
mentoring

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,799
and or sponsoring newer contributors

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,960
these can be other employees

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:40,640
interns google summer of code students

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,600
or anyone else looking for a new

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,720
opportunity to participate

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,240
kubernetes values community over

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,679
product or company so it's important for

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,600
your employees

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,279
to think of the needs of the community

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,080
first for the benefit of

00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,039
all its members and users everywhere

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,320
individuals gain

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,640
status through their work in the

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,159
community and companies gain status

00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,360
through their commitments to support

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,440
this community

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,200
by providing the contributors required

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,799
for the project to operate

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,399
this goes back to when i was talking

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,159
about that balance between

00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,159
individuals companies and the community

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,200
as an employer it's in your best

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,640
interest to make it

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,559
easy for your employees to prioritize

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,120
the needs of the community

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:29,039
and not try to push your own agenda when

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,760
it isn't in the best interest of the

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,799
overall

00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:35,919
kubernetes community

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:40,799
with that i will say thank you and

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,799
