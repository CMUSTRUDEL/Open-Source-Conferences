all right karen talk to us about

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,280
attending sessions

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,519
can you go to the next slide oh yeah

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,760
yeah so okay we know at first glance the

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,799
schedule looks super overwhelming but

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,000
don't worry a good way to start is to

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
look at the schedule

00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,200
by the tracks and figure out what

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,239
general topics might interest you

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,840
so on the left side of the slide you can

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,720
see a screenshot of what the filters

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,519
look like

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,560
this can be found um sorry it is on the

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,760
right side of the side

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,680
of the slide yeah so um

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,599
that's what you want to look for um

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,720
don't forget to check out the 101 track

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,120
which i have starred

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,760
that's where this session falls all this

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,720
content

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
has been created for newcomers so you

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
know it's a good place to

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
you know get yourself oriented and then

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
also

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,199
look out for the beginner level sessions

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,199
that you can also filter for

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,400
under content experience level which is

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040
also started

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,639
um yeah and then another quick tip is to

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,160
utilize the sketch tool

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
um it's a great way to build out your

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
schedule and figure out like where you

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,440
might have some overlapping sessions and

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,880
just like figure out what your day is

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,639
going to look like

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,919
and then as for attending sessions

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,680
themselves um

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,840
the main takeaway we have for you is to

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,919
take advantage of the q a

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,080
speakers will be available for q a

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,400
during the duration of their session and

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,800
so

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
feel free to come up and share questions

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,360
you have as they come up and just

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,440
remember to follow the code of conduct

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,639
if you are interested in slides check

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,039
out the session page

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,960
on sketch speakers will be sharing their

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
slides there so you can reference it

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
after

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
and if you miss a session or want to

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,800
re-watch something

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
all the sessions will be recorded and

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:20,160
posted to youtube

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,160
usually within a few days if not sooner

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,240
it's always awesome to see everything go

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,840
up super quick online

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:30,160
in case you missed anything um so

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,000
just some advice from us from personally

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,280
attending sessions

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,840
i want to be really uh

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,479
really adamant about like don't be

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,280
afraid

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,880
of asking what an acronym stands for we

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,479
have a lot of them

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,400
in the cloud native community and they

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,080
might even overlap with some other

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,080
acronyms that you have at your

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,440
internal internally at your company that

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,039
you work at or

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,039
in the industry or niche that you're

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,000
involved in um so just

00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:00,240
be sure to like ask if you're uh if

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,479
you're not sure what it is

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,479
um

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
yeah karen you want to take this next

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,800
one yeah so um when you're asking

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,479
questions you know help people

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,000
understand the angle you're coming from

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,360
you can share things like

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,600
you know what you're trying to solve

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,759
what kind of position you're in

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
who you're trying to solve for and just

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,960
keep in mind that when you're asking

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,479
questions you might be asking questions

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,000
that others haven't yet thought of

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:28,000
that could apply to them yeah definitely

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,840
and if you normally take notes at

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
physical conferences

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,160
like i do try seeing if it's helpful in

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,280
this virtual setting too

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,199
a lot of times when we're at home or um

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,479
you know not in the office or not at the

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,319
actual event

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,400
we get a little lazy and we're like

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,919
we're gonna watch this like it's tv

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,560
um but just that doesn't always like um

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:50,479
help you

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
like take everything that you can away

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,240
from it so if

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,680
uh you do take notes try doing it in

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,880
this virtual setting and see if it helps

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,000
you

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,240
yeah um and then also like you know we

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,240
know it's a virtual conference and it's

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,240
super easy to get distracted so

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,800
we just recommend closing you know other

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,479
browser windows and other applications

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,880
if you do have any work that you have to

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,960
attend to consider scheduling some

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,840
dedicated pockets of time to address

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,840
that throughout the day

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,880
cool so next cncf projects

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,840
um yes i'll talk a little bit more about

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,199
this

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,520
throughout the conference you might hear

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,759
the term cnc of project a ton

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,960
and let's take some time to discuss what

00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,479
that means

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,160
but before that let's talk about what

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,639
cncf even is real quick

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,080
so cocf stands for cloud native

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,080
computing foundation

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,199
and the foundation's mission is to make

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,840
cloud native

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,919
computing ubiquitous and one way we do

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,879
this is by taking on the stewardship of

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,280
projects

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,319
so as an open source project develops in

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,720
the ecosystem

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,400
they may get donated to cncf as vendor

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,440
neutral ip

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,360
and um within cncs there are three

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,160
different levels of projects so

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
um as they mature and gain adoption they

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
level up they go from sandbox to

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,440
incubating to graduated

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,280
and if you're interested in learning

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,759
more about the cnc of projects

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,080
or cncf and its projects we recommend

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,879
checking out the links that we have

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,879
on the slides

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,840
well good things to check out don't be

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,440
overwhelmed uh the case studies on the

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:28,479
cncf website

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,280
are amazing the landscape gives you an

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,159
idea of

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,200
the breadth of projects that are in the

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,440
space

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,399
the technology radar will give you an

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,599
idea of how end users are thinking about

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,399
a specific verticals of technology like

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
ci cd

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,640
or security and then um what things

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,080
they're adopting and using

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,839
and uh and even recommend so something

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
new that's something new that we're

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,360
trying out definitely check that out and

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,560
just to kind of harp on the

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,200
vendor neutral ip a bit about the cncf

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,600
this is something that helps folks uh

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,560
get over the legal hurdles of donating i

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,120
mean

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,240
contributing donating or contributing a

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,560
code or

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,600
documentation to a project that isn't

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,040
owned by

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,519
and and mainly uh run by their own uh

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,519
company

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,480
so um you may also hear like the term

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,080
toc

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,399
and cncf sigs a lot also good acronyms

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,680
um but just to kind of expand that

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,880
expand on that

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,839
toc stands for technical oversight

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,800
committee

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,920
and sig stands for special interest

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,720
groups

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,839
so the technical oversight committee is

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,880
a group of

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,839
about 11 people and they are

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,279
responsible for the technical vision of

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,519
the cncf

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,640
they also vote on the projects that come

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,160
into the cncf

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,680
at all the levels cncf sigs

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:02,720
are focused on particular areas like

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,279
app delivery or observability or

00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,640
networking or security so they have

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,680
their own like verticals

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,360
and these are groups of domain experts

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,680
that

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
build their own uh guidance and

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,480
documentation around

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,079
what is going on in terms of in the cncf

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,880
and the broader ecosystem in their

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,440
vertical

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,959
but also uh they advise the technical

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,640
oversight committee on

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,079
the projects that are submitted to the

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,600
cncf so they're

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:35,120
very key to this whole organization

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,079
liz rice who is the toc chair um will be

00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:40,000
doing a more

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,640
in-depth session on the toc and the sigs

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and i recommend attending her session to

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,839
learn a lot more

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,480
about this stuff and more information

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,600
about the sigs and the toc can be found

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,920
on the cncf toc github repository

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,200
um so if you want to join in or figure

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,760
out when they meet

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,200
um all of that what all of that

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,880
information is listed

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,120
and linked on the github repo

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,959
and throughout the day you'll also

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,440
throughout the next few days you'll also

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,440
see uh sig sessions so there are

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,720
kubernetes sigs that are kubernetes

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,640
project specific

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,079
and then there's cncf sigs which are

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:21,839
cncf uh

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,600
broader um and uh broader

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,720
groups that focus on those verticals

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,680
that we're talking about that i was

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,240
talking about

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,680
so um just check those out there's

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,959
introduction sessions if you just want

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,760
to get a glimpse of what people are

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:33,440
working on

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,760
and there's longer deep dive sessions i

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,959
think uh those are more for

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,839
like deeper discussions for the uh sig

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,680
uh group members to meet and hash things

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:48,399
out face to face generally

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:50,480
so um both good things to look out for

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,200
all right let's talk about project

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,200
maintainers

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,959
so you also hear the term project

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,120
maintainers quite a bit

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,480
and and this is if you're not familiar

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,399
with open source

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
uh or this kind of

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,880
ecosystem and environment uh let me just

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,800
explain for a second like what a project

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,360
maintainer is

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,800
so project maintainers are responsible

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
for the code base

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,000
and documentation of a particular

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,560
project

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,839
they review and contribute code and

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,040
documentation

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,079
they um so they will like you know fix

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,000
buds

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,120
uh review and contribute um

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
features uh they'll also help with the

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,000
with building and releasing the project

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,639
any maintenance ongoing maintenance

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,959
work uh just like upkeep reviewing and

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,040
fixing security related concerns

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,480
so they're the keepers of of the code

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
base essentially

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,839
um and and they're the people you want

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,440
to go talk to

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,440
if you have any questions or if you want

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
to like propose something

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
yes um so earlier on the subject of

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,680
attending sessions i mentioned that

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,760
there are different tracks um you

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,360
uh well i now want to focus on

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,720
specifically the maintainer track so

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
again it's start

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,839
um cncf projects are on the maintainer

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,519
track there

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,279
are intro and deep dive sessions like

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,440
there are for the sig sessions

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,279
and you can filter by the maintain your

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
track sessions to find them

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,399
um and also if you're on the lookout for

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,399
the project pavilion so

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,519
here you can find project maintainers of

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,800
various cncf

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:28,720
incubating and graduated projects so

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,240
there will be project specific booths

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,000
essentially and

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,920
depending on the team there will be

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,760
maintainers on standby to help answer

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,839
questions and some of the projects will

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,199
also be doing office hours so be on the

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,639
lookout for that

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,800
um and yeah anything else michelle any

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,440
questions that people should ask

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,399
um yeah well on the project pavilion bit

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,959
i think like

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,560
i always enjoy that so i hope folks take

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,279
advantage of it

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
i'm a maintainer and i really enjoy

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,880
standing at the booth and

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,120
talking to people who are thinking about

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,040
using our project or using our project

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,480
and you know just want to have a quick

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,519
session um just

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,880
even me you know like i love hearing

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,279
what people are working on and um and uh

00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,600
love understanding how they're using the

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,079
project and what gaps they see

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,760
but then also as a someone who uses a

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,839
bunch of these projects i love

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,199
having the opportunity to go and meet

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,079
the maintainers and

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,639
just say hi you know like it's so nice

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:31,120
to put

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:34,720
a face uh to a github handle

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,839
so yeah so when you do meet people um

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:42,000
share a little bit about yourself

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,120
self how their project can help you

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,800
ask how to get started and ask how you

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,560
can get involved because a lot of times

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,760
there's community meetings or slack

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,480
channels or

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,720
other ways of being involved long term

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,160
in case you have questions or

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,399
want to just contribute or something

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
like that all right so next we're going

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,240
to talk about approaching the sponsor

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,240
hall

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,480
um we know at first glance this is also

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,240
going to look daunting

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,079
but the main thing to take away is that

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,160
the sponsor hall is the perfect

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,760
opportunity to chat with companies and

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,279
people in the ecosystem

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,600
so if you're looking for anything

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,639
specific in terms of like services or

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,240
solutions

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,079
this would be the perfect time to have

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,320
those conversations

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,839
and since this is a virtual event we

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,279
know the interaction is obviously going

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,519
to be different than normal

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,920
um so the way we're doing it this time

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,720
around is the sponsors will have a live

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
chat feature

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,800
at their booth where you can hold

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,279
one-on-one conversations with someone

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,720
and when it comes to asking questions um

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,839
you know we're still pushing the same

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,800
thing in terms of like things you should

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,160
bring up right

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,279
um more things you can talk about are um

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,880
you know aside from like what you're

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,079
working on and what you do like share if

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,600
you have a specific

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,880
problem that you're trying to solve or

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,240
if you just want to hear what's out

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,440
there right like if you're just here to

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,000
learn

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,360
another thing is to ask others what

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
problems they're working on

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,040
why something is a problem in the first

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,440
place even and how they're trying to

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,440
solve it

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,920
yeah and don't forget to check out the

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
smaller booths you know the big booths

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,360
are great

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,759
um but people are innovating at all

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,320
levels so this is your chance to get in

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,759
early

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,800
on um what people are working on and and

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:26,000
they're really cool new projects

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,360
and also there's a booth crawl so don't

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,120
forget to check that out

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,639
unfortunately we aren't going to be

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,959
having any cute

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,079
beverages and snacks which i always

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,040
enjoy

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,959
but this is a dedicated window of time

00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,440
to check out the sponsor hall without

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,480
any

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,519
uh competing activities like um

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,560
sessions or keynotes yeah um

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,560
and then lastly um so swag real quick

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,720
it's just like our industry term to say

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,320
giveaways essentially um

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,079
they're really just meant to help you

00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,920
remember interactions that you've had

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,199
so obviously that's gonna be different

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,120
around um

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,959
this time around uh but be on the

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,039
lookout for virtual swag

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,880
so for example i designed um some

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,079
crossword puzzles and word searches for

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
the microsoft group

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,919
um so you know check that out i'm just

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,679
really curious to see like what creative

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,919
forms of swag people have come up with

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,360
this time around

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,559
same here all right let's talk about the

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,000
hallway track

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:26,079
um so this is also an industry term

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,520
if you go to a lot of conference you've

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,640
probably heard of conferences you've

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,880
probably heard of this

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,320
but if you're not familiar uh hallway

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,760
track is how we refer

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,520
to um basically forgoing the sessions

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,720
watching the recordings and just hanging

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,880
out in the sponsor hall

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,559
and networking and meeting up with

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,600
people from the community

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,640
um so we'll basically chat

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,840
catch up work on things

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,080
sometimes even on code which is cool uh

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
if you are you know networking with

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,080
people

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,919
um here are some things you can share

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,919
make sure you tell people that this is

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,760
your first time attending kubecon

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,000
everybody gets really excited when you

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,200
like say that uh talk about what you're

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,360
looking for

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,320
how much exposure you've had to cncf

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,400
technologies

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,240
if you've contributed to anything if

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
you've just read some dots if you tried

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,760
something out

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,520
and that's always very helpful and also

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,360
um share your professional background

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,840
what you're working on who your employer

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,360
is and projects you've contributed to

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,360
in the past um

00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,440
uh i think there's a slot channel for

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,160
this event karen you want to talk about

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,960
that

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,880
yeah so um the main i think main form of

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,200
communication at least text-wise

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,559
is going to be on slack so make sure to

00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,240
sign up for slack

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,559
um you should be able to find a link in

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,039
the email that you get for the events

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,320
and it will be organized by track

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,720
specific channels

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,679
um and also be on the lookout for extra

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
channels for

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,960
networking and if you're not already

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,360
familiar with slack

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,520
definitely check it out um our community

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,679
the cncf you know kubernetes community

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,400
heavily relies on slack for real-time

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,400
communications

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:13,200
all right the fun stuff social events

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,600
yeah so um during a normal physical

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,679
event

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,720
social events are obviously a great way

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:18,880
to meet people

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,039
um nonetheless they're still pretty

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,760
important and valuable to participate in

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,160
virtually

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,600
um you know when you're on a virtual

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,280
conference right or when you're at a

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,160
virtual conference it can be super

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,520
draining

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,440
just to be on the computer all day and

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,840
like super focused um

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,360
so just kind of take these virtual

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,799
social events as a

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,520
as a reminder to take a break right um

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:43,679
and you know social events to me also

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,520
communicate the kind of culture that a

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,240
community is really trying to foster

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,840
so um yeah i would highly recommend

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
checking out the events that we have

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,720
organized

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,320
yeah and there are quite a few of them

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,960
um listed here

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,799
i'm excited about this game games lounge

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
uh sponsored by red hat there's a

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,159
virtual

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,400
job board sponsored by aws musical

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:10,400
performance by michael hicks and

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:12,159
drag queen bingo so pops about that

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,720
yeah huge shout out to the events team

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,280
for organizing all of this for us

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,760
yes they're always great in person and

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,559
i'm

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,200
very excited about the virtual ones too

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,360
yeah

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,240
so um let's take a moment to look

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,480
forward now

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,919
um if you're interested in speaking at a

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,640
future conference

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,200
you'll want to consider submitting a cfp

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,000
and

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,039
what is a cfe so it stands for call for

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,600
papers and

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,640
anyone can submit um this is the process

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,080
that is used

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,799
to select talks for um you know kubecon

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,799
conferences

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,880
and these talks are reviewed by a

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,520
program committee made up of community

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,080
members

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:51,600
and you know together they work to build

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,240
out the conference schedule

00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,960
so some general outlines um to think

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,720
about or

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
general guidelines to think about when

00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,760
it comes to cfps

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,200
are that sessions are meant to cover

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,600
open source technologies

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,240
and should be vendor neutral so as a

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,679
speaker

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,159
you know we're here to push innovation

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,840
and not necessarily to sell anything

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,840
and there are a lot of different formats

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:14,400
you can consider so you can consider

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,120
doing a regular presentation

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,679
a panel lightning talks and you know

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,679
take your pick

00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,320
awesome and uh so karen and i

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,960
have both done um keynotes as well as

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,799
session

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,360
uh like regular sessions at kubecon

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,480
cloudnativecon and other open source

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,520
conferences

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,799
and i was actually a um kubecon

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,520
conference chair in 2017 so

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,400
both of us have experience writing and

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,600
reviewing

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,840
uh conference proposals and

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,000
just i read thousands of them so i

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,919
wanted to like maybe pull out a few

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,880
bits to think about um before submitting

00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,240
so uh when you're thinking about

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:03,360
submitting or when you're

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,320
crafting your cfp make sure you clearly

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,799
articulate

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,960
uh the problem area in one to two

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,440
sentences so like what problem are you

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,240
solving set the scene one to two

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,360
sentences

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:18,960
super brief um and also talk about

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:22,400
uh what the audience will take away so

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,159
um your conference uh your cfp

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,679
will have a section on it called

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,000
abstract and these are the things that

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,080
you want to include in the abstract

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,120
and uh this is also the thing that will

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,280
be posted

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,400
on um sketch and on the conference

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,960
schedule

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,840
uh just as something that the audience

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,320
members will see

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,440
in order to figure out their if your

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,159
conference session is

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,720
um something that they would uh enjoy

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,000
and

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,440
take away and learn from so it's kind of

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
your pitch

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,799
so you also want to include your

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,520
expertise

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,240
and experience in the area did you build

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,440
this tool

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
in technology did you use it and like

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,039
really hurt

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
and like learn a lot along the way these

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,200
kinds of stories

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,480
really resonate with the community

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,600
and also talk about how uh your project

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:16,080
or your conference or

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,640
your project or your conference session

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,000
um

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,720
or your your use case or whatever you're

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,280
talking about

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,840
fits into the ecosystem and how your

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:29,039
session will help the ecosystem

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,400
grow and learn and also make sure you

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:34,159
ask people to review

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,080
i always send my cfps to folks

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,520
that i work with just to kind of glance

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,600
at give me any feedback

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,799
and i'm always happy to other uh read

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,120
other people's um

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,919
cfps too before they submit takes a few

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,080
minutes

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,120
and it's nice to just get another set of

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,240
eye on these things

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,080
eyes on these things it's easy yeah

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,240
um and as part of that review process as

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,480
well is like you know you can go

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,159
and check out previous abstracts as

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,559
examples um so

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,880
like what i will do sometimes is go to

00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,880

through the sessions there

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
um because obviously those are the ones

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,480
that got selected right so like they

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,880
serve as good examples of what i should

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:18,240
be sharing in my own cfps

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:20,960
