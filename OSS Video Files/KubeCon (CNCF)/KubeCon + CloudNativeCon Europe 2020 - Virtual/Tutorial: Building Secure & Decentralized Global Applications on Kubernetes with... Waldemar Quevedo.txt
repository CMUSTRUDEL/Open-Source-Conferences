Tutorial: Building Secure & Decentralized Global Applications on Kubernetes with NATS - Waldemar Quevedo, Synadia 

Learn how to build applications that span across more than one Kubernetes region by using a NATS based global communications network. In this talk, it will be covered how to setup a globally available NATS cluster using multiple Kubernetes regions from 4 different clouds (AWS, Digital Ocean, GKE & Azure) using NATS gateways and leafnode connections, as well as how to create applications that take advantage of the NATS decentralized authorization model by showing how to implement a simple Slack-like clone that runs under your terminal.  Attendees of this session will be able to follow through the implementation of the service (and interact with each other!) during the talk, to run the examples it is recommended to have Docker installed.
