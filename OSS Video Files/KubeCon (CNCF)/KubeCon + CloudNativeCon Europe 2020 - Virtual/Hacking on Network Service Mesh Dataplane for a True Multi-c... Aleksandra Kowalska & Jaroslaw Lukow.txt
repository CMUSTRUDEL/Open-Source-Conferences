Hacking on Network Service Mesh Dataplane for a True Multi-cloud Experience - Aleksandra Kowalska, Netcompany & Jaroslaw Lukow, Nine Fives Labs 

In this session the presenters will guide you through integrating Network Service Mesh with the Tungsten Fabric SDN controller as the dataplane tunnel provider. The session will bring both information about the NSM architecture and its use-cases. The TF's ubiquity of integrations (Kubernetes, OpenStack, VMware, physical appliances etc.) enables to demonstrate the true concept of cloud-native networking - when the location of the network service is irrevelant to the consumer and she can focus only on the required functionality. Thus, we can mix and match different clusters, orchestrators and technologies to provide a flexible networking environment.
