welcome to contributor experience we are

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,880
one of the 23 special interest groups in

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,399
kubernetes

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,960
in this talk we're going to go over who

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,960
we are what we do and how we do it

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,040
i'm george castro a community manager at

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,920
vmware and i'm bob killen a research

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,039
cloud administrator at the university of

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,480
michigan before we get started the

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
kubernetes community

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,160
is massive we have over 48 000

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
drive-by contributors that's how we

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,679
classify people who have submitted

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,519
issues or prs or fixes to kubernetes

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,320
and out of those we have about almost

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,640
1200 org members which we consider to be

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,399
for

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,280
developers who are larger contributors

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
to the project

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,800
we manage about 209 repositories in

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,079
github

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,239
and have processed almost 167 000

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,520
pull requests and have a healthy

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
community of

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:55,120
100 000 users in our slack that should

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,239
give you an understanding of who we are

00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,039
kubernetes is divided into 23 cigs 11

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
working groups

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
3 committees and 2 user groups we're

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,199
diverse sig with a lot of different

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,720
people with different backgrounds

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
work at different companies and

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,320
different interests we tend to be the

00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,479
meta sig for the project

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,400
if you consider kubernetes as a large

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,880
network of interconnected groups

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,720
we tend to be the grand central station

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,159
where cigs can collaborate around making

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,479
things better for themselves

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
and for new contributors if you have no

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,000
idea where to contribute then we'd be

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,840
honored to be your first sig

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,520
it's not uncommon for people to hang out

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,520
with us while they understand

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,799
and figure out how the project works and

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,200
then move on to whatever

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,920
specialized sig interests them more

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,079
remember

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,479
kubernetes is an operating system people

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,320
love to play with networking for a while

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,560
they want to learn how storage works and

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,240
they maybe dip their toes in the apis

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,079
there's no wrong way to do it and

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,360
there's never a shortage of work in any

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,320
area of kubernetes

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,759
so for us finding a place for you makes

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,159
us happy so you've met myself and bob

00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,159
sigs have co-chairs and tech leads who

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,360
are facilitators of the sig our job is

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,960
to keep the ball rolling

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,040
and ensuring people are empowered to

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,119
fulfill to do the things that they want

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,119
to do it's also a ton of fun

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,879
bob and i are your co-chairs and nikita

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,800
raganath and christoph blecker

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,640
are our technical leads we've been

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,840
selected to represent the sig as your

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,760
chairs and tech leads

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,879
we follow in the footsteps of the great

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
leads of the past

00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,840
like paris pittman elsie phillips and

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,840
garrett rodriguez

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,400
let's talk about teams kubernetes is

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,720
huge dividing and conquering

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,480
is really the only reasonable way to

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,200
accomplish a large amount of work at the

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,360
same time

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,239
so we tend to be divided into teams and

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,400
sub projects

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,480
which we'll get to in a little bit our

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,160
teams are we have an events team

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,920
we have a marketing team we have a

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
github administration team

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,360
we have a stream team which handles our

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
youtube work

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,680
we have a team of moderators an entire

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,120
team of people who handle the asia

00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,599
pacific time zone

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,120
and community managers which is our team

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,560
that is basically

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,239
if you're not in a team you're in the

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,040
community manager team and that's just

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,280
what we call ourselves

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,959
so what do we do you might have seen our

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,920
work doing your first pull request to

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,080
kubernetes

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,360
any given time we have a thousand or so

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,680
open pull requests

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
so we depend on automation to help put

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
those pr's in front of the right

00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,480
eyeballs

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,560
doing that requires assembling processes

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,280
for us to follow on how to do exactly

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,280
that

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,280
that's just one example of a process

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,319
that we work on we usually have one of

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,000
these processes

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,840
for every part of the contribution

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,680
process things like

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,760
when should we expire abandoned github

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,720
issues to what's the best way to onboard

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,560
a new person

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,280
to what kind of label should the project

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,360
use we do this for consistency reasons

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,519
so contributing to sig networking

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
should feel familiar to you if you've

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,680
contributed to

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,480
storage for example so we strive to get

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
contributors

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
consistent experience across the project

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
while at the same time providing

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,239
services to these other cigs

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
to make their lives easier

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,159
so first things first we have a nice

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,200
large list for you of every sig

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,920
here at this link this lists the sig the

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
co-chair

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,200
their slack channel their mailing list

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,200
and more importantly

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,959
their meetings and their meeting notes

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,280
all sig meetings are public

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
and have a public notes document this is

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,680
a great way to browse on what you want

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,440
to do

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,040
so if you start at this page click

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,720
around see what interests you

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,720
and then you can dig a little bit deeper

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,880
into each one of these sigs

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,400
we also publish a community calendar

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,320
which has all of those seg meetings and

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,720
other project meetings in one place

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,479
we recommend subscribing to the calendar

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,520
so that you can see what's going on in

00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,680
the community

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,000
also if you subscribe to that sig's

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,639
mailing list you will automatically get

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,680
a meeting invite to that sig's public

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
meeting

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,120
note that we're working on a contributor

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,880
site so these urls will become much more

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,400
friendlier and easier to remember

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,720
and we'll talk about that in a few

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,840
minutes

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,520
how we do it is via sub projects so what

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,280
we do is we take everything that the sig

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,199
owns and then we divide it into

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,880
conquerable areas that we apply a team

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,160
to a sub project

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,520
we're going to talk about the community

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
sub project which kind of owns and

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,039
manages the overall community repo

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,800
we will talk about the community

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,199
management subproject

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,280
which manages the operations and policy

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
for a lot of the things that we do here

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
contributor documentation is the home

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,400
for things our contributor

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,039
and developer guides and our contributor

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,520
website we will be covering devstats

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,639
which is our set of grafana dashboards

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
that tries to

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,680
gather all the metrics around

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,479
contributions so we can figure out

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,520
things like

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,000
pr velocity average mean time between a

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,560
pr

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
and merge and we can figure out who's

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,960
contributing where

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,639
and that gives us the data and

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,840
information that we need to make better

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,440
policy decisions

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,160
and to figure out where we can improve

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,160
as a project

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,400
events um so these mostly are

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,240
physical events some of you might have

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
attended a contributor summit we will be

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,160
talking about events

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,919
um and their effects going forward

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,560
especially in this calendar year

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,639
we have an entire sub-project dedicated

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,720
to github management so the kubernetes

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,880
code base does all live on github

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,560
and there's an entire subproject who

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,000
manages that and bob will be getting

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,199
into those details

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,479
kate's dot io is uh our home page and

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,160
it's the home of the kubernetes

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,919
infrastructure working group

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,280
in this video playlist there should be a

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,039
status and we will

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,560
briefly talk about some of the things

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,639
that we do there

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,280
mentoring of course um as a huge project

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,400
the best way to get things done is

00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,479
through mentorship

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,000
either group mentorship or one-to-one

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,520
mentorship there's no

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,600
guide or anything that we can write

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,840
that's better than people helping

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,440
themselves out to understand and figure

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,520
out how things work

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,960
so we have an entire sub-project to that

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,280
we will be dedicating

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,319
some time to tell you how that works and

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,360
then lastly

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,599
keeping a slack infrastructure healthy

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,039
is uh difficult especially with such a

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,319
large group so we're going to cover some

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,479
of the tools and

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,199
policies that we've put in place to make

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,280
that fun

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,360
so first community management mailing

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,960
lists and calendars fall under this

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,400
all of our mailing lists are hosted on

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,120
google groups and as i've been

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,120
mentioning

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
um all these six have a public mailing

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,199
list and meetings

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,960
it's not uncommon for sigs to publish

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,759
their meeting notes regularly on their

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,919
mailing list

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,520
it's usually the first place where you

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,360
want to ask a question

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,919
or interact with members of the

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,520
community so we host these as a project

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,479
in one place

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,400
for us a sick contributor experience we

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,800
do maintain these and kind of do the

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
infrastructure plumbing background so

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,199
hopefully

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,440
your interaction with mailing list is

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,120
just as a user and we've currently made

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,400
some progress in these areas to make

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,560
this uh

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,680
less painful and easier to manage for

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
those of you that are using

00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,199
and multiple mailing lists all you

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,680
really need to do is join the mailing

00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,680
lists

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,319
and figure out how to organize the mail

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,360
in whatever email service you use

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,759
youtube youtube.com kubernetes community

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,440
is the home to all of our youtube videos

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,400
not only will you find all the sig

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,319
meeting

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,160
uh zoom recordings in there but you will

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,319
also find some top level meetings

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
that we do host in there so for example

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
we have a monthly community meeting that

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,560
covers all aspects of the project

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
we have instructional videos we have

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,800
code walkthroughs of certain

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,360
uh areas of the code base the release

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,680
team

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,840
after every release does an entire

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,759
postmortem of the release process that

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,680
gets recorded and put in there

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,440
so if you subscribe to this you will be

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,159
getting weekly updates of things that

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,320
are happening

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,839
all over the kubernetes community and

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,680
it's an excellent resource

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,959
if you want to catch up on the long tail

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,800
of things like that this

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,640
uh sub project is managed by the stream

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,279
team and we're always looking for more

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
members

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,480
we do have these meetings and sometimes

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
we have special events and things like

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,320
that

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,000
and those are recorded and put on

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,040
youtube and that's done by a set of

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,600
volunteers

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,360
so we try to as a global project to

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,200
cover all sorts of time zones

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,040
so when we do have live streaming events

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,560
that cover for example europe and the

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,480
east coast of the us

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,920
we'd love to bring that kind of content

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,480
also to people who live in the west

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,279
coast

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,160
or asia pacific so in order to do that

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
if you've got

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
obs skills or you know how to manage

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
youtube channels

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,800
for your video editor perhaps or you

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,399
know how to make pretty looking slide

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,560
intros for people's videos

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
we could always use skills like that so

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,120
please let us know if

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,160
you're interested in something like that

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,200
the community management subproject one

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,399
of its main tasks

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,640
is owning stuff uh github.com

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,760
kubernetes kubernetes is where

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,640
kubernetes

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,600
the software itself lives github.com

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,240
kubernetes

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
community is the community repo here you

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,920
will find things like our governance

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,040
documentation election procedures

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,560
our values our code of conduct

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,279
and any kind of the projects that are

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,200
happening around the project

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,480
tend to live in the community repo and

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,680
that is owned

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,839
by uh this sub project

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,680
zoom there's a lot of things that this

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,120
sig does for zoom as far as managing the

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,560
licenses that we need

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,480
so that sig chairs can run their

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,120
meetings and record them and all sorts

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,360
of stuff

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,360
as an end user contributor you generally

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
don't need to deal with any of this

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,240
but if you do know how to administer

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,120
these tools like i said we always could

00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,279
use some help

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,959
however you can help us out by ensuring

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,760
that the zoom client on your computer is

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,640
up to date

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,480
they are constantly adding new features

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,000
especially around moderation that we are

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,000
always using and consuming

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,200
and it never hurts to keep up with your

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,440
security updates

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,839
so keep your clients up to date

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,959
discuss.kubernetes.io is our

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,000
discourse-powered

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,560
community forums it's a more

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,079
user-web-friendly way

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,800
to have discussions if you're not

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,640
interested in

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,160
developer mailing list so we kind of run

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,839
this for our end users

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
you will find developers there you will

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,920
find people who might have the same

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,880
interest

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,399
the same questions um and it's just a

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,360
nice long

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,959
uh huge forum full of information

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,519
everything from cube cuddle

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,279
tips and tricks to hey everybody check

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,600
out this cool post that i saw about

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,079
kubernetes so it's a great way to spin

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,320
up on kubernetes information

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,839
moderators each of these tools and

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,519
properties that we use whether that's

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:18,240
zoom youtube slack

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,680
discourse all need moderators we do have

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,480
a code of conduct that needs to be

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,600
enforced

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,959
we do expect when someone comes to one

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,240
of our properties that they will have a

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,480
wonderful friendly

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,360
user experience and for that we depend

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,600
on a large group of moderators across

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
almost every time zone in the world to

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
make sure that we're just keeping things

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
nice and clean we are always looking for

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,480
more moderators

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,399
especially if you're in the asia-pacific

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,440
time zone to help give us that global

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
coverage that we need

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,399
upstream marketing used to be part of

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,880
community management

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,440
however thanks to people like matt

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,200
broberg

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,200
this is a great example of a project

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,959
that started out small and has now

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
is well on its way of becoming its own

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,480
sub-project this project was initially

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
started by paris pittman

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,120
and this is is an example on how we hand

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,399
projects off to people as they onboard

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,240
into kubernetes

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,680
and tell us what they're interested in

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,279
and then just find something that

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,880
they're passionate about and then just

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,600
take it over so this team was

00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,360
established

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,040
last year they've set up an entire

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
communication framework

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,959
we've got a new twitter account that

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,959
will just have

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,200
information and use specifically for

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,519
contributors to allow us to give

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,399
users more information in a place that's

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,399
consistent

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,600
so they can find out what's going on and

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,200
not depend on

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
slides like this all the time to figure

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,959
out what's going on in the project

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,480
there's plenty of things to do here in

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,680
this team and before i hand it off to

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
bob just a reminder

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,639
a lot of these teams that you see the

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
people that are volunteering and working

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,880
here

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,680
you do not need to be a developer or a

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,920
programmer

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
we always need project management help

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,560
any kind of social experience you might

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,360
have

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,920
and just you know be passionate about

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,680
something

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,839
there's always things that we need help

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,079
with and if we can't find a thing

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,920
that you can help us out we'll always

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,040
work to find a place for you

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
and with that we'll move on to

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
documentation well it's my turn to take

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,880
over

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,720
so i want to dive right into our

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,040
documentation it is sort of a

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,079
living set of documents and with that

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,120
it's sort of like

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,040
is broken down into two broad areas

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,560
the contributor guide this is something

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,639
everyone should be familiar with whether

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:31,440
you are helping write documentation

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,880
uh running issue triage sessions uh or

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,000
more it's sort of the base level of

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,279
knowledge to

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,920
be effective in our community

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,360
next is the developer guide this focuses

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,399
more specifically on developing

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,120
kubernetes

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,160
things like going best practices how to

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,959
write tests

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,360
api best practices and much more uh this

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
is

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,199
currently also going undergoing a

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,240
significant rework with the help of joel

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,160
barker and eric

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
aronson two tech writers that are

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,440
helping us sort of with our information

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,399
architecture and sort of restructuring

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,519
uh documentation to be much more helpful

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,040
sorry

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,800
on both of these things we're always

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,839
also looking for more uh help with

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,519
revising them

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,560
especially new contributors who can

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,680
approach them with sort of the

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,920
beginner's mind

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,199
there's always details uh that we as

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,360
more experienced computers overlook and

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,199
these little things will help many

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,240
others going forward

00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,199
lastly we have our contributor site this

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,199
we really want

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,320
to publish soon hopefully by the time

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,560
this is actually live

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,000
the site will be live but the the sort

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,040
of the idea behind it is that the

00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,399
our documentation in github is uh not

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,240
very discoverable

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
and having a single website you could go

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,279
to for things like the contributor guy

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,240
the developer guide or calendar and some

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,360
other resources

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,959
would be extremely valuable

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,399
and as well as helping with our general

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:52,480
information discoverability problems

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,680
the next project or sub project is dev

00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,880
stats um

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,880
as george mentioned earlier this is sort

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,079
of a tool to help visualize our github

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:02,079
activity

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:04,079
it uses the github archives to sort of

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,079
crunch a bunch of data and calculate

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,680
various things on github events

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,519
and this can give us things like pr

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,760
velocity how many and who

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,519
like who is contributing it's where we

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,199
get some of our numbers for

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,680
the first slide that we had in this

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,600
stack so like the number of contributors

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,279
now historically it has been actually

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,800
super useful for our community groups

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,639
like our sigs and working groups

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,320
but one of our contributors lori apple

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,920
has been spearheading an effort to build

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,600
some better dashboards

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,040
that we can use especially when it comes

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,680
to trying to find some

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,000
like good community health metrics and

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,160
if sifting through data is your thing

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,279
this might be uh this might be of

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,040
interest and

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,839
if you're interested please feel free to

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,959
reach out in slack

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,639
next is events now events have been hit

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,800
hard this year

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,560
we regularly host three contributors

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,440
contributor summits a year alongside

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,079
kubecon

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,519
and each one has its own event team sort

00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,440
of modeled off

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,880
our release team with their shadow

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,600
program it's been one of our more

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,199
success

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,839
successful means we've had for

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,279
onboarding new contributors

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,959
these events are always a great

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,240
opportunity for contributors to get like

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,240
face time with each other

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,360
we also have social activities there's

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,120
lots of content

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,440
to help contributors sort of level up

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,519
with regard to things like writing tests

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,120
hunting flakes or how to write a better

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,360
api

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
we might wind up doing a virtual event

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,160
for kubecon north america later this

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,040
year but it's still

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,000
uh sort of to be determined if you are

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,360
interested in that sort of thing

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,959
please subscribe to the kubernetes dev

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,519
mailing list and all communications

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,360
regarding that will be sent to that

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:38,800
the other big thing that our events team

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,720
handles is

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,160
the elections for our steering committee

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,800
so our steering committee

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,680
elections happen once a year and members

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,720
that are appointed to the steering

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,199
committee are elected

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,240
for a two-year term and these sort of

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,000
sort of uh

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,920
set the policy for some of their project

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,320
and and i'll join steer it

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,920
um and then we as contributor experience

00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,880
are sort of the executors of the

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,880
of the policy

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,600
the next project is sort of near and

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,559
dear to my heart and that is github

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,079
management

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,919
uh this sub project along with the

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,919
github admin team manage how

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,480
contributors interact with github

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,120
along with like you know becoming an org

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,319
member

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,799
as well as like creating and managing

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,160
repos and some of the more recent stuff

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,799
we've been working on has been sort of

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,439
designing

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,319
um defining the the member life cycle

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,480
policy

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,600
so the project is now six years old and

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,200
people are not expected to be

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,880
contributing to it forever

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,400
but with org membership becomes an

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,000
elevated set of permissions

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,679
and being able to use our ci without

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,640
checks as well as like potentially sign

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,000
off on code

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,320
so we need to think about like

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,320
off-boarding as well

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,799
one of the other initiatives under the

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,840
github management project

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,000
has been to retire one of our

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,080
older orgs kubernetes incubator it was

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
an idea several years ago to try out uh

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,840
some like try some things need to decide

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,600
if a project should be accepted in the

00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
project or if it should be spun back out

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,480
on its own

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,919
and this process had a whole slew of

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,960
issues and sort of been released

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,280
released replaced by a different process

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,200
and at the time of this recording there

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,840
are just two repos left

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,640
and the final decisions on those either

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,880
being

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,559
brought into the org or being spun out

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,799
should be reached by the end of july

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,960
making the changes hopefully going in

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,039
place in august

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,160
lastly we have an upcoming initiative

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,000
and that's to begin to

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,760
prune some of our our repos that have

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,280
gone inactive

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,280
we have 209 repos and with this project

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,799
being you know six years old

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,559
there are some that were like sort of

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,080
experiments and other ideas that aren't

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,880
really actively being maintained on

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,240
anymore

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,559
it just makes sense for them to be

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
archived and and this is sort of like it

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,039
seems like a lot of janitorial work but

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,400
it's essential to the project

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,039
nonetheless now before

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
i jump right into our next sub project

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
mentoring

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,840
there is a little bit of a prerequisite

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,880
i want to just sort of get out of the

00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,559
way so

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,559
this is known as the latter and i want

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,320
to credit the slide to one of our

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,160
contributors gwenevere singer who came

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,200
with the original version of this

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,960
um and it sort of covers the process of

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:13,360
you know as a you know as a non-um

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,320
member contributor you then go on to

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,520
become a

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,760
member after you like you know

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,480
contribute a little bit and over time

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,919
you became

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,280
you may become more familiar with an

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,640
area of the code base and you might

00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,240
start reviewing pr's

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,760
and eventually you get pr into what we

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,559
refer to as an owner's file as a

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,240
reviewer

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,080
this means that you'll be sort of the

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,360
first line of defense when it comes to

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:35,280
reviewing pr's as they're coming in

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,720
now after spending some time as a

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,160
reviewer you become a bit more of a

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,039
subject matter expert in that area of

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,360
the code base

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,880
you reviewed a bunch of prs and you'll

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,720
get promoted to an approver which means

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,960
you can actually sign off and allow that

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,559
code to be merged

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
and you know let's say you start to

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,240
learn more about other areas and other

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,320
areas under the sig

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
you may become a higher level approver

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,080
for like an entire subproject

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,760
so you might graduate then to like sort

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,520
of helping set goals and outline the

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,400
milestones for the entire subproject

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,240
itself

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,640
and potentially eventually become a

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,200
sickly um

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,960
and this in itself is is this whole

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,240
thing is referred to as the ladder

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,840
and now for many the first big hurdle is

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,679
making the jump from a non-member to

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,559
member but our mentoring initiatives are

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,840
here to help people

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,840
climb the ladder itself

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,200
and mentoring mentorship is just

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,880
essential to overall project health

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,400
i was just talking about contributing

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,159
life cycle and off-boarding but

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,440
mentoring is how we bring on new

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,159
contributors and help our current

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,679
contributors

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,960
grow into the roles and become

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,400
sub-project owners in future sig leads

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,720
and with that we have a couple different

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,320
programs the first

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,400
is meet our contributors it is a

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,640
one-hour sort of ask me anything

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,480
with a panel of current contributors the

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,480
audience for this is tends to be like 50

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,280
50 split between both new and current

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,120
contributors

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,360
and some of our more common questions

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,840
include like how do i get started

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,880
how can i get my pr reviewed faster and

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,600
how do i hunt down a flake

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,840
next we have our group mentoring cohort

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,360
where we are looking to work

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,600
more with sigs and sort of build a

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,280
program targeting active contributors

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:15,120
this is specifically to get more

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,400
reviewers and improvers in a certain

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,159
area of the code base

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,000
we have an initiative right now with sig

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,799
node but we're looking to set some up

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,840
with others

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,880
if you are a sig lead or a sub project

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,360
owner and you're interested in this sort

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,159
of thing

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,159
please reach out if interested next is

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,679
sort of a sort of broad category of

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,600
shadow programs

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,760
and this happens to be one of the best

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,240
ways to build a path towards

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,919
a sustainable contributor base is to

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,080
build a team with roles

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,159
these are often well scoped with a lead

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,000
and one more shadows with the assumption

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,600
built into the shadow that the shadow

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,440
will eventually take over with lead

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,280
sort of creating this self-sustaining

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,120
cycle this has been used to

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,840
great effect within both our release

00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,400
team and events teams

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,919
next we have the one-on-one hour this is

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,080
something actually isn't used too much

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,080
just because it requires a lot of time

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,600
but we try and offer the ability for

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
people to book time and ask

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,440
questions with a more experienced

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,280
contributor one-on-one

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,120
we also have two major internship

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,320
programs working with google for the

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,640
google summer of code

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,320
and the outreachy internship program i

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
believe both are done for the remainder

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,679
of the year

00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,880
but look um like subscribe to the

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,840
curious dev mailing list if you're

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
interested in this sort of thing in the

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,799
future

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,240
next we have our new contributor

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,280
workshop

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,760
this has its own slide itself it happens

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,360
to be

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,600
one of our largest mentoring programs

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,240
and we tend we've we've previously held

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,679
it alongside contributor summits and it

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,760
actually used to be under the events

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,760
sub-project but it has since

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,200
moved out and moved under mentoring

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,280
earlier this year

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,720
and this is because hosting in person

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,159
had a lot of difficulties

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,159
there are a lot of issues with hotel

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,840
wi-fi networking

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,799
corporate laptops being locked down and

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,799
it just led to a degraded experience

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,919
and so moving it uh to an online only

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,679
event where you can sort of

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,600
make your own curriculum and it's sort

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,960
of like the content itself sort of

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,880
mirrors our contributor guide

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,880
while diving deeper into areas like

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,880
areas like local build and testing

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,919
this piecemeal approach means that if

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,080
you like you've already got

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,280
go in your go environment set up you can

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,480
skip to the sections that are more

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,720
relevant to you

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,280
um such as the the like repo tour and

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,960
if you're an experienced contributor uh

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,520
preferably with good or a good recording

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,280
setup

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,679
we'd love your help tackling some of

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:36,480
these uh sections of recording a

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:39,679
a a good presentation for it

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,559
and with that that takes us to uh slack

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,120
and from

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,919
slack infra you know as we said we have

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,440
a slack

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,600
workspace with over a hundred thousand

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
users and maintaining a safe space for

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,159
them

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,640
can can pose quite a challenge and we've

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,919
sort of had to build our own tooling

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,840
to help manage it all now slack itself

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,200
is not really designed for open

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,799
communities and it sort of expects you

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,159
to be able to go to your hr person if

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,559
you have an issue with someone

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,600
um that doesn't really work so well in

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,440
an open group

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,360
and one of our contributors catherine

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,360
berry built a tooling that lets us

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,640
manage slack through git as well as

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,480
edits a like

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,320
plugin so we now have a the function to

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,159
be like report messages

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,640
and these things will sort of bubble up

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,440
to our sac admin team for review

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,880
um we also have some upcoming things

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,600
that we intend to work on

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,880
uh such as automating postings to

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,760
analysis for things like security

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
announcements

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,120
as well as being able to delegate

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,640
moderation capabilities to channel

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,760
owners uh this is because there are a

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
lot of projects

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,720
that are hosted within the kubernetes

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
slack and for some we'd like to be able

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,320
to

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,559
or they'd like to be able to manage

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,400
their own community before potentially

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:48,159
asked to like bubble up or escalate to

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,880
uh up to us as full slack admins

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
lastly this is not a sub project but

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,240
something that is uh

00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,440
very important to us and that is the

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,440
naming working group

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,840
sig controbex is one of the sponsors for

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,279
this new working group

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,039
and sort of the idea behind it is to

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,039
help establish a set of inclusive

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,440
language and suggestions on how we can

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:08,480
up

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:09,679
update different parts of the project

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,840
one of the big things for on the

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,200
contribute side it will be the managing

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,960
the eventual switch

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,279
for the git master branch to something

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
else likely main at this point and we

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,360
are currently working with github

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,640
and sort of waiting to sort of see what

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,559
they can do to help us with that

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,000
migration process

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,080
when this is scheduled to occur you can

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,520
expect quite a bit of uh

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,279
like comms going out to the kubernetes

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,919
mailing list as well as on the twitter

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,919
and elsewhere

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:37,919
so how can you contribute you've heard

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
us talk about

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,600
how people are onboarding themselves on

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
the contributor ladder and things like

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,559
that

00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,679
so no matter what people are the center

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,000
of kubernetes

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,960
um yeah we do make some software that

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,120
people love and

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,480
love to use but for us the contributor

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,039
experience is really what we're all

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,720
about

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,039
so for us it's about our mission to make

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,120
contributing contributing to kubernetes

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,960
easier and ensure that we have a diverse

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,640
sustainable contributor base

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
that will keep driving the project

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,600
forward for years to come

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,360
so how do you actually get involved

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,799
getting involved is as easy as attending

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,400
your very first sig meeting

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,840
joining a sick mailing list will usually

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,520
send you a meeting invite as well for

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,120
that meeting so in the beginning when i

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,799
showed you that list of sigs

00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,720
it feel free to just kind of browse

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,600
around we have links to all of their

00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,440
archives

00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,440
and then see what interests you most

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,960
cigs have reserved time for new people

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,679
to introduce themselves during the

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,840
meeting

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,279
and co-chairs and experienced members of

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,360
the kubernetes community

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,200
are almost always out on the lookout for

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,840
new people to make them feel welcome

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,480
so feel free to join a meeting introduce

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,240
yourself

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,760
tell us what you're interested in tell

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,279
us why you're there

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,279
you know you might be interested in

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,559
joining to contribute or maybe there's a

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,120
thing that you need fixed

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,159
for example so just join the meeting and

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,159
get involved

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,480
and for that i've assembled some tips

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:56,559
here on your very first sig meeting

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,000
the first is always find a buddy there's

00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,440
a saying that says if you want to go

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,320
fast go by yourself

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,840
if you want to go far go as a group so

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,600
for me initially when i was getting

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,880
started in the community i found a buddy

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,559
who was able to help me

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,559
someone that was at my same level and we

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,919
kind of bounced ideas off of each other

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,679
or if we got stuck with something we

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,360
helped each other out and i also

00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,480
regularly sought out someone who was

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
more experienced

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
who could help me out as i was learning

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,440
you can either find this among

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
co-workers if you have

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,720
co-workers that have worked in

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,080
kubernetes before or

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,880
you could just find one in a sig

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,799
meeting for example volunteering to take

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,799
notes is a very good way to learn what's

00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,559
going on in kubernetes very quickly

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:38,399
usually the co-chairs and tech leads are

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,840
running the meeting whosoever is working

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,679
on the thing that's

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,200
being discussed on the agenda is usually

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,600
doing the meeting and there

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,960
usually needs to be someone to actually

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,640
pay attention to take

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,919
good notes so that we can share those

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,960
with the mailing list and the rest of

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,520
the community

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,120
so because taking notes forces you to

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,159
pay attention you can attend the meeting

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,559
without being

00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,200
tempted to open a new tab and go do

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,360
something else

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,799
and i found it a really great way to

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,200
kind of get yourself

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,000
up to speed on who's who what they're

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,480
working on

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,200
and what what's important to people as

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,520
as they

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,440
as you attend the meeting attending

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,320
regularly is also pretty important

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,200
kubernetes releases four times a year

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,120
usually

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,720
um so uh attending regularly if you miss

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,159
a month's worth of meanings

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,080
and it's a weekly meeting you know that

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,600
is a lot of velocity that you've missed

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,640
out on so usually i try to attend

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,840
regularly

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
especially if it's something that you're

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,440
really interested in if there are other

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,960
parts of the project we're only you're

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,120
only mildly interested in

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,799
uh you could just attend meetings on a

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,080
less regular basis

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:42,000
and always remember that small

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,919
dependable contributions is

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,159
always better than volunteering for the

00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,880
world and not being able to accomplish

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,600
anything

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,120
we've all been there you've you've found

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,039
this great project that really

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,880
you're into you're starting to really

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,000
like the people you you see people that

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,520
you admire doing

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,960
so many great things and then you're

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,240
going to want to go to every sig and

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,440
volunteer for everything

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,000
and then you're going to find yourself

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,440
in a ball like an in the ball of anxiety

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,960
wondering why you volunteered for all

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,399
these things and you just started and

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,039
now you have no idea where to get

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,200
started

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,320
so you can start contributing we have

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,080
people who contribute

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,000
one hour a month and have done so

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,760
consistently for years

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,679
and that is a thing that you can always

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,840
kind of depend on so

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,360
do not bite off more than you can chew

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,320
uh no one's going to yell at you for not

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,720
volunteering

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:28,960
enough you're the one doing us the favor

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,440
so do find something that is easy for

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,600
you

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,520
while you figure out what to do and as

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,520
you get gain experience

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,200
and figure out and start to meet other

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,440
people and start to figure out

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,720
where you're exactly going to fit in the

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,720
machine um

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
then at that point you can decide to

00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,240
chew on some stuff

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,320
sig should have a list of good first

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,559
issues uh this is a github label

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,640
we also use a help wanted label uh so

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,240
you cigs have hey welcome

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,480
here's you know here's a list of good

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
first issues feel free to dive in

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,760
since everyone is busy all the time and

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,679
the project is so busy

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,840
some sigs maintain these lists better

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,600
than others if you go to a sig and they

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
don't have these or they only have a few

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,320
things

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,840
that is also a great place because you

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,480
can use your beginner's mind as a new

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,559
person

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,080
to kind of help us figure out what

00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,360
things are appropriate for new people

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,840
and what things aren't

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,720
so in some ways if you don't find what's

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,679
good for

00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,360
new people to work on figuring that out

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,240
i know it sounds kind of meta is a great

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,919
way to contribute

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,679
we have plenty of non-code role

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,000
opportunities like the stream team

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,360
slack administration but there are many

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,120
many things in

00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,640
uh contributor experience that don't

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,480
require elevated permissions

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
where we could always use your help so

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,960
please don't feel that you need to know

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,679
uh go or python or be a programmer at

00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,399
all

00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,080
we have a large group of people who come

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,840
from program management backgrounds

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,279
and myself who are not an engineer i

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,080
come from a system administrator

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,320
background

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,200
so together with all of these skills

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,440
that we have

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
that is how the sig gets things done we

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,640
do it together as opposed to trying to

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,519
expect everyone to learn things that

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,720
they're not

00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,519
um proficient in and with that you can

00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,919
always find us

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,720
on slump with these handles um and these

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,799
are also github

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,080
handles uh the home page readme there

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,000
will take you to

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,279
a summary that has the links of just

00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,640
about everything i've talked

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,039
about here links to our sub projects

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,760
sub-projects things of that nature

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,600
and then of course our uh trebek's

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,159
mailing list which has the

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,120
um asynchronous forms of communication

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,039
and with that

00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,799
