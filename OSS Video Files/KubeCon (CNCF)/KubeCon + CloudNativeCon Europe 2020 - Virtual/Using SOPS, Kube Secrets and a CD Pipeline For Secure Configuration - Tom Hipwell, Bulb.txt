Using SOPS, Kube Secrets and a CD Pipeline For Secure Configuration - Tom Hipwell, Bulb 

Managing configuration doesn't have to be complex, this lightening talk will show a super simple pattern for having configuration live within your repo and deployed to your Kubernetes cluster as a Secret or ConfigMap using a CD pipeline.  This is done using a CLI tool from Mozilla known as SOPS, with an envelope encryption model based on a master key supplied by a cloud based KMS provider such as AWS and a CD pipeline implemented using CircleCI. This pattern keeps your configuration secure, but allows it to be controlled in version control, under code-review and released using your build pipeline.
