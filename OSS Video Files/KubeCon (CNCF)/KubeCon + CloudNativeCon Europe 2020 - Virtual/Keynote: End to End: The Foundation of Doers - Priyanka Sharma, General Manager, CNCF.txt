first working on the open tracing

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,240
project as a contributor

when i started

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,879
working the whole world had changed

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,840
there was a pandemic raging across the

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,920
world

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
race relations in the us was at an

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,199
all-time low

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,199
there were cracks deepening into

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,480
fissures everywhere

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:03,680
great timing indeed well

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,560
you know jokes aside i actually do think

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,600
it's a great time to join cncf

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,760
from the day i got involved to now

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,799
the cloud native ecosystem has become

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,000
the leader

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,880
of end user driven open source backed by

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,119
a foundation of doers builders

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,280
architects enablers

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,320
all these people coming together and it

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,560
has seen

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,880
unprecedented success cncf success

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,000
builds on the larger trend of open

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,799
source

00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,400
25 years ago open source was a sideshow

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,479
with the bold idea

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,000
that open collaboration could drive

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,520
innovation better

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,799
than closed proprietary siloed companies

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,360
today it is the show at the forefront of

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,200
change

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,720
with participation from companies and

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,759
organizations around the world

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
as this whole journey has unfolded i

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
really believe

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,840
open source was built for now for the

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,360
problems of today

00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
our lives have gone remote our

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,080
challenges have gone global

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
we need innovation from anywhere and

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,000
everywhere

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,800
not only to fight with this pandemic but

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,760
to enable

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,200
our companies governments communities

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,840
entire economies

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,560
to come out stronger than ever more

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,239
nimble

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,959
more open more inclusive and therefore

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,280
more effective the cncf ecosystem with

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,080
its

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,280
rich diversity of end users contributors

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
and enablers

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,519
is a demonstration of this success in

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,319
the new world order

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
the doers are the stars of the show and

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,480
cncf exists

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,080
to make their lives better it exists to

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,040
enable end users to build

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,480
modern resilient technologies our

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,440
efforts are validated

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,680
by the 50 plus projects that are in the

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,959
foundation

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,599

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,560
i know there will be many more this

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,600
beautiful cncf community is built by the

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,120
hard work of

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,639
many doers when we think of a doer

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,520
there are some efforts that are very

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,919
obvious and visible such as those of our

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,919
project maintainers contributors the toc

00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:05,220
our end users are movers and shakers in

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,280
the world and are also very recognized

00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:11,919
[Music]

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,039
and then there are many we don't hear

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,000
about as often

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,880
but who deserve a round of applause or

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
in this case

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,400
an explosion of chat emojis

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,800
these are the documentation writers the

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,320
event organizers the storytellers the

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,680
educators

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,240
board members foundation staff

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,479
speaking of foundation staff i'd like to

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,199
especially call out dan khan

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,039
he worked tirelessly for the last four

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,600
years as executive director

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,680
to build this amazing community that we

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,890
are all part of today

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,440
thank you dad

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,919
[Music]

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,880
the result of everyone's hard work is

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,080
the cncf

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
brand of excellence which is end user

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,520
driven open source

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
powered by this diverse community of

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,120
doers

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,960
the collaboration across disciplines

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,000
companies geographies

00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,440
has created a self-sustaining ecosystem

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,639
we have a virtuous cycle of end users

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,520
project creators and enhancers building

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,919
and using cloud native tech with the

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,360
proliferation of cloud native

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,600
and users are increasingly more

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,120
sophisticated they're providing feedback

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
to projects on their needs

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,319
and they're building alongside them

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,400
vendors

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,199
are then able to enhance the ecosystem

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,000
with offerings on top

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,400
as time has gone by the lines between

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,479
these categories has gone blurry

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,600
with end users becoming contributors as

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,199
you saw

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,600
and vendors becoming end users

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,680
what that means is that our empathy for

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,680
each other is increasing every single

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,400
day

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
this virtuous cycle of cloud native is

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,319
powered by some key features of our

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
ecosystem

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,319
cncf is synonymous with trustworthy

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,560
governance

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,759
our projects are a safe space for

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,960
contribution

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,960
backed by a neutral ip zone

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,880
the inclusive and open governance

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,960
ensures diverse contributions are

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,960
accepted and encouraged

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,360
we didn't get to 97 000 contributors and

00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:21,440
177 countries just like that

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,039
the long-standing conformance programs

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,080
and trademark management

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,240
have given end users the confidence to

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,720
use the technologies without fear

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,039
all this achievement and hard work has

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,240
set us up for the next era of cloud

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,840
native

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,840
let's talk about the trends we will see

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,240
with the world ablaze in a metaphorical

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,840
fire it has turned to technology

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,360
to survive in light of the pandemic

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,680
more and more workflows are moving

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,039
online more and more information is

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,160
accessed online

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,160
entertainment is also happening online

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,280
and what that means is that the world

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,199
needs just that much more compute power

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,960
and with that comes the need for

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,440
technologies built on cloud native

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,360
principles

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,680
as the reliance on these technologies

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,039
grows security needs are getting more

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,639
complex

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,360
enter devsecops devsecops does for

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,440
security what devops did for operators

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,560
shift it left to bake it into the

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:26,800
application developer's workflow

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,599
xero trust security practices are also

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,960
on the rise

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:33,279
and our own spiffy project is useful as

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,839
a secure production identity framework

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,519
for everybody

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,000
just like the world of software is

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,360
changing the world of devices is

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,320
changing as well

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,880
there's a proliferation of edge and iot

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,040
devices

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,200
there are cell phones in every hand and

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,680
5g is on the way

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,080
smart machines are getting more and more

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,600
popular whether it's smart trucks cars

00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:00,720
desks fridges ovens you name it

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,200
kubernetes is here to support that move

00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,000
our projects such as k3s and cube edge

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,519
are designed exactly for this future

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,760
and we're working very closely with

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
telcos to ensure that cloud native can

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
support them

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,000
in their move to 5g

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,959
along with all these technology trends i

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
believe that the cultural wave of end

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,560
user driven open source

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,480
will continue to gain steam over the

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,320
next few years

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,680
at the forefront of change and online

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,680
consumption patterns

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,760
these end user companies will drive

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
innovation and continue to enable

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,680
excellence in cloud new

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,240
native cncf specifically has a few plans

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
to

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,240
enable this future we're doing a lot of

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,480
boring work

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,839
building structure processes to do our

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
job efficiently

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,360
our next step will be to document

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,839
everything

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,040
cncf is also very uniquely positioned in

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
this industry

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,600
it can bolster cross-company

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,360
collaboration and interoperability

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,519
with our neutral ip zone and rich

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
contributor programs we plan to do just

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
that

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,040
we will support the doers the builders

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
the architects the enablers

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,240
in creating the technology that will

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,160
define the future

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,000
by supporting and advancing their

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
careers

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,320
it is part of our responsibility to

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,079
ensure that the talent needed for the

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,079
shift to cloud native continues to

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,760
develop

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,880
community enables learning while we all

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
are craving on

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,000
in-person kubecons i believe online

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
events this year will bring attendees

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
from a much richer cross-section of

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,760
society

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,680
folks who couldn't attend before who

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,120
couldn't afford to travel because of

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,720
course family health can all attend

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,160
i know there's many of you listening to

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,640
this right now

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:52,000
in the future there will always be a

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,399
virtual component to our events

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,800
for folks interested in open source our

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,800
diversity scholarships are ongoing

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,399
we offer internships to students to work

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,200
on our projects

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,720
and last but not least our training

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,839
programs provide courses and

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,640
certifications

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,600
to take careers to the next level

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,600
already

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,800
15 000 developers have taken advantage

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,560
of our certified kubernetes admin and

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,399
certified kubernetes application

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,399
developer certification offerings

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,560
as we embark on this journey there will

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,279
be challenges

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,440
i'm here to tell you things like covered

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,560
unrest destructive forces

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,720
they will not break us open source

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,600
we will help beat corona with a

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,360
competitive rush as is happening today

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,560
with linux foundation public health and

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,120
contact racing

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,079
with changing racially charged language

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,760
inside code

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,320
and with outside the foundation with

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,519
vaccines the work is ongoing and the

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,680
road is long but we will fight on

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,560
what we need from each other today is a

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,079
commitment

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
a commitment to cloud native a

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,120
commitment to open source

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,560
be here stay with us big giants and

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,440
small upstarts

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,399
all working on solutions together open

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
source development

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,519
enables exactly the kind of innovation

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
where the best

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,720
ideas win no matter where they come from

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,279
as we witnessed with the growth of open

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,920
source a community of excellence will

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,200
always be stronger than a silo of power

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,079
silos topple

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,399
communities are resilient distributed

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,600
and

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,600
constantly evolving

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,120
i am so thrilled i had the opportunity

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,120
to speak with you today

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,720
our collective strength is as a

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,000
foundation of doers

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,560
and everybody has a role your job

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,800

[Music]

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
the success of technologies lies in the

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,639
constant iteration

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,920
and the passion for your end users

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,639
success

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,760
that's what we built here at cncf we are

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,120
the champions

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,279
of end user driven open source

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
and let me tell you people this is just

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,920
the beginning

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,000
