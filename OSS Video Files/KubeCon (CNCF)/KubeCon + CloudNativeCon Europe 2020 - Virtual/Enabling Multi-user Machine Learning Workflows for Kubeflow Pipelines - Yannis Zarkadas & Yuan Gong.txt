Enabling Multi-user Machine Learning Workflows for Kubeflow Pipelines - Yannis Zarkadas, Arrikto & Yuan Gong, Google 

Kubeflow is an open source machine learning platform built on Kubernetes. Every service in Kubeflow is implemented either as a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) (e.g., TensorFlow Job) or as a standalone service (e.g., Kubeflow Pipelines).  As enterprises start to adopt Kubeflow, the need for access control, authentication, and authorization is emerging. Kubernetes CRDs come with their own auth story, but what about Services with their own API and database, like Kubeflow Pipelines? In this talk, we explore how we enabled multi-user workflows for Kubeflow Pipelines, in a Kubernetes-native way.  We present how we combined open-source, cloud-native technologies to design and implement a flexible, Kubernetes-native solution for services with their own API and database. The talk will include a live demo.
