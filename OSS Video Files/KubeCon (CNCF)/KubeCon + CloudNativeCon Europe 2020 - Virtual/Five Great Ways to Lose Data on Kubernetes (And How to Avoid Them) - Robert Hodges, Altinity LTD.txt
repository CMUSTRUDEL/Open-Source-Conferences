Five Great Ways to Lose Data on Kubernetes (And How to Avoid Them) - Robert Hodges, Altinity LTD 

Databases and stateful apps are gravitating rapidly to Kubernetes, so the sorrows of accidental data loss cannot be far behind. As long-time database engineers and authors of the ClickHouse Kubernetes operator, our team has seen lots of imaginative ways to lose data. We also learned how to prevent them.  The talk starts with standard high availability/disaster recovery models used in DBMS and demonstrates that classic ways to lose data are still alive and well on Kubernetes. We'll then pivot to Kubernetes-specific disasters-in-waiting, such as the PV that wasn't, affinity afflictions, and the dreaded fat fingers of fate. The talk will help instill a healthy sense of paranoia and give listeners tools to ensure their experiences with cloud-native data will be happy ones.
