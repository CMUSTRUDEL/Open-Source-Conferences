Notary v2 Introduction and Status Report - Justin Cormack, Docker & Omar Paul, Amazon 

The Notary v2 project is a rework of the infrastructure for container signing, supporting additional OCI Artifacts, such as Helm, Singularity and CNAB. It addresses the design and usability issues that have been found with Notary v1, and signing in a multi-registry world. The major focus being signatures as first class elements of registries rather than running a sidecar database. It addresses the signing usability issues enabling broad provider and customer adoption. This session will give an overview of the Notary v2 community project at present, and the roadmap. This session is for anyone interested in container signing and what the new project is working on.
