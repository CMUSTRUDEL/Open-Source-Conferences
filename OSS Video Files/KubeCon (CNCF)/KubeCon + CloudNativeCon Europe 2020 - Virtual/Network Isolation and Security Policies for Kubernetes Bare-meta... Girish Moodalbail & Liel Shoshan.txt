Network Isolation and Security Policies for Kubernetes Bare-metal Nodes - Girish Moodalbail, NVIDIA & Liel Shoshan, Mellanox 

Running Kubernetes at scale in a multi-tenant Cloud requires strong network isolation and flexible stateful security policy enforcement for the bare-metal nodes used for both the tenant K8s clusters as well as in the Cloud control plane. Such isolation and security needs to be implemented in a way that consumes as little host resources as possible, while being immune to potentially malicious host root user. Additionally, the preferred implementation needs to be compatible with a high-performance (offloaded) K8s CNI. This presentation provides an overview of such an implementation for Software Defined (SDN) K8s node networking, based on Open Virtual Network (OVN) and Open vSwitch (OVS)) and offloaded to “bump-in-the-wire” Smart NICs.
