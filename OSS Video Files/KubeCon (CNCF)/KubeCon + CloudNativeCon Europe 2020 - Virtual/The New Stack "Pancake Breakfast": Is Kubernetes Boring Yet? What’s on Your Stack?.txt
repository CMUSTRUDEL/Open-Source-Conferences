The conferences feature presentations from developers and end users of Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and all of the other CNCF-hosted projects.  

The New Stack "Pancake Breakfast": Is Kubernetes Boring Yet? What’s on Your Stack? 

Kubernetes is boring and that’s a good thing. It’s what’s on top of Kubernetes that counts. So join us for a short stack with The New Stack as we ask: “What’s on your stack?” We’ll pass the virtual syrup, and talk about all that goes with Kubernetes. It may be stateless, but that also means there’s plenty of room for sides.

patrick mcfadden chief evangelist for

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,680
apache cassandra datastax

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,960
morning alex so here we are i came here

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,719
pancakes but i'm staying for the

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,120
kubernetes that's right

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,719
all right and bills hey jack regional

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,600
director of solutions engineering at

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,880

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,520
hey bill good morning hello everyone

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,080
hey i got my pancakes here can somebody

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,439
pass me the syrup or butter or anything

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,360
that you might have over there

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,680
oh thank you thank you patrick oh

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,560
thanks for the butter got the coffee

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
toppings

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,080
yeah nice job i'm gonna start with the

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,080
syrup here and put them on my pancakes

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
i think one of the things i wanted to do

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,640
is just let's just share a little

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,240
let's a little share a little amsterdam

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,640
here

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,040
uh look at those pancakes so that's from

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,079
a restaurant in amsterdam

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,600
oh good old amsterdam uh what a

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,280
wonderful place it is

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
is this supposed to be a tease because i

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,280
really wanted to be there

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,159
i know i think it is it feels like that

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,680
doesn't it

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,439
so in any case i want to just thank you

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
all again for being here and our

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,360
discussion

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,880
really is about is kubernetes boring yet

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:09,280
and i want to ask that question you know

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,120
and specifically what's on your stack

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,319
we're talking pancakes here we might as

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,959
well talk about

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,440
technology stacks and one of the things

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,040
that we

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,040
are seeing is it's what's on top of

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,000
kubernetes that counts

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,520
infrastructure is almost becoming boring

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
as some people would say

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,040
craig mcluckie calls it a natural

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,160
substrate

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,959
that is just becoming part of

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,599
what we do kelsey hightower would say

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,120
that the

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
that the plumbing works now it's

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,840
important what's on top of it

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,440
so that's the question i really want to

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,040
ask today

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,080
and priyanka maybe i can start with you

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,280
you know is kubernetes boring yeah is

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,680
is the plumbing working is is the stack

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,200
there for people and you know what are

00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,920
the different types of stacks that

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,760
you're seeing

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,080
people develop yes absolutely

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,480
i think kubernetes is getting close to

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,879
boring and we are very proud of that

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
it's a good thing it's solid and mature

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,560
and that's

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
equivalent to boring and i say kudos to

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,200
the community and ecosystem for getting

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
there

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
i think the in all seriousness this is

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,920
not something to underestimate just

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
because

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
of all the hard work that goes into

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,400
making something stable

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,799
and reliable i think though while

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,080
the core technology itself might be

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,239
approaching boring

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
i don't think that's the case for all

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,400
the surrounding

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,519
ecosystem around it if you think

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,080
specifically let's say

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,879
carrier networking there's a tremendous

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,720
opportunity

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,000
for telecoms to modernize their

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
infrastructure needs

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,599
and reduce operating costs and that's

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,200
something there's a lot of work going on

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,080
with uh like conjunction of cncf

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,120
and linux foundation networking in which

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
lots of uh

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
telcos are involved so that's an area

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,319
where i see a lot of interesting

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,959
happening soon

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,680
uh currently happening and continuing to

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,599
evolve

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,760
i think those use cases will become more

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,959
and more popular people will see that

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,640
um additionally i think by using

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,160
kubernetes you come up

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,639
with uh new challenges as um

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,240
as a as a software company as a

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,240
engineering organization

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,639
and that space i think is still there's

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,639
a lot of innovation happening i mean

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,000
i think very recently it's kind of

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,759
become clear that it's

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,320
that service meshes are very important

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,720
and it's going to be a multi-mesh world

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,400
so that's awesome we want to support

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
multiple service meshes bloom

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
and standardize and do the best things

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,000
for their end users so

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
i think there's a lot of interesting

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,440
coming soon uh with the

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,560
uh foundation of boring kubernetes which

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
is exactly how it should be

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
honey i'd like to ask you this question

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,240
priyanka was just talking about service

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,280
match which is an interesting topic

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,720
these days

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,400
she's talking about the support of

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
multiple service meshes and she's

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,080
talking a lot about i think

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
what comes down to participation in the

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,360
community and who actually is

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
represented and how they get

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,440
represented properly which plays a big

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,560
part in developer experiences which

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
plays a big part

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,639
in the actual technology architectures

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,000
themselves so johnny

00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,840
what's your thought on the architectures

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,280
of today and the plumbing itself and

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
what's being built on top

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,360
are we ready to really build on top and

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,639
and how do these community plays uh

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,759
play a role absolutely

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,560
so service mesh is becoming the

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
foundation

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
for exposing a lot of developer

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,720
experience

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,560
whether it is linker d or sto it is

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,320
plugging a very important gap in the in

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,199
the kubernetes stack

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,280
particularly by bringing in the the

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
security the secure communication across

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,800
microservices

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,080
the network policies and also

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,759
observability

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,600
and then once we have the service mesh

00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,199
infrastructure on top of the core

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,840
kubernetes foundation

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,199
that opens up additional developer

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,039
experience and it is also becoming the

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
foundation for serverless

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,080
for example if you if you look at k

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,520
native uh

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,759
k native is built on top of istio and

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,919
uh that is actually delivering the

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
serverless and even driven execution on

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,759
top of kubernetes

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,120
so uh in terms of innovation

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,880
we are going to see a lot of

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,360
advancements when it comes to service

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,520
mesh

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,880
now whether it is multi-cluster

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,880
federated service mesh

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,080
hybrid service mesh which will cut

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,400
across on-prem

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,680
public cloud and hybrid cloud it is

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,840
going to be a very very important

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,280
technology and it is also the foundation

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,880
for the

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,520
developer experience on top of

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,520
kubernetes

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,160
i'd like to uh just point out that one

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,639
of the key highlights i was making was

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
that

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,120
kubernetes being boring kubernetes being

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
stable enables all this to exist and

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,919
then like it could prove the developer

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,759
experience so

00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,400
the boring is critical for the

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,720
interesting for what it's worth

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,800
well bill i have a question then what's

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,240
not boring

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,759
so anything that's really beyond the

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,840
microservices development inside of

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,400
kubernetes is really fascinating to me

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,840
so

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,199
a lot of the team has already talked

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
about things like functions running

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,000
inside of kubernetes but then the

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,599
service meshes as well as

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
simplifying the deployment and

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,720
automating a lot of these other

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,759
processes and procedures that need to be

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,520
able to be

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,759
deployed inside of these environments in

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,120
order for management to be able to be

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,199
maintained

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
there's life cycle management solutions

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,319
and testing solutions and all these

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
other different types of components

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
that it's not boring it's there's so

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,400
much different areas that groups can

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,240
really even focus but still contribute

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,160
to whatever they're really interested in

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,160
as well patrick and transitioning here

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
into this larger discussion when we

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
start to look at

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,360
you know the actual deployments out

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,280
there one of the things that we found in

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,160
our research and it's in our ebook that

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,240
we're publishing

00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,479
in the next week or two about kubernetes

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,080
is really the second edition of it

00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,080
a little shameless plug there

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,960
download now

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,400
we uh we were finding that the

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,560
deployments with more than five clusters

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:15,599
have continued to rise

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,240
but mostly among larger companies

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,240
and i'm curious what this says to you

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,879
about the trajectory of growth and

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,039
adoption for kubernetes

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,039
and you know there's there's projects

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,120
here that i think speak to that but

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,199
perhaps you have some thoughts there on

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,320
on the actual growth and adoption

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,320
of kubernetes as it relates to clusters

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,279
yeah i mean when it comes to application

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,360
infrastructure um kubernetes is

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,279
clearly establishing itself as like this

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,839
is the way to do it and across clouds

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,880
on-prem

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,200
wherever you are um i think there's

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,560
to kind of go back to this is it boring

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
yet no it's actually

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,120
super exciting right now we're at the

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,519
end of the beginning um kubernetes

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,040
uh as it grew you know and this is just

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,320
me as an infrastructure guy

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,120
um i think it's replaced the app server

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,279
and um so you see that deployment you're

00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,000
not going to see deployments of

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,320
jboss and websphere you're going to see

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,279
deployments of kubernetes and

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
um what's really interesting now is and

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
i

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:19,120
and you know that i work quite a bit in

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,040
this um with there's just like

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,720
communities popping up around data in

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,720
kubernetes and

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,800
that's the missing link right now um i

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
just did a talk this week about is

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,680
kubernetes ready for data

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,120
and spoiler alert no it's not um it's

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,320
built for applications

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,839
and um you see that growth happening on

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,480
the applications here we're dumping

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,279
things like

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,120
um running scripts like i hate to say it

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,720
that things like chef and terraform are

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
now going away

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,399
i love those tools but you know they're

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,399
they're starting to go away service mesh

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,200
is becoming more the standard

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
but that growth in clusters is really um

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
on the applications here on the

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,160
application tier

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,839
what are the issues that people are

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,839
facing that is

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,320
causing the that is leading to

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,160
improvements in the technology

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,640
and craig mcclucky again brought this up

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,959
in a podcast we did and he said

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,560
that it's it's not necessarily the

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,640
innovation of the individual it's the

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,160
problems that they're facing

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,560
and the problems that they face lead to

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,160
that need those new improvements what

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,920
are the problems that we're seeing for

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,560
instance in the data plane

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,040
that are leading to new improvements

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
sure

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,360
so alex uh can i can i address the first

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,680
one as well

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
enterprises using beyond five clusters

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,519
and then i'll come back to the data

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,959
plane

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:39,200
so um you know a decade ago

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,000
uh the the entire industry was talking

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
about

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,839
what was called as vm sprawl you know

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,120
remember when vmworld

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,800
when vmware was very popular or getting

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,240
popular among enterprises and it was

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,880
extremely easy to launch

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,560
a vm everyone went ahead and launched

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,959
their own virtual machine

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,640
and a lot of vms were lucking around in

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,800
the enterprise data center

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,079
and it was very difficult for enterprise

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,600
i.t to

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,920
to take control and to basically do a

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
stock check on where the vms are running

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,959
how many vms are running and whether

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,480
they are compliant or not

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:17,600
now fast forward to 2020 kubernetes

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,120
is experiencing a similar cluster sprawl

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,800
today it is extremely easy for

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,440
developers to push a button and

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,399
deploy a kubernetes cluster so whether

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,240
it is managed

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,000
kubernetes service running in the cloud

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,519
or a mini cube running on developers

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,519
laptop or more miniature versions of

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,519
kubernetes like kind and k3s

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
there is kubernetes everywhere and that

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,760
is actually

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,920
resulting in a cluster sprawl and again

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,839
enterprise iit is concerned that they

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,399
have absolutely no control

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,160
over uh the cluster sprawl you know they

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,720
they are not able to basically

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,240
enforce and impose certain policies that

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,440
are absolutely critical

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,440
for enterprises so

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,560
uh there are two parallel streams that

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,839
are actually uh

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,760
taking place one the uh industry has

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,839
started to realize that

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
just the control plane that is managing

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,839
kubernetes is not

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,959
not enough uh to take care of the

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,440
cluster sprawl

00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,360
so in the last one year we have seen the

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,519
meta control plane emerge

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,200
and this meta control plane is the

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,760
control plane of control planes

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,040
right uh google was the first to come

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,519
out with anthus

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,200
and the code premise of anthony says you

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,720
run a kubernetes cluster anywhere

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,000
we'll manage it from gcp's control plane

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,480
then followed vmware uh you know with

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,600
with hto acquisition and peak pivotal

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,399
coming to

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,320
vmware uh they actually launched a tanzo

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,519
mission control and tanzus promise is

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,120
exactly the same

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,360
we don't care where you run your cluster

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,040
we don't care which flavor of cluster

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,000
kubernetes cluster we are running but we

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:55,600
will take care of the meta control plane

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,200
and then came azure arc uh and then ibm

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,880
multi-cloud manager which is now

00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,600
rebranded as red hat advanced cluster

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,279
manager

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,000
and then we have rancher which is an

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,560
open source and now a part of souza so

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,480
it's it's a very interesting trend that

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,279
we are seeing in the in the industry

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,959
where uh you know days are gone when we

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,560
are talking about managing the set of

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,800
machines through an orchestrator which

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,600
is the kubernetes control plane but now

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,079
there is a sprawl of clusters and we

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,639
actually

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,079
need a new meta layer to manage these

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,839
clusters and that's where

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,639
there is a very interesting trend and

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,480
this is going to enable enterprises to

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,160
enforce policies irrespective of where

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,560
the clusters are running

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,360
that is on the commercial vendor side

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,000
now the cluster

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,480
api the the actual sig that is working

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,399
on

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,560
managing the life cycle of kubernetes

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,120
clusters from an existing kubernetes

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,760
cluster

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,680
is picking up a lot of momentum so we'll

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,240
actually see how a kubernetes cluster

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,959
can

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,040
spawn a child cluster and manage the

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,160
entire life cycle just the way you do it

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,000
with a pod

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,279
so these two trends are going to be

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,079
significantly

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,680
important for the future of kubernetes

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,639
the meta control plane the commercial

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,040
implementation

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,720
and then the cluster api uh which is

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,399
going to manage the life cycle of

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,639
kubernetes clusters and and this is

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,959
going to put uh

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,120
some kind of you know the the uh method

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,680
to madness when it comes to managing

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,040
uh dozens of kubernetes clusters so that

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,160
is a very very important trend that i

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,519
want to call out

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,839
priyanka here hear

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,839
what johnny said so thank you for that

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,320
very articulate description i think

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,839
you're extremely exactly spot on that

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,920
this is the new trend and

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,519
it's based on as alex was asking what

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
are the problems people are facing which

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,000
is there's clusters fall there's so much

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,720
going on

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,079
um i would like to say like in general

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,000
like you know going back to the original

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,839
conversation of it's like you know

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
it's like some people have more more

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,839
than five clusters on the rise etc

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,920
it's like there's no right size cluster

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,320
for anyone i mean you can easily have

00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,079
around

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,600
a thousand nodes per cluster and like

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,720
that's fine for certain companies of

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,839
certain size

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,240
um but the real issue as was johnny was

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,000
saying

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
was that people have to manage you know

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,720
they have various deployments in various

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,560
clouds

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,040
and having a better control plane that

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,360
takes care of it is what helps people

00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,120
i think um and the cluster api is also

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,600
like supporting that whole thing

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,760
the key i think that tells us is that

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,240
the multi-cloud world

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,880
is the reality it's here to stay and

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,800
that's

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,240
a lot of innovation not just in the

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,320
cluster management but

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,240
otherwise is going to happen with that

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,279
in mind how can we help

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,240
enterprises uh end users big or small be

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,320
able to

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,759
go wherever the workloads are swap

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,839
around workloads easily

00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,600
the portability is going to be on

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,199
everybody top of mind for everyone

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,519
because

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,320
it's unlikely that someone will stick to

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,800
one

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
cloud provider or bare metal or anything

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
across

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,160
a vast amount of applications and

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,800
products

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,440
bill i'm curious in your thoughts here

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,399
about

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
about that role uh that we have now with

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,880
clusters and

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,480
and especially because you were talking

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,959
earlier about automation and

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,240
yeah for automation yeah and it's it's

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,120
interesting to see a lot of large

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,800
organizations

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,320
have multiple clusters and some of the

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,839
reasons are more technical and some of

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,440
them are more political

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,440
the technical reasons high availability

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,399
scalability requirements geographical

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,000
requirements

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,120
all make sense but a lot of

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,160
organizations have multiple

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
modernization

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,160
projects going on internally but every

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,680
single core of those modernization

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,800
projects is based on kubernetes which

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
just speaks to

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,920
the breadth and scope of what the

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,560
platform can ultimately do as well

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,959
so it's everyone is betting on one horse

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,320
just

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,680
changing it a little bit differently and

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,000
tweaking it a little bit differently to

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:40,880
their specific use case

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,320
um uh patrick one of the questions i

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
have is about what

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,680
johnny was referring to he calls these

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,440
these these man you know these new

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,360
management platforms

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,959
these these kubernetes management

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,839
platforms that are emerging such as

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,240
anthos

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,440
i've heard them described as moms

00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:00,639
management on management platforms

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:04,480
and it also speaks then to one of the

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,520
the questions that i hear a lot

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,640
um these days is about what is then

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,880
the role of the platform operator what

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,959
are the roles of the people who are

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
you know who are who are not just the

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,240
developers who are

00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,319
you know just want to just all they want

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,600
to do is code that that's just kind of

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:23,760
their interest

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,880
there's also this camp of power users

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,319
out there who

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,400
want to know about the infrastructure

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,720
they want to know what's underneath

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,480
and uh but they still need help as well

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,559
you know and they still need these ways

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,440
to manage the arc manage their

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
their their clusters and we're seeing

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,760
you know

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,960
for instance a datasack you're building

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,480
out um

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,360
uh operators and so i'm wondering how

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,919
you piece this

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,840
you know piece these pieces together

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,880
when you're thinking about

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,240
the overall management of these clusters

00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:00,080
in the sprawl that

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,760
you know that we're referring to here

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
i mean they and it's interesting you

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,400
know that the moms uh

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
yes then that points to i think a real i

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,200
think

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,480
something that can be addressed inside

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,880
of the kubernetes project

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,320
where you know there's a usability gap

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,000
um as soon as you see

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,360
operators of operators you know that's

00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,679
one of the things that uh

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,039
we're trying to work through especially

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,720
when it comes to storage

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,559
and data and things like that you know

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,280
you you have all these dependency

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,160
management

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,880
so um and that could be a real potential

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,880
um

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,559
pitfall for the project is when it

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,880
becomes over

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,919
over stressed and it becomes impossible

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,480
to work with

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,480
um i mean for sure services service

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,240
companies such as the googles and the

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,039
amazons and the microsoft's are going to

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,000
try to make

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,919
that experience a lot easier but um you

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,480
know there's i think there's

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,520
a lot of operators out there that are

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,240
looking for to

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,400
reduce the toil and i hear that word a

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,440
lot reduce the toil and

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,720
we could do i think a better job of

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,440
how we make kubernetes approachable to

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,880
mere mortals you don't have to have 10

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,280
years of experience running

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,160
infrastructure to do it but operators

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,760
are going that way

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,000
there's some cool projects that are

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,280
trying to make it even easier like kudo

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,400
um and the coup builder which is um

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,919
an interesting project as well you know

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,000
all of these projects that are happening

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,679
are trying to make that a little

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,720
more for mortals i would say you know

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,360
people that are just trying to get

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,320
infrastructure out there let's get to it

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,840
you know people don't want to run

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,280
kubernetes to run kubernetes they want

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,240
to run kubernetes to deploy an

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,280
application

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,760
to extract value from their company

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,440
priyanka i know you'd like to say

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,919
something i'd also like to ask you as

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
well

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:47,120
about you know one of the things that we

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,720
are seeing and johnny can attest to this

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,840
maybe he can follow up and then we'll go

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,640
back to bill again

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:57,039
is we have these third-party providers

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
who were building on open source

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,320
and then you have the managed service

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,400
providers such as the googles and the

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,880
awss of the world

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,000
but the the the googles and the

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,400
databases of the world

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,440
may be more plain vanilla right than

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,679
than what

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,840
than what uh the third party provider

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,679
offers because of their you know their

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,919
their specific kind of focus on a

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,080
particular open source technology

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,840
so how does that play into the the

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,840
equation here and the factors that we're

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,480
seeing with this overall experience that

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,559
really is going to be critical yes

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,080
absolutely i'm actually very happy that

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,400
that's the case that you have

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,159
the cloud providers providing at least

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,320
the base level that's needed with the

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,280
managed solutions for kubernetes so you

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,799
know you have

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,360
gke and uh aka

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,159
and like you know eks all of that stuff

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,320
so it's

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,360
that's really good and then there's the

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,679
more specific

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,400
uh solutions out there for very various

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,880
reasons

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,640
i think at the end of the day as long as

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
kubernetes is getting in the hands of

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,080
developers

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,039
we're good i i used to work at gitlab

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,280
before and they were

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,760
doing an excellent job of it but just by

00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,400
just connecting the developer experience

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,840
into a whole devops experience and this

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,280
is not me trying to make a plug for a

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,679
certain company but rather

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,200
i appreciate that mindset where you know

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,159
in this whole conversation we've been

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,280
talking about

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,720
mere mortals that's all of us you know

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,360
and that includes

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,559
um devops professionals that includes

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,000
application developers

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,960
platform engineering there's so many

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,360
names for teams too you know

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,440
at the end of the day some tooling that

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:34,000
connects the dots across these various

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:37,200
job profiles and experiences

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
is successful and luckily we see all

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,039
that happening

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,640
in combination with the managed provider

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,280
managed services from the cloud

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,880
providers so i'd really think we are on

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,480
a good trajectory

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,799
for um end users of all job titles to

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,000
get

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,000
more and more comfortable with

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,159
kubernetes um

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,559
in addition to tooling there's also an

00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,280
aspect of learning you know learning and

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,320
training

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,440
and something we see a lot at cncf is

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,400
the big excitement that people have for

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,600
our certified

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,760
uh kubernetes admin certified kubernetes

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,280
application developer exams people are

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,640
studying hard there's like

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:20,559
i think 5 000 um c ads

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,520
and 10 000 uh cka is already in

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,280
existence and

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,679
the rates are doubling especially you

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,880
know actually in the current world of

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,360
everybody at home uh that there's been a

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,880
great

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,559
kind of um momentum towards learning

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,360
more and understanding so

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:39,360
i think this is just this is just i

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,200
would say a little after the beginning

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,240
uh and more and more education more and

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,880
more simplification combined together

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,440
is going to produce the ongoing results

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
that we're

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,760
starting to see johnny before we get

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,760
started with you i do want to just say

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,240
to all the people watching this that you

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,000
will have the opportunity to ask

00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,559
questions at the end and so they will

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,240
have

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,400
10 minutes for questions at the end of

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
this discussion johnny i'm curious in

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,600
your thoughts about that experience

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,080
overall

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,520
sure so uh there are there are two

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,720
things alex that i want to bring up

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,799
one is kubernetes has brought everyone

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,559
to the same level playing field

00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:21,200
uh you know five years ago six years ago

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,480
scale was confined to hyperscale

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,000
infrastructure providers

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,880
you know gcp aws azure

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,080
but today kubernetes has brought

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,919
hyperscale

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,679
possible and it has actually brought

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,760
that into enterprise data center and and

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,760
what it actually opened up is

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,600
additional opportunities to replicate

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,919
managed services that are exclusively

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,440
offered by public cloud providers

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,919
in the kubernetes ecosystem and i want

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,039
to call out two specific examples here

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,720
one is the whitis project

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:56,080
now which is actually a cnc of project

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,200
and that brings up

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,320
um so that actually brings up the

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,039
ability to run

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,159
a highly scalable highly available

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,000
managed database

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,400
like offering on top of kubernetes

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,960
cluster and in fact

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,640
the the core committers and founders of

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,559
waiters have now built a commercial

00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,000
offering called planet scale db

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:21,279
and planet scale db delivers rds

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,080
in amazon rds or azure sql like

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,600
reliability and scale just on kubernetes

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,760
that is one example

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,200
and then we have data stacks now which

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,919
actually build a commercial

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,360
operator and a completely supported

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,400
commercial model of

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,480
cassandra on top of kubernetes and what

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,360
it actually brings is a very

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,200
uh scalable highly distributed database

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,679
something on the lines of amazon aurora

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,320
multi

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,039
multi master or cloud spanner from

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,320
google

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,039
or cosmos db like capabilities just

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,760
using

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,440
kubernetes cluster and open source

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,559
databases and commercial operators and

00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,720
commercial support

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,000
so you know kubernetes has become the

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
level playing field to

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,279
bring in additional capabilities that

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,120
were otherwise confined to

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,799
just managed service providers and

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,200
hyperscale providers

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,320
uh two examples that i i wanted to call

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,559
out

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,720
yes patrick just texted to me a

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,640
truckload of pancakes just showed up

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,919
and created a little bit of back noise

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,760
here so i

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:25,520
did go on mute there for a second um but

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,640
the uh the questions that i think are

00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,080
coming up more

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,760
too is you know johnny talks a lot about

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:35,039
this and i'd like to ask

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,799
as bill um there's this there's this

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,559
interesting kind

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:44,159
scenario developing where we

00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,960
have historically relied on platform as

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,600
a service technologies in the past to

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,480
use for

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,240
for developers but now we're moving more

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,240
into components and

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,000
you know containers as the services are

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,320
emerging and i think that's what

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,640
johnny is talking about with these

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,080
management platforms

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,159
but now you have this issue of

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,080
configurators and like you know who

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,400
actually does the configurations

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,760
is it the developer is it the operations

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,440
person

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,520
and then on top of that then you have

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,840
all the policy issues that come into

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,159
play like who manages the clusters so

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,400
like

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:23,520
mulch so there's a so there's some um

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,080
authentication for instance uh that that

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,320
can

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,120
that is uh critical if you're gonna have

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,559
any kind of really secure environment

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,760
so uh you know bill when you're thinking

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,679
about through all those

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,279
you know types of issues what are the

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,919
what are the top challenges

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
that that you see you know what are like

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,840
what are the

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,000
what are the things that are on your

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,919
mind a lot well i think it's

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,840
what is the overall purpose of what this

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,279
platform is supposed to provide and most

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,120
organizations have some sort of

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,279
initiative to get time back to the

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,520
developer have them just focus on

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,720
creating custom services custom logic

00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,440
that's going to move their business

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,200
forward

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
so anything that can be done in more of

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,840
an automated fashion anything that can

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,919
be taken

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:05,520
out of the picture for them and although

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,360
there is the option of choice how do we

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,559
reduce the choices that

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,840
they're going to have to be concerned

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,120
about how can they ultimately just

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,640
create these services

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,320
that can be put in front of whatever

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,960
business justification that may be as

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,799
well

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,240
so when it's who's responsible for this

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
i think this is why we see such an

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,679
explosion of kubernetes administrators i

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,120
think this is why we see a lot of people

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,480
investing time effort and energy into

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,559
these open source projects

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,080
because it is the underlying pipelines

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,600
that have to be built but when it comes

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,240
to the actual services that have to be

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,000
hosted on

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,600
inside of these platforms we want to

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,880
reduce the amount of time and effort

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,960
that those individuals creating those

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
services need to spend in the underlying

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,520
work as well

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,559
a ka a kubernetes administrator it's

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,200
like

00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,159
we saw like the proliferation of dbs

00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,240
back in the day

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,679
are we going to see the calibrate the

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,080
proliferation of

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,480
kubernetes administrators priyanka i'm

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,679
curious from your perspective are you

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,520
seeing is this kind of just a

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:00,960
the way it's going to have to be if

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,679
we're going to see kubernetes

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,120
being managed throughout an organization

00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,960
and i'm wondering are you seeing any

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,320
companies who are using kubernetes

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,960
throughout their organization

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,080
i mean sure there's some smaller uh

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,080
startups who do

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:18,480
but any larger mid-sized companies

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,200
and and if so or if not you know where

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,640
are they

00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,520
what's their progress yes so to that

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,159
point about

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,919
kubernetes administrators certified

00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,919
kubernetes administrators

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,080
are yeah the certification i know you

00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,320
guys are big on that these days

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,360
well not just us the end users are big

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,240
on it that's the

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,799
thing you know because uh and you know i

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,240
learned about this even before i joined

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,399
uh cncf full time is uh my team

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,520
in the past uh one of them have was a

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,840
cka and

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,279
he was so proud of it and he told me you

00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,200
know it's like it's not just an easy

00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,120
cert you can get online i mean

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,880
you have to study hard there's like you

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,399
know it's not multiple choice you have

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,880
to actually put in answers

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,760
and there's real pride people are taking

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,080
in this

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,039
deepened knowledge because it's very

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,520
meaningful

00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,159
and so i think that's one of the reasons

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,200
that this

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,440
uh certification has really taken off

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,279
um and that it is a trend i think in

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,159
general about kubernetes admins

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,000
absolutely

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,640
i think a lot of people also do this

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,480
these uh exams etc to

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,919
even if they're not gonna be the admin

00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,360
in their company like the person i was

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,159
talking to is not an admin in the

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,480
company

00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,360
he but now having this baseline of

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,760
knowledge

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,240
he is able to you know educate his team

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,520
or you know participate in cool projects

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,960
that may otherwise not have been

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,240
accessible to him so it's

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,159
seen as a job development

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,000
incorrectly so as like you know you're

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,640
enriching your professional career by

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,279
doing these

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,760
uh they're becoming a kubernetes admin

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,919
so

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,039
i think that is a very healthy thing

00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,960
that's happening

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,320
um and i think with more and more of

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,080
such people like popping up

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,760
in different companies you don't have to

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,200
have everyone take those exams or

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,279
everyone becomes certified

00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,640
but the cultures culture becomes very

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,880
kubernetes friendly you

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,080
you know you can tap your uh neighbor

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,880
and ask questions about

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,919
uh all these things so net-net i think

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,960
that trend is

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:14,640
good and it's continuing i think uh

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,480
at least i can speak to what we're doing

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,880
here in cncf

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,240
in partnership with lf training we're

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,279
also working through

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,600
um we just launched the

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,720
security exam certification and security

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,480
for kubernetes

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,559
um and we obviously have the application

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,880
developer one and the reason for these

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,960
coming out is again that

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,039
that need for people to gain that extra

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,919
edge of knowledge as they go about their

00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,159
day-to-day

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,520
not everybody who takes these exams is

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,640
in that full-time role

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,720
and i see that as a really good thing so

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,840
overall i think these are drivers of

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,200
success

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:52,320
for organizations um and then i think

00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,159
your second question

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,919
was what was your second question sorry

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,919
i got so excited about the training

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,200
boy i was gonna i i wanted to actually

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,120
let me think about that i was just like

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,080
i think my mind is too i think my mind's

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,519
on pancakes

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,000
um so i was actually thinking about it

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,880
you know

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,679
more so well let's transition maybe the

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,360
the better question really here is

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,080
you know what are going to be uh

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,200
the challenges that companies are going

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,960
to have to face

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,000
in in scaling up and it seems like

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,080
certification is a big part of it

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,360
i would agree with that certification is

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,960
a big part of it but

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
of course there's many elements when

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,519
your question is what are the challenges

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,880
of scaling up

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,000
that's like a wide landscape to answer

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,000
um but i think as uh

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,080
one of them the panelists are saying

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,760
there's the technology aspect

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,240
of the challenge and then there is the

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,519
political or human side of the challenge

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,240
and i think um when as organizations

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,799
look

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
the the size and culture of a company

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,360
will determine which is

00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,399
you know the bigger challenge at hand so

00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,600
things like this

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,799
cka these certifications really help

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,240
with um bridging the technology gap

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,360
really help with like creating a

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,640
momentum in term

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,080
like at the grassroots level um at the

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,039
same time i think

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,840
it's extremely important for uh the

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,279
leadership

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,960
the technical leadership in these

00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,440
companies to start like you know looking

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,600
at examples talking to other end users

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,720
to just understand what's happened for

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:31,120
other people and

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,159
design their own journey forward

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,120
everybody is truly a special snowflake

00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,880
and and the good news is that with the

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:41,279
kubernetes becoming boring

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
that the the special snowflake part is

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,679
getting less

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,200
and less in like you know there's less

00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,760
less of the experience is going to be

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,360
unique but you have a larger community

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,320
to rely on so what we see

00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,480
in our end user community which um i

00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,600
feel a little braggy but i'll say it is

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,279
uh with 144 members is like the largest

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,080
any foundation open source foundation

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:05,279
enjoys

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,039
we have these end user only um

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,960
meetings and things where people are

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,080
coming together talking about specific

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,120
challenges and

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,679
that i think is invaluable um they have

00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,440
this

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,120
safe space where there are no vendors

00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,120
have nothing against vendors but it's a

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,720
nice safe space for the end users

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,039
and the conversations i hear are

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,039
increasingly more complex

00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,399
from the time i joined cloud native in

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,640
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,320
as a part of the open tracing project to

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,640
now in 2020

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,960
people have moved leaps and bounds and

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,360
that's a testament to their commitment

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,640
to build better software faster and more

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,039
reliably

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,720
patrick what are the roles that you're

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:45,919
seeing are needed

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,960
uh to be filled um as we start to see

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,240
more

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,200
data on kubernetes as data on kubernetes

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,440
becomes

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,399
you know more common you know as people

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,880
are building out their architectures

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:01,039
well i mean i the role that i that i

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,200
really love right now is the sres

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,039
um the site reliability engineers

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,000
they're they're really responsible for

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,000
the stack

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,760
and they're the unsung heroes of

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,240
anything at scale at this point

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,760
and so huge shout out to my sres out

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,599
there

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,879
and i think that's that's that's a

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,359
growing field

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,159
because as we build out more expertise

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,320
and infrastructure

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,280
and scale infrastructure and reduce the

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,720
surface area

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,040
of configuration um

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,839
the getting down into the weeds i mean

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,679
how many of us

00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:34,159
have set up a kernel driver on a linux

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,800
server not too many anymore right that's

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:37,520
just

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,240
not a thing that we're doing but sres

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,599
are

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,520
i think is the role i i

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,440
counsel young people all the time is if

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,560
you're interested in infrastructure

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,159
learn how to code first then look at

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,760
sres being an sre

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,839
because that is the future bill

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,280
yeah i think overall in terms of just

00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:58,560
not scaling out

00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,480
the infrastructure we're talking about

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,440
how do we scale our individuals to be

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,200
able to do more

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,800
so when we're talking about these sres

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,320
and what maybe was an infrastructure

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,079
admin in in the past

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,079
we're talking about a much lower ratio

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,200
in terms of how many developers are

00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,000
actually being supported by

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,079
an individual uh sre in today's world so

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,079
there might be only a team of 10

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,920
sres that's supporting a complete

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,760
enterprise environment

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
so really when we talk about scale we're

00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,400
not just talking about it from a

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,760
technology perspective we're talking

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,040
about it from a cultural perspective

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,800
we're talking about it from

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,240
the underlying automation that has to

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,680
happen in order to manage

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,440
all of these different things that are

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,240
running in a highly highly complex

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,240
environment

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,280
so it is a dramatic culture shift and i

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,119
think that that's

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,800
when you talk about what needs to come

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,480
first is you need to have that visionary

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,079
you need to have that person that said

00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,760
the way we're doing things today or

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,640
yesterday is no longer going to work for

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,079
our business

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,760
and we need to think about things

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,280
differently we need to not go and do

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,000
these manual efforts we need to start

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,079
thinking about

00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,400
how do we do that thing again but in an

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,920
automated process manner

00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,680
honey to finish it up yeah so

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,359
i'm a big believer that kubernetes has

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,119
created a parallel ecosystem in parallel

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,800
universe

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,440
so currently we have this broad umbrella

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,359
that says kubernetes administrator but

00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,520
what i actually think is

00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,800
given the complexity and the growing

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,079
importance of

00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
various building blocks within the

00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:21,280
equipment's ecosystem right whether it

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,560
is network whether it is storage whether

00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,680
it is security

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,400
or release management we are going to

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,560
see

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,640
the counterparts of the traditional

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,359
administrative roles

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,079
in the uh in the cloud native ecosystem

00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:36,000
so

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,920
i think a year from now we'll actually

00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,240
see job titles that will say

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,680
cloud native storage operations

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,800
professional you know

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,040
storage ops it's a big deal and again an

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,720
average uh developer or a kubernetes

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,599
administrator cannot deal with

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,800
complex cni-based networks like calico

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,119
so you need a cloud native

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,960
network engineer and then you know you

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,079
have sres who will cover the entire

00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,480
spectrum

00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,200
and we're going to have highly focused

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,119
specialized

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,880
devsecops roles so sre today is like a

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,240
very broad term and they are basically

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,000
doing everything that they can

00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,640
but eventually we are going to have very

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,160
specialized roles and job functions

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,880
and definitions that will bring laser

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,560
focus

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,240
to the building blocks of kubernetes

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,320
stack i think that's that's where we are

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,480
headed to

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,119
this has been really great thank you all

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:36,320
