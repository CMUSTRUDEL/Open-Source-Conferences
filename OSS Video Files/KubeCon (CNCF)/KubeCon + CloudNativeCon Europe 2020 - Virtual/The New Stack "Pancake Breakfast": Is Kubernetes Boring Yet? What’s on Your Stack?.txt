The New Stack "Pancake Breakfast": Is Kubernetes Boring Yet? What’s on Your Stack? 

Kubernetes is boring and that’s a good thing. It’s what’s on top of Kubernetes that counts. So join us for a short stack with The New Stack as we ask: “What’s on your stack?” We’ll pass the virtual syrup, and talk about all that goes with Kubernetes. It may be stateless, but that also means there’s plenty of room for sides.
