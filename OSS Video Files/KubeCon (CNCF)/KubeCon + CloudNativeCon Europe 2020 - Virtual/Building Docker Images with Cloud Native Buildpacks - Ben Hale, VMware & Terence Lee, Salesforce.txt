Building Docker Images with Cloud Native Buildpacks - Ben Hale, VMware & Terence Lee, Salesforce 

In today’s cloud-native world, Docker Images are the lingua franca for platform portability. Unfortunately creating great, secure, and efficient images can be difficult and time consuming. In this talk, you'll learn about Cloud Native Buildpacks, a high-level abstraction for building application images. Buildpacks are a standardized tool for creating images in a secure, reproducible, and efficient manner. As an application developer, you don't need to know the best practices for command ordering to optimize layer reusability. As an operator, you will minimize the security hazards developers my introduce. Come learn how buildpacks meet developers at their source code, automate the delivery of both OS-level and application-level dependency upgrades, and help you efficiently handle day-two operations.
