CNCF Research User Group - Eduardo Arango, Red Hat & Bob Killen, University of Michigan 

Interested in improving the Research experience with Kubernetes, or simply running research workloads on it? The CNCF Research User Group’s purpose is to serve as a focal point for the discussion and advancement of Research Computing using “Cloud Native” technologies. Since the group’s inception 6 months ago, key areas have been identified as gaps within the ecosystem. This session would serve as an opportunity to share with a broader audience some of the key challenges the Research-user-group has identified, and showcase project updates on key tools that the research community is developing to address these challenges.

hello everyone my name is bob killen i

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,880
am a research cloud administrator for

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,880
the university of michigan

00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,120
and hello everyone my name is eduardo

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,639
rango i'm a software engineer for red

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,639
hat

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,240
and we are here to present about the

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,240
cncf research user group

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:28,000
next slide so

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,800
first i sort of want to get into why

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
well with the the people attending this

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,320
talk i don't think i actually have to

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,200
talk

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,320
about 200 of these points but in the

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,079
research ecosystem

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,160
we've seen an increased use of

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,239
containers everywhere

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,160
and with that has come more complex

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
workflows and not just for the research

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,640
process

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,480
itself but with enterprises and all

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,039
sorts of groups sort of getting involved

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
in things like machine learning things

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
like model lifecycle are becoming much

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,000
more important

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,760
now also riding on that we're seeing

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
much more adoption of things like

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,640
streaming data and eventing based on

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,159
that data

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,840
something that historically hasn't been

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,840
done too much in the research field

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,600
additionally we're sort of seeing

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,640
greater use of interactive science

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,280
gateways

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,040
these days people are just expecting to

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,960
get something like a jupiter notebook to

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
interact with their data

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,080
and sort of like backing those science

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,880
gateways

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,240
and data streaming services is the

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,280
persistent services

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,720
that are needed to support them and

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,400
all these things actually lend

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,840
themselves really well

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
to kubernetes it gives us a platform

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,520
agnostic api that

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,640
aids in the scheduling and management of

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
those different workloads

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:51,520
so why form

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,520
a user group

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,719
most research-oriented like

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,439
most research-related workloads are

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,680
different uh we are

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,640
a also a mu different from what you'd

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,840
run into enterprise

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,080
i'm sorry um we are a much

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,800
smaller subset of users than those that

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,800
are running enterprise focused services

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
much of what we do is very sort of like

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,319
a job or task

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,360
focused with potentially hundreds of

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,200
thousands of jobs

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
akin to sort of what you'd see at a site

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,160
running something like slurm

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,879
these are also very resource intensive

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,800
and you would know

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,800
and you're like normal bin packing isn't

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,959
necessarily going to be the best way of

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,599
running those workloads

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,959
we also require more advanced scheduling

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,840
than what kubernetes can provide out of

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,879
the box

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,480
the best example of this being mpi or

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,160
recording the scheduling of multiple

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,920
pods to launching around at the same

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,440
time

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,440
workarounds have sort of been developed

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,160
by multiple little communities like

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,239
there's the mpi operator in kubeflow

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,760
a very awesome up-and-coming project

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,920
called volcano that is a sandbox project

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
um there's sort of like several other

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,959
little

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,640
things that out there that sort of rely

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,000
on stateful sets to sort of do

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,440
like offer that similar behavior now mpi

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,840
isn't the only thing

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
many environments are large and actually

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,959
require

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,599
additional support for things like fair

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,680
share

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,720
cues and a whole lot of other things

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,000
when you're running on something like

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,879
bare metal

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,879
and while these things haven't

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,360
necessarily been forgotten by upstream

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,120
they have

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,120
largely been underrepresented

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,280
and i like that last word because also

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,480
why to form a user group is to represent

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,799
us all so that's what i like from

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,319
the cloud native foundation is we're

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,480
creating this user group

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,599
to share to share pain points to have

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,640
a weekly or monthly meeting to say is

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,920
not working for me

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,519
it's failing and i need some help and

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,040
as bob said this is a small user group

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:59,120
and we need as much help as we can so

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,519
this is a group for sharing success

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,799
histories like the project volcano that

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,519
bob also told us and all the new ideas

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,319
are

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,519
coming from these small groups and this

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,640
is a common place

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,519
so we can share and we can request

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,160
feedback from

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,519
others in the same field trying to make

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,040
research a little

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,759
more cloud-making and when i say these

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,840
small groups i mean like we have a small

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,040
projects coming out of cern like the

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,280
latest hd contour operator or

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,840
the common workflow language now being

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,560
able to interact with kubernetes

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,440
and we have universities also joining

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
gray

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,680
so it is growing we have some

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,800
enterprises universities and research

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,400
institutes join

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,680
and the idea is so we can grow this into

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:57,840
more people so we can share ideas

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,840
among the same mindsets

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,160
so we've been involved with kubernetes

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,360
uh for quite some time and um

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
i've been able to speak with a lot of

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
research groups over the past few years

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,120
many of these groups are

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,280
grappling with the same set of problems

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,840
and developing solutions and workarounds

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,560
in

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,000
silos there hasn't been sort of a strong

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
unifying group

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,800
to sort of help drive the research

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
computing needs in the cloud native

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,440
ecosystem

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,120
and that's sort of the real idea for

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,440
this user group

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
bringing the you know communities and

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,880
groups that

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,360
eduardo just mentioned together and be

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,280
one unifying voice

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,440
now there there have been some various

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,720
like rumblings and efforts in the past

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,880
boss actually sort of came to a head um

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,080
last year at cube county u in barcelona

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,759
where a bunch of us

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,600
also like met together over a lunch for

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
a few days and we decided we should sort

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,600
of make something happen

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,280
and originally it was going to be a

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,319
curious working group but over time it

00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,280
evolved into cncf uh into the cncf user

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,280
group that it is today

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,560
and with that we sort of like over those

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,160
you know few

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,080
uh lunches and later on some of the

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,120
meetings we identified some common

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,680
themes

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
um so some of the big things that stuck

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,400
out is

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,319
we don't actually really know who's all

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,240
doing research on kubernetes and what

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
sort of research they're doing

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,280
everyone sort of feels like they're off

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,000
on their own in the dark

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,160
and sort of seconding that there isn't

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,960
really a good set of best practices for

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,880
operating like

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,479
large clusters or clusters that are

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,680
intended to support a large amount of

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,759
jobs

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
the defaults don't support an

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,840
environment with a larger

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,280
like a large amount of churn as well now

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,039
the things like curious itself out of

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,240
the box doesn't support running

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
workloads like mpi the base

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,880
batch capabilities are kind of lacking

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,400
there and while there are

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,080
so like other things like there's

00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,120
there's multiple multi-cluster tools out

00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
there most don't

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
lend themselves to the distribution of

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,319
jobs they

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,440
um lend themselves to the distribution

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,080
of like your standard

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,960
application type deployments um they're

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,599
very sort of

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,080
focused on ensuring that you know sort

00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,280
of like

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,759
x number of deployments are

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,720
across multiple clusters not x number of

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,680
jobs are spread evenly across the mall

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,880
the other thing is multi-tenancy itself

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,479
is also a problem

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
kubernetes isn't really like your sort

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:27,919
of standard hpc environment where

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,479
everyone has a posix identity you're now

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,560
dealing with

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,479
application identity and these are just

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,400
a few of the common themes

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,919
we've seen and with that we actually

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,479
decided to start a few

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,479
initiatives

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,120
so let's talk about the initiatives that

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,400
have come from the

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,919
researchers group so right now we want

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,639
to highlight these three main

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,639
initiatives

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,199
the first one as i was talking about

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,160
communities we want to know

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,800
how big this community can be and we

00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,039
want to know

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,039
who is using kubernetes who is using

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,560
kubernetes and cloud native tools

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,319
overall for research

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,800
so at the end of this presentation we

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,800
have some links and we are

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,080
asking everyone to go into those links

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,080
and fill some forms

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,360
because we want to already know how big

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,520
is this community

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,039
and like the question that you are

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,400
reading here what type of workloads

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,560
you're running

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,039
uh who have deployed what and where

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,879
so uh we wanna here if you are running

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,479
research on bare metal if you're running

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,039
research on the cloud

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,919
if you're doing something hybrid so we

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,320
want to know that

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,560
and we are asking everyone to fill this

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,599
survey

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,599
we also have this index and we wanna

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,279
we're always seeing this of awesome list

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,800
as every

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,720
solution right now has awesome list and

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,320
i remember my first awesome list was

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
awesome containers

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,600
i remember now and we want to have this

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
awesome list of

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
projects that can help other researchers

00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
to get

00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,279
their job done because at the end that's

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,959
the main idea of this user group

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,880
some random researcher in a random

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,360
research institute just coming into this

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,360
group

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,640
getting help getting his research done

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,360
saving

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,120
the world from what's coming and a

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:16,720
researcher can save us

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,320
and we're going to create this house

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,240
only so they can find things

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:24,720
easier and also the one of

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,040
one of the good ideas that is coming

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
from this initiative is the book of best

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,920
practices

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
and as bob said there are a lot of

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,680
things that are not

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,800
out of the blue for kubernetes and we

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,839
want to write this guideline

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,800
for common topics and user stories best

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,080
practices

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,480
and things that can help

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,440
from the system admin to the research

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,519
user

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,399
to use cloud-native tools to get

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,399
research done

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,680
so the cloud native research workloads

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,959
book really wants to target system

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,200
admins operator

00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,720
research software engineers and research

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,399
support staff

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,560
so kind of like in

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,640
where we are right now that we don't say

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,560
system admins anymore it evolved from

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,160
system admin to the devops guy

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,040
to the operator guy now we say sre

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,800
but it's kind of back to the guy that is

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,600
dealing with all the issues the system i

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,800
mean

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,200
we want to write this guideline with

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,320
user stories with pain points as i was

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,440
saying in the

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:37,360
previous slides and really take

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,200
down from day one to day x

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,279
what you should be doing with your qr

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,839
netease deployment and how to operate

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,800
that

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
in a good way so you don't get into the

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,040
researchers

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:52,240
workloads right like interrupting

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,519
runs and executions and also protecting

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,560
data because that's

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,320
something that is very hard as bob was

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,200
saying the multi-tenancy and research

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,959
environments

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
you all the time need to be thinking

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,240
that researcher a

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,079
is not deleting or reading information

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,920
from researcher b

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,360
and we want to make research cloud

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:15,200
native with this book

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,440
when we say this is i i personally want

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,440
and we want a community

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,920
to help researchers teachers and

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,120
students to get things done

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,760
faster easier and in a better way

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,680
so if we can help researchers teachers

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,560
to get things done with containers and

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,880
have fun

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,160
as we are a community having fun making

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,519
things boring

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,760
and if those things are boring so

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,640
the researcher teacher can just use it

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,600
as a tool

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,360
and have that as a guideline in a book

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,760
that that is going to be an awesome

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,760
project

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,279
so cluster operations the topics we want

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:55,200
to touch in this book is

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,440
configuration management and cluster

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,760
life cycle so

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,480
which things to install from day one how

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,880
to operate them how to

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,480
update them how to upgrade them how to

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,200
delete them if you don't need them

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,839
anymore so

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,320
the life cycle of an application in top

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,079
on top of your qnets cluster we want to

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,920
write that down as a guideline

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,120
management of clusters on top of

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,959
openstack so

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,560
a lot of research institutions are right

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,880
now using openstack

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,880
integration with parallel hpc file

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,959
system and access management

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,399
so it get very important when you start

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,079
talking about like mpi

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,079
and things like that how can you make

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,839
your qr net disk cluster interact

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:37,839
via our dnas and be a specialized

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,360
hardware so here we are not talking

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,839
about software but hardware

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,120
how can you enable that specialized

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,399
hardware to your

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,560
your netis cluster exposing gpu so your

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,760
qr net is closer in a good way

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
and manage large escape cluster right

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,920
like

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,880
1000 nodes in just so everyone in this

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,760
cloud native community can make sense of

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,920
numbers

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,920
in a research institution and research

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,760
facility of hpc

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,240
1000 nodes is really just the login node

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
so in our hpc institution you start

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,880
talking about

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,880
10 000 nodes 20 000 nodes and that is

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,480
considered like a middle

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,720
kind of size hpc deployment so 1000

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,200
nodes is really the login

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,200
system

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,480
so configuration management there are

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
some things that

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,160
uh i was discussing with uh bob before

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,920
this presentation

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,680
what tooling work when provisioning

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,320
notes is really

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,920
not that easy to solve qr headings in a

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,079
bare metal cluster

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,320
is not like when you request to your

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,040
cloud provider hey give me a kubernetes

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,639
cluster

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,480
here's my credit card and you get a

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,279
kubernetes cluster running

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
and some dollars left of your credit

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,320
card

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,399
but uh how to do that in your own

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,040
cluster in your own systems is not that

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,480
easy

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,880
so what tooling to use and how to use it

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,600
because you can use different tools but

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,079
is

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,360
not that standard how to use them how is

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:16,959
authentication

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,120
managed and for me this is

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,720
a very important like authentication and

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,959
also the security policies for

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,320
multi-user multi-tenant

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,079
on a research cluster

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,079
because it gets very messy in

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,920
multi-tenant environments so we need

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:36,399
to be able to differentiate users

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,720
projects a user can be in different

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,800
projects like let's say a professor

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,880
our teacher can be in different projects

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,680
so he has access to different kind of

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,680
data

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,800
but also there are some researchers that

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,519
can only read

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,560
one specific side of the data so we need

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
to be able to

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,720
separate that and there are some things

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,000
that are right now in placing kubernetes

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,959
but we want also to be

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
able to propose things that doesn't

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,560
exist yet

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,560
and how to do that do them in a good way

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,480
openstack and parallelify system again

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,160
we want to write

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,680
in this book all the good practices

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,240
guidelines on how to deploy your qr nets

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,399
cluster

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,839
in on top of a running open stack

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,880
installation like

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,040
we don't want to get into how to run and

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,000
deploy openstack that there are books

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,040
for that

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,959
uh we're running from you have a open

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,079
stock running you already

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,480
graded all your openstack books and this

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,480
is a

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,079
extra book on top of those openstack

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,560
books that you're going to read

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,880
on how to if you have openstack now how

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,639
can you then use ironic to deploy bare

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,440
metal provisioning how to

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,639
you can integrate with other tools in

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,320
the ecosystem

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,279
to put your qr nets cluster on top of

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,399
openstack

00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:00,560
also how to do parallel file systems in

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:02,800
the way hpc system ecosystem does it

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,880
now in a cloud-native way so we want to

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,880
write these guidelines in this book

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,759
gpus this is one of my favorite topics i

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,040
i am part of the gpu operator and i

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,639
maintain

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,600
how to run gpus for red hat

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,079
so i'm very passionate about this and

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,880
writing

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
guidelines and a book about how to do

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,000
this

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
is very important and then helping

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,399
researchers

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,279
to enable their gpus and new and shiny

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,120
nvidia dgx or whatever or if you are in

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,320
the amd ecosystem

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,839
uh how to do that also so these

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
guidelines are going to help from the

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,440
system admin

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,040
sres to the researchers to expose the

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,639
new and shiny gpus

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,959
so then they can run tube flow or aiml

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,959
research on top of those gpus

00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:01,759
but okay that sort of kicks over to

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,440
the other side of the coin the not the

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,120
people necessarily running the clusters

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,039
but the people consuming them

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,600
and your researchers your teachers your

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,760
students this might also eventually be

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,120
like other enterprise type customers

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,880
that are looking at a dashboard for

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,640
report on something

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,079
but with all that we sort of identified

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,360
a few

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,360
big key areas one jupiter hub

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,520
probably the number one requested

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,720
application

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,480
jupiter hub is commonly deployed at most

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,400
research sites and it's quickly becoming

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,559
sort of the de facto standard

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
for uh ways to people to sort of like

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,200
consume the stuff especially on top of

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,600
kubernetes

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,880
now there have been some issues in the

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,799
past and there continues to be some

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,480
problems specifically around like user

00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,080
identity management

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,880
um you know how do i plug into my

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,520
you know active directory ldap and uh

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,559
you know

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,320
provision a pod as that user that can

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,000
actually like translate to a

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,679
posix identity for that person to

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,600
communicate with our you know campus

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,760
managed file services

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,880
um so there have been a lot of issues

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,240
especially with trying to you know

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,360
integrate with kerberos and like

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,640
candidating and things of that nature

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,880
there's also been things like image

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,960
management problems where you might have

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,160
a whole slew of different images for

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
different classes and different people

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,720
to consume

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,440
next sort of building on top of jupiter

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,400
hub a little bit

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,559
is actually kubeflow and machine

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,200
learning this or life cycle management

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,000
and just as like jupiter hub has sort of

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,840
become

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,240
the standard for things cube flow is

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,240
quickly becoming sort of the the go-to

00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,000
for things specifically related to

00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,679
machine learning and machine

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,200
learning life cycle management it is

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,520
actually a sort of

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,720
large collection of tools that have all

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
been bundled together

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,720
um and like integrate really really well

00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
with each other

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,400
the kubeflow team has done a incredible

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,919
job with that

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,280
and you know the the one thing that's a

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,640
little bit lacking is like there's a lot

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,240
of people are getting up and going

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,240
but the best practices around doing

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,200
sweat don't you know quite exist quite

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,280
yet

00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,480
um and there's sort of like some other

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,919
little aspects of it like

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,520
uh it is possible to make it

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,240
multi-tenant but

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,840
it you know the the stories around and

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,360
people actually doing it multi-tenant

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,840
is is uh i'll say a little bit lacking

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,280
there's

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,240
people are still like off in the dark

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,760
trying to do it themselves

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,919
the other thing you heard me sort of

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,760
like touch upon this earlier

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,120
is like batch computing and mpi

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,799
these things are not supported by

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,000
kubernetes by default but there

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,400
are tools out there that do enable that

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,919
for

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,600
kubernetes the the big one

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,200
if you've happened to see me talk about

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
stuff before you you've probably heard

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,280
me reference

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,160
volcano a

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:55,039
cncf sandbox project that is bringing

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,360
these sort of like

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,640
classic batch computing style things to

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,840
kubernetes and it

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,600
provides things like uh cues backfill

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:07,280
and all things that you would find in a

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:10,559
classic environment

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,120
okay the next thing

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,159
is sort of the various like workflow

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,880
engine and get ups

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:19,120
uh there this is a very large ecosystem

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,799
with a host of different tools

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
probably one of the most common ones out

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,120
there these days is argo

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,559
and it's actually used by like kubeflow

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,080
under the hood

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,919
but you know it's not the only one out

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,600
there there are many others out there

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,760
and some general guidance around you

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,080
know what tools exist and how to use

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,720
them

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,200
uh would be very useful the other thing

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,000
and

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,640
after talking for some time we had

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,039
originally

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,799
like lumped in git ops and was sort of

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,320
like workflow engines since they sort of

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,200
you know have a very close relationship

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,120
with each other

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,559
but it's now a large enough topic where

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,840
it will probably be spun off into its

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:55,039
own

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:55,600
chapter and actually uh started working

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,919
on a

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,200
paper uh where we will probably see a

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
lot more results from that

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,240
um i don't know with the timeline for it

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,240
but but sometime soon

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,520
so how like we want to answer these

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
questions on how

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
researchers can like effectively use git

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:14,000
ops we've seen

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,880
you know what storing everything in git

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
has done

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,120
for you know the management of sort of

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,080
enterprise applications

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,280
and being able to tie you know what

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,320
iteration of a model

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:27,760
to the code to the data that was run to

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,400
like produce the result

00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,159
and we've seen how useful that is now we

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,679
just need to sort of like

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,760
write a little bit of how more people

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,480
can do it

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,159
uh lastly we sort of have the concept of

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,520
like data ops and this sort of

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,880
you know all these things sort of like

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,760
work off each other and integrate with

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,840
each other

00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,360
but like managing data in sort of a

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,000
cloud-native way or cloud-native

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,919
environment

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,080
is fundamentally different from your

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,320
classic hpc system

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,240
so in your normal hpc system where you

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:58,159
have that parallel file system

00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,600
and everything has a posix identity

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,720
where everyone's logging into like a

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,440
login node

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,480
um that doesn't really exist in a

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,559
traditional way

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,080
in sort of the cloud native space so

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,520
this might be you know shifting more

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,120
people to learning to use like

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,960
object storage um

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,400
you know being able to use something

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,400
like ceph to be able to mount certain

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,640
things up to different places

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,679
and the other thing is like how how do

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,760
we sort of

00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,280
store and look at this data and save in

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,919
a way that's accessible through like you

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,360
know the workflow

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:33,039
engines and all that other fun stuff

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,000
so with that um we sort of covered a

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,640
little bit of

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
of what the group is and what we're

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,360
trying to do

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,840
and how important like you know this

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,840
book is

00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,440
and what we would really like from you

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,400
is to you sort of go and visit some of

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:52,799
the stuff we were talking about earlier

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,640
so you can help us by going into like

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,720
the the scene safe research user group

00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,760
repo and fill out the site survey
