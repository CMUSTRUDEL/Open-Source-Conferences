Build & Deploy a CNF in 5 Minutes - Rastislav Szabo, PANTHEON.tech 

Cloud Native Network Function (CNF) is a software implementation of a network function, traditionally performed on a physical device (e.g. IPv4/v6 router, L2 bridge/switch, VPN gateway, firewall), but built and deployed in a cloud-native way.  This talk will show a live demo on how a CNF providing cloud-native NAT (Network Address Translation) functionality can be built and deployed into a Kubernetes cluster within 5 minutes. To achieve that, several open source projects will be used: FD.io (an open source terabit software dataplane), Ligato.io (programming framework for building CNF control and management plane) and Network Service Mesh for interconnecting CNFs in a Kubernetes cluster on required network layers.
