Making Envoy Contributions Feasible for Everyone - Yaroslav Skopets, Tetrate.io 

Have you ever considered contributing to Envoy? What stops you? Is it C++? Is it completely different toolset? Just don't feel yourself productive? Well, we've got some news for you. Thanks to a shiny, brand-new technology (WebAssembly), Envoy is becoming a polyglot. And putting the human factor first, it means that now You can contribute using the toolbox that works best for You. Paraphrasing, a demo is worth a thousand words. Let's pick a language that everybody claims to be good at (JavaScript) and, surprisingly, use it to extend Envoy. We'll do it live, under 5 minutes and have fun along the away (instead of cursing the-never-ending C++ compilation).
