Kubernetes? But I'm a Product Manager… - Matthew McNeeney, Independent & Miguel Luna, VMware 

Good product teams care deeply about their users and the experience they provide to them, yet many Product Managers shy away from conversations about Kubernetes, believing that it’s something for their engineering counterparts to think about. But this is a critical mistake; many of the benefits Kubernetes brings can be harnessed to deliver better products, faster.  The Kubernetes.io tagline is ‘Production-Grade Container Orchestration’, so it’s easy to see why Product Managers tend to leave it aside as an engineering concern. But much of the innovative work happening in the ecosystem can be used to ship software faster and deliver great user experiences. This talk will cover how Product Managers building different types of software can utilise features in Kubernetes to build extensible, scalable and cloud-agnostic products that drive better customer outcomes.
