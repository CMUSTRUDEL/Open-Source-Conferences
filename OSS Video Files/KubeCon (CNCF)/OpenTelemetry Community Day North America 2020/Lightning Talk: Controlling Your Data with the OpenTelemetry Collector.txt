Lightning Talk: Controlling Your Data with the OpenTelemetry Collector

How do people change telemetry data to support use-cases including PII redaction, downsampling, custom tags and fixing instrumentation flaws? The OpenTelemetry Collector! Telemetry data contains a lot of valuable information, but sometimes that data may or may not contain what people want. Modifying telemetry data by updating instrumentation often proves challenging due in part to application impact. The OpenTelemetry project solves this problem by providing a pluggable architecture in the OpenTelemetry Collector. Learn how others have configured it to support a variety of different use-cases.
