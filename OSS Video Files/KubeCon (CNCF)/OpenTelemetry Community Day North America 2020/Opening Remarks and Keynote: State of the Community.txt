yeah uh this is actually our second open

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,320
telemetry community event

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
uh we did a uh observability uh focused

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,000
uh

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:37,200
event at the cncf uh uh

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,559
con last year um but this definitely is

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,040
our first year uh being able to do it as

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,239
a official uh as official sandbox

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,079
project officially

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,800
about open telemetry specifically rather

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,480
than about observability as a whole

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,079
yeah so today um

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,160
again we want to welcome you to this

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,760
event this is hopefully something a

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,000
little different than if you've been to

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,800
virtual conferences this year

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and you're expecting just uh eight hours

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,920
of zoom

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
well you might be we can assure you that

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
we're as tired of that as you are like

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,760
yes we want to have this be interactive

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,799
we want to have you really participate

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
and share because

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,439
everyone here is an expert not just the

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,840
people up on stage so

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,280
yes we all learn better together and so

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,479
we've tried to make something that is a

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,080
little more

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,560
interactive than maybe what you're used

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,320
to and we'll go through that

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840
at the end of these remarks we'll kind

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,119
of give you a tour of the platform and

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,960
make sure everyone

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,880
understands how to use all the bits and

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,000
bobs so that we can all make this the

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,000
best output

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,280
today ever which since it's the first

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,720
one it will be by default

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,960

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,759
larger project level and i believe we

then we'd love to get all that kind of

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,959
in the same place so

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,040

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,080
so that's where you kind of want to do a

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,239
lot of the chat

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,599
outside of like the zoom chat or the

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,720
breakouts

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,280
so if you aren't in there already then

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,280
join up

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,840
and with that said i think liz i think

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,040
you actually mentioned this you know

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
whenever you're kind of

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,400
doing a year interview or save the

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,400
community or whatever i think it's good

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,680
to kind of look back where we've been

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,920
right so let's go back let's rewind a

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,519
fascinating year uh even if it weren't

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,040
for a pandemic

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
remember we were all able to get

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,799
together in person that was so

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
yeah right what's this this was wild

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,599
right i look at this

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,599
i look at the picture here of the crowd

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,440
and just like

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,680
people did that people just sat right

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,400
like people sat right next to each other

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,640
with no masks on what is this madness

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,680
yeah so last year we did uh the

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,680
observability

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
practitioner summit uh as day zero with

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,400
kubecon and we did a live stream of the

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,799
event

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
uh so now congratulations welcome you

00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,200
are all part of the live stream for this

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
year

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
uh we also presented open telemetry to

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,120
the world

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,000
uh and to the broader cncf community on

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
stage at the

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,040
coupe at the cubecon keynote and there

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
was also a maintainers panel and

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,080
lots and lots and lots of workshops and

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,120
talks about open telemetry

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,000
last year um at coupon last year

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,840
but you know it it isn't just a one-time

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,560
event right like open source development

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,800
and governance

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
is a longer term effort that we have to

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
devote our energy

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,479
to throughout the year and there are a

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,080
lot of important milestones that we

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
should celebrate that we've accomplished

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,360
over the past year

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,360
yeah so let's talk about the first one

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,680
so we spent a lot of time on zoom calls

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,400
and stream yard

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,919
and uh and like stream not to be

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
confused with lightstep over the past

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,919
year

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,360
as well as a lot of talking to each

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,400
other on theater because you know if we

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,080
can't meet in person

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,440
at least we can see each other's faces

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,520
on seg calls we can

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,000
talk to each other and continue to drive

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,960
the project forward

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,759
and i think what's really remarkable and

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,919
personally

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
i i have some numbers on this in the

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,320
later slide

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,680
but it's remarkable how little

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,800
um the pandemic and sort of world events

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,520
have not we haven't really missed a step

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
right like

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,680
the project is from every metric that

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,080
you can possibly imagine has actually

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,759
done

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,000
extremely well and i think that's

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,479
important to keep in mind

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,680
so let's talk about just some of the

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
numbers some of the

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,199
the high level stats here we've added

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,320
two people to the governance committee

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,320
two brand new members

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,000
um congratulations from companies that

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,919
were not previously represented so we're

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,960
kind of diversifying a set of people on

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,600
the governance committee

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,120
uh both from a kind of diversity of the

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,320
people and diversity of the

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,360
uh of their employer's perspective

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,199
also another woman

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,600
congratulations to lobito we've also

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,520
reached a milestone where we've over 200

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,960
companies have contributed

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,800
code or documentation or issues

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,759
or anything to the open telemetry

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,039
project which is a huge milestone

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,720
in terms of i think adoption

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,400
and and sort of the seriousness of the

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,639
project from

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,560
you know businesses from people that use

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,800
these this software in production right

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,800
or will be using the software in

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,919
production and it's not just you know

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,960
america right it's a complete global

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,560
project we have

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,080
contributors in over 30 countries

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,840
more than that actually by south county

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,520
at 30. and our overall level of activity

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,919
both in terms of

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,919
issues prs

00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:50,080
lost lives there for a second issues prs

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,120
um has increased 400 percent

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,840
year-over-year so

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
just comparing this time last year to

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,759
today

00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,120
we're at 400 increase

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,960
and that's leads to over 1400

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
individual contributors and over 110 000

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,639
contributions to the project

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,319
in 2020 so far and i want to be clear

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,800
that when we talk about contribution

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
here

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,080
uh both dev stats and we view it as

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
important

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,440
just as important when people file

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,240
issues triage issues leave comments on

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,160
issues

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,520
as when people commit code right like

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,880
the project is not just the set of

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,639
committers the project is

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,919
everyone who has in some way made the

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,639
project better

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,400
yeah and it's i think it's uh important

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,039
to also note like

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,680
it hasn't just been devs right we've

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,080
seen

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,840
project managers uh get involved helping

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,319
to triage issues helping to make sure

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,919
that

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,240
work is communicated clearly to both

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,240
major stakeholders in the outside world

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,879
um to help coordinate

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
sort of these big cross-cutting changes

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,800
uh around the project

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,319
so it's it's really been a year of i

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,840
think maturity

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,160
for open telemetry it's kind of gone

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,039
from

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,840
20 30 50 people hanging around some zoom

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,199
calls

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,720
and figuring out how to take these two

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
disparate worlds and and put them

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
together into

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,639
something that has its own identity and

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:18,639
its own real arc that you can see

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,639
oh wait there's more there's more

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,080
as the project's matured it's not just

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,000
been in sort of an organizational

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,479
sense it's also been an actual like use

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,840
of you know utility sense right

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:35,039
there's over 200 integrations exporters

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,320
plugins for various components that have

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,959
been added to the open telemetry

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,919
registry not all of those

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,399
are things that we maintain right as a

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,040
project

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,560
a lot of these are actually third-party

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,959
integrations that have been contributing

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,399
you know

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,040
that are maintained by people outside of

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,839
the project which is really cool to see

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,040
we also have really broadened the set of

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,360
languages that we support

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,279
when we announced last year we had

00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,680
basically five or six languages that we

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,720
were

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,880
in beta for uh but now we have a much

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,560
more comprehensive set of support for

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
pretty much any language that you can uh

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
shake a stick at that people actually

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,480
use in production

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,160
the other exciting thing is that the

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,440
open telemetry uh

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,279
line protocol uh well i guess or otlp uh

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
has really become mature enough that

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,800
people can use it as

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,880
the common way that they send telemetry

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,760
data and therefore a number of people

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,440
have stopped

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,360
using custom exporters and just said you

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,040
know what otlp is mature enough that we

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,880
can just accept and consume it directly

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,080
which is really exciting

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,680
and that also has really helped the

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,120
interoperability story with the open

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,600
telemetry collector being

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,600
mature enough that people can use it as

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,760
a swiss army knife to both use

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,839
open telemetry as well as older

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,120
protocols and get all their data in one

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
place

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,200
it's really kind of like a swiss army

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,680
knife you know it's the bridge

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
from old to new and it's super exciting

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,000
to see

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,320
the collector mature and develop

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,320
all of this has led us to having a huge

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,160
amount of you know public adopters

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,800
and support for the project so

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,240
that's everyone from you know major

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,920
cloud providers who

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,680
who are releasing distributions of open

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,560
telemetry that kind of works with their

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,040
stuff

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,800
to people that are adopting open

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,880
telemetry in production

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,839
in their systems today as a way as end

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,880
users which is

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,320
end users yeah so it's really on both

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,640
sides of the equation

00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
you're seeing people jump into this with

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,880
both feet

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,680
which for a project that is still kind

00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,920
of

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,920
hasn't had a general release yet is

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,079
really impressive

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,079
and it's all thanks to you see you

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,279
internet

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,279
give yourselves a pat in the back

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,320
so i feel like that's been a pretty good

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,360
recap of the last year wouldn't you say

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
liz

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,640
yeah definitely there are lots of things

00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,120
that have happened that we can't

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,560
couldn't

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
include in the slides but i think that's

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,920
a good summary of kind of where

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,920
we're at uh so now let's talk about

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,079
what's ahead for us

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:13,200
yeah so this is

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,160
i'm sure everyone everyone that uh on

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,240
this call that is

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,440
a shall we say hotel contributor

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
probably understands um how good we are

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,640
with

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,839
dates and times and estimating those but

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,839
let's see

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
let's

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,360
like it's easier to have more certainty

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,880
when you have more of a kind of track

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,200
record and trajectory or rather than

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
just

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,640
you know throwing darts in the dark yeah

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,240
i would say we got a lot better

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,680
estimation this year too

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,120
um but let's look forward to what is the

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,320
near future hold

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,600
well right now we're expecting we have

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,240
released candidates

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,920
for distributed the distributed tracing

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,600
component right if you think about open

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,959
telemetry you know for some of you that

00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,839
maybe are not as familiar with the

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,760
project

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
you can kind of break open telemetry

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,399
into some

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,240
big cross-cutting components tracing

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,360
metrics logs

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,360
context and tools so tracing

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,680
which is sort of the foundation of a lot

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,920
of this is

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,959
very close to being done um or at least

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,240
done enough for a 1.0 release so we have

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,000
released candidates of tracing in

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,040
progress that was announced uh several

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,480
weeks ago

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:32,320
and i'm not going to say

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,760
a date but hopefully by the end of the

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,240
year we'll see

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,079
those release candidates be firmed up

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,680
the more work that we get it get done on

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,959
it including today when we have a chance

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,040
to all talk face-to-face

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:46,959
synchronously the faster it'll go

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,880
and let's see on the metrics front um

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,720
the aim is to get release candidates out

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,279
in the first half of 2021

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,399
um recognizing that metrics has been

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,320
kind of a little bit

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
further behind in terms of finalizing

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,279
what the spec is going to be and

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,480
therefore finalizing what

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,240
uh the sdks need to do yeah and we have

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,279
a newcomer since last year which is

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,440
logging

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,639
we've added on the logging sig and

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,480
discussion about logging

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,480
specification and that is

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,079
and that will be uh hopefully pressing

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,800
into an alpha

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,240
in the first half of 2021 quick question

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,079
of the chat what's an sdk

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,560
so the sdk is the software development

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,560
kit right it's a

00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,160
it's the part of the code that makes the

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,240
thing do

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,519
there's a specification for the api

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,600
which is the

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,560
thing you actually program against and

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,839
then the sdk

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
is sort of the implementation of that

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,360
api so

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,040
yeah i to you a person in the chat with

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,399
a question

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,079
there's going to be some breakout

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,600
sessions starting after these keynotes

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:53,760
one of them is going to be

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,360
kind of open telemetry for beginners i

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,839
would certainly recommend

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,720
you drop into one of those and we'll be

00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,079
able to discuss

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,440
all of them

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,959
so those are some of the telemetry

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,760
formats that we aim to support over the

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,360
longer term

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,440
and the tracing is just the first of

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
them so we've got more coming

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,160
yep more more is coming but technical

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,760
work is not the only piece of open

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,440
telemetry we also need to talk about the

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,519
community right like this after all is

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,880
the uh community introduction so

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,240
let's talk a little bit about what the

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,040
community milestones we have that are

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,240
upcoming

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,040
yeah so one thing i'm particularly

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,480
excited about as a maintainer for the

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,160
communications of sig is really working

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,040
on all of this community content

00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,160
so we are working on sort of a visual

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,680
asset library

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,639
and a standardized design language i

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,680
guess you could say

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:49,199
for open telemetry so that will be um

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,959
creative commons licensed

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:54,480
components about like

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,600
if you have ever had to build a slide

00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,800
deck about a technical system

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,440
you might feel my pain of

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,639
what does the icon for an open telemetry

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,600
collector look like

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,600
or a sdk right like there's all these

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,320
things and we want a way to kind of tell

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,600
people about those things through

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,040
you know iconic iconography

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
so that people can have those shiny

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,240
architecture diagrams except for you

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
know hey this is aws

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,399
s3 this is redis right like instead this

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,000
is an hotel collector right like we need

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,120
that visual library so that people can

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
describe things

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,279
yeah so we're working on those the other

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,440
thing that we definitely have

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,600
had a need for a while um is that we've

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,759
been developing workshops in a box

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,759
for the past year and kind of bringing

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,000
those tours maturity so that more people

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
can

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,120
deliver workshops about open telemetry

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
to the community

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,959
that we can expand our user base uh very

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,399
rapidly is going to be important

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,000
once we're ga yeah uh also

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,680
next year there will be open telemetry

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,399
1.0 i'll have a big party

00:15:53,680 --> 00:16:01,519
hopefully in person and finally

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,199
we've applied for incubation so this is

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,040
a cncf thing

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:07,120
uh incubation basically right now open

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,519
telemetry is a sandbox project

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,199
incubation means that we've basically

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,880
achieved a new milestone in terms of the

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,480
maturity and adoption of the project

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,839
which means we get more resources

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,000
from the cncf and also more credibility

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,360
in the cloud native ecosystem so please

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
look forward for that

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,839
or to that

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,199
and any other big community things

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,720
you're looking forward to this

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,800
no i don't think so i think that covers

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,759
it pretty well all right

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,199
so last thing then i want to give

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,240
everyone a little brief tour of the

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,800
platform and make sure everyone

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,600
understands what they should be doing

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,120
[Music]

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,759
so that you can kind of get the most out

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,680
of this so

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,880
after this next keynote there'll be a

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,800
break and

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
you will be able to go under this main

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,759
stage i'll take you through this in the

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,279
browser in a second but

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,040
there's this uh breakout sessions

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,839
planning and you can suggest a breakout

00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,279
session

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
and you can also vote on breakout

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,160
sessions and

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,799
those votes will tell us as organizers

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,400
like what

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,880
breakout sessions we should have so be

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,959
sure to go do that also if you've done

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
that and you're looking to sort of just

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,799
um have some voice chats or video chats

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,720

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
we have this spatial chat networking so

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,839
this is actually really cool you go

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,679
into this and you kind of have an icon

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,160
and you can move around and see where

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,880
people

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,799
are in this virtual room and chat with

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,360
them it's very neat

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,360
so let me

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,400

and in this you can add a

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,840
thing up here so

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,559

00:17:52,480 --> 00:18:01,840
box

00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,840
i would hit submit and then

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,440
right so i could vote on this

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,440
and the standard rules of open spaces

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,200
apply like you don't have to

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
go to everyone that you vote for you're

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,360

we will try to schedule things

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,559
appropriately yeah so there'll be

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,000
and what will happen is after this uh

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,000
next break before these breakout

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,320
