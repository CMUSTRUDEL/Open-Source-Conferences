00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,560
uh

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,599
session much like the breakout sessions

before uh to keep the conversation going

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,200

um open if you go to our organization on

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,800
github there is a repo called

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,480
community and that contains within it

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
the project structure but it also

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,280
contains link to the calendar

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,200
to find when our meetings are um and

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,560
we do hang out a lot in getter so that's

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
another great place

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,680
uh to ask questions but really we're

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,519
quite active on github getter and

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
our meetings are open to newcomers so

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,080
don't don't feel like just because

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,959
you're new you can't show up to the

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,840
meetings

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,319
so i really want to stress that uh

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,120
especially as we're heading towards

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,800
um release candidates but we're not

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
quite there yet this is really the time

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,800
we want people dog fooding

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
this stuff and uh really giving us

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,040
feedback so

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,720
also big ask is go ahead and try it

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,640
even if the documentation is

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,599
non-existent or not perfect

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
um giving us feedback even on what would

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,799
be most

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,840
helpful there is helpful feedback so

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,680
again

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
because it is super important uh this

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,519
would not be financially possible

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,879
uh without our sponsors i hope everyone

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,519
