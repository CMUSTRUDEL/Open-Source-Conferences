hi everyone welcome to my lightning talk

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:05,520
picking up the telescope

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,080
getting involved in the open telemetry

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,080
community

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,160
so i'm rachel klein i'm a software

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:13,679
engineer at new relic

00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,040
obviously that picture's real old based

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,320
on the length of my hair it's way

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,400
pre-pandemic

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,320
um i'm new to the open telemetry

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,520
community super excited to be presenting

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,359
for you today

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,119
did i mention i'm like really new like i

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,119
just submitted my first couple of pull

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,039
requests in the last few weeks new

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,199
well that is going to be my best asset

00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,800
today as i talk about my experiences

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,760
as a first time contributor and what we

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,760
can all learn from them

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
so who is this talk for first and

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,800
foremost i'm really hoping that there

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,239
are some people listening who want to

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,960
get involved with open telemetry

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,160
community

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,160
haven't done so yet and they're

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,160
wondering about how to get started i'll

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,039
be sharing about my own experiences

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,960
obviously your mileage may vary but as a

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
newcomer i definitely benefited from

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,320
other people talking about their entry

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,559
point and how they got involved and

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,480
i would really like to pay that forward

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,239
secondly anyone who wants to encourage

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,159
newcomers to the community to make

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,360
the open telemetry project stronger is

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,320
my intended audience so

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,320
hopefully everyone

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,360
before we get into how i got involved

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,880
what are some reasons why people

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
might not find it so easy to get

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,280
involved the first reason is that

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,640
the world of open source is not always

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,600
the most welcoming place

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,280
people from historically

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,240
underrepresented groups in tech like

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,080
myself

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,320
can have complicated feelings about

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,079
jumping in i've got a couple of quotes

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,720
here from wikipedia

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
about uh their their entry on diversity

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,159
and open source software

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,200
about some less than welcoming behavior

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,200
that's been present

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,280
in open source communities in the past

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,520
so just kind of that history

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,159
does tend to give people pause sometimes

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,960
about jumping in

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,240
however the open telemetry community has

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,000
acknowledged this which i think is

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,640
really important and shown a sincere

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,960
desire to help everyone feel welcome

00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,320
there's really no easy answers you know

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,479
you can't

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
up front plan how you're going to make

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,000
your community a welcoming one but just

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
having that sincere

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,319
acknowledgement and of the of the issue

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
and a sincere desire to address it is an

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:11,200
essential first step

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,800
and i also wanted to say that once i

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,720
took the plunge my experiences in the

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
community have been very positive so i'm

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,959
really grateful to everyone with whom

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,239
i've

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,840
interacted for being so gracious second

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,040
reason why it might be a little bit

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,480
difficult to get involved is because

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,280
let's face it open telemetry is

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,120
complicated

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,360
i stole this diagram from a new relic

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,120
blog post um

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,040
and definitely the first time that i

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
looked at it i felt confused it can be

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,239
hard to know where to start and it can

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,599
be easy to feel confused i feel like

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,239
that's important to acknowledge as well

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,840
however the confusion that you feel as a

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,200
first-time contributor can actually be

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
an asset to the community

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,599
and we will get into that as we talk

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,760
about my story

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,519
so without further ado let's get into

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,760
how i picked up the telescope so to

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,760
speak

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,239
step zero for me was to get some good

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,159
advice and this is what i hope this talk

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,519
will be for some people

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,120
many of my colleagues at new relic have

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:07,760
been involved with open telemetry for a

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,760
while

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,440
and um kind of looking at their

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
contributions i was curious how they got

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,280
started they were very generous

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,959
in sharing with me what their first

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,840
steps looked like and that was very

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
helpful to me

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,280
so here's some of the helpful tips that

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,040
i heard it's okay to start with

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,640
something that feels small

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,879
like for example a documentation pr

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,040
um asking questions in a pr review

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,400
making grammatical and typo fixes one of

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,319
my colleagues shared with me that that's

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,720
how he first got involved in spec work

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
which

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,200
was surprising to me based on the

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,799
contributions that he's making now

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,879
if you're confused probably others are

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,640
too bring it up

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,720
this goes back to the whole questions

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,840
being an asset thing and that really did

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,480
prove to be true

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,519
for me and the last piece of good advice

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,000
i got was just start

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,000
somewhere

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
so based on that advice now being a

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,680
rubyist myself i took a look at the open

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,799
issues in the open telemetry ruby repo

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,400
and i tried to just start somewhere um i

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,599
figured i might choose a documentation

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,280
vr to start

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,360
because i heard that they are really

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
appreciated by maintainers

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
and it really helps cement my

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
understanding of things to teach about

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
them

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,400
and happily i saw that there were some

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,240
marked good first issues

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,360
in that repo so i decided to pick one

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,800
and run with it

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,919
the one that i ended up going with i

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,440
don't want to get too much into the

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,040
technical weeds in this talk because

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,040
it's not really the point but

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
basically someone wanted to know there

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,880
are some some different kind of basic

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,240
kinds of span processors as part of the

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,560
tracing pipeline

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
and they had run into an issue where

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,440
they had used the wrong one for their

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,880
environment

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,320
and they thought that the documentation

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,360
could use some more clarification on

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
that point

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,199
so i took that as an opportunity to go

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,440
learn more about spam processors

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,000
now i had already read the documentation

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,960
the the specification rather

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,880
the whole tracing spec but it really

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,320
helped to take this one piece and try to

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
go really deep

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,360
to learn about its place in the whole

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,520
pipeline

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,120
and uh the pieces the other pieces of

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,479
the architecture that touched it so just

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,840
looking at this smaller piece of the

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,039
diagram which i stole from the

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
specification

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,560
um as opposed to that whole giant

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
diagram and trying to understand it at

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,960
once

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:27,120
so i took a really close look at that

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,440
section of this stack i read through

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,039
the ruby sdk implementation of it and i

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,800
took a whole lot of notes to try to make

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,880
sure that i understood every aspect of

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,880
it

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,120
it wasn't long before i had a question

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,440
um

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
so the spec defines span processors as

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
responsible for batching and conversion

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,639
of spans

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,919
to exportable representation and passing

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,080
batches to exporters

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,840
so far so good it looks like this

00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,320
diagram that appears in the spec you

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,160
know

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,680
you've got your span processor and it

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,280
passes things off to an exporter okay

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
but then right after that in the spec it

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,280
said each processor registered on tracer

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,440
provider is the start of a pipeline

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,880
that consists of a span processor and

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
optional exporter

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,120
and so the question arose for me if spam

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,479
processor's job is to batch and

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,880
transform spans for

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,039
export when would an exporter be

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,039
optional

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,240
this turned out to be a good question i

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,880
went ahead and reached out to the

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,960
community

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,000
via gitter just to get some initial

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,479
clarification

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
and i got some really fast responses

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,240
people were very friendly

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,840
and the first person who responded

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,080
didn't actually know of any scenarios

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,639
where an exporter would be optional

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,440
but another person who responded in the

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,720
thread

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,880
did and so both i and

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,319
the original responder got to learn

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,039
something and i thought that was really

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,440
neat

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:51,280
that by bringing up my question i helped

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,280
clarify things for myself and others

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,440
so armed with this knowledge i decided

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,840
to go ahead and start a pr

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
um i decided to tackle a few things you

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:00,960
know that that

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,360
question about whether which span

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,120
processors to use in which context

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,360
and i thought it would also clarify the

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,880
scenarios kind of the definition of span

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
processors and the scenarios in which

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,479
they might be used without exporters

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,840
and while i was in the neighborhood i

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,599
decided to make some minor grammatical

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,080
fixes

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,520
and the discussion on this pr is ongoing

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,440
as of this filming it hasn't been merged

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,560
yet it does have one official approval

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
but it's been such an amazing way to

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,919
learn even more

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
so a couple fruitful aspects of the

00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,479
discussion so far people obviously

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
brought up

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,560
some more nuances to the things whose

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,720
definitions i was trying to clarify

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,800
so i was able to make them even better

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,000
um with having comments from a wide

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,960
variety of people throughout the

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,599
community weighing in

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
and then also surprisingly to me those

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,520
grammatical fixes that i made

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,199
ended up being more useful than i

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,919
thought even because

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,599
um since things that i didn't make you

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,960
know substantial

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:03,440
changes to meaning wise um but

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,720
were just grammatical fixes were still

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,240
part of my pr

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
it caused people to take a second look

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,080
at them it got people talking about them

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,240
and we were able to make some needed

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,960
changes clarifications

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,960
there as well

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,400
and then finally i circled back and

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,000
took what i had learned from that

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,240
discussion on my

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
specification pr and made a pr to the

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,919
ruby open telemetry

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,240
implementation which did end up getting

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,279
merged so i feel really happy that i was

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,640
able to help

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,200
clarify things for users of ruby open

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,200
telemetry

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,919
so this all this was a relatively small

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,320
investment of time and effort

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
really not bad um i gained a better

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,959
understanding of open telemetry

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,440
architecture

00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,760
and i was also able to help other people

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,040
understand it better as well

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,000
and really got some good discussion

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,000
started i also gained a knowledge of

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,920
processes you know just how to submit

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,760
things in the correct way

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,920
and i made connections in the community

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,680
so the next time i want to contribute

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,839
something it will be even easier to jump

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,839
in

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,800
so what are the takeaways here for new

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,680
contributors being new actually is an

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,120
advantage

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,519
new eyes on the subject are really

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,880
needed questions

00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,640
oftentimes they're good questions and

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,480
they help clarify things that need to be

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,320
clarified

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,080
also choosing a topic and following your

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
curiosity will take you far it's

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,120
it's a better approach in my opinion

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,839
than trying to understand everything up

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,920
front

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
if you start with just one piece and see

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,760
what is adjacent to it and kind of build

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
out from there you'll learn a ton along

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,320
the way

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,080
and finally i learned that the community

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,200
is very welcoming to newcomers i'm

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,200
really happy to report

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,080
for the community uh thank you for your

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,200
acknowledgment of the fact that open

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,519
source is not always

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,399
a welcome welcoming place please keep

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
that up

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,240
um every interaction that you have

00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
especially with a new person

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,800
is a chance to make things better in a

00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,200
small way for open source as a whole

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,880
so uh like i said i had a really great

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
experience and i think that everyone

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,560
should

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,279
keep up the good work with being

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,880
friendly and welcoming

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,959
and if you've got wisdom to share about

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,399
how you got involved with open telemetry

00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,720
please do share it with others

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,440
it really makes a difference and over

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
time

00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,120
every new person that's added to the

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,240
contributor community makes

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,240
the project stronger

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,440
so thank you so much for the opportunity

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,920
to present today thank you for listening

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,040
thanks to everyone for building a

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,880
welcoming community

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
and i wanted to say a special thank you

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,880
to the specific people

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,480
who helped me as a new contributor

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,760
provided feedback

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,680
advice and clarification and happy open

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
