hello everyone and welcome to the open

00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,080
telemetry colo day at kubecon cloud

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,160
nativecon north america 2020.

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,559
i'm priyanka sharma and i'm the general

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,280
manager of the cloud native computing

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,400
foundation

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,119
or our beloved clc and i'm so

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,480
thrilled to be here today to speak with

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,840
the lead maintainers

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,960
of open telemetry project i personally

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
have a special place in my heart for all

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,800
things observability

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,399
my own journey in cloud native began

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,480
with the open tracing project

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,440
where i worked very closely with ted

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,559
over here

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,760
and also hung out with morgan so i'm

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,520
just excited to see

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,280
all the momentum that has happened over

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,719
the years and the

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,520
great progress we have made till date so

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,160
without further ado let's get started

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,960
and learn more about open telemetry

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:57,520
so first things first ted and morgan

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,399
please introduce yourself

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,039
ted you want to go first ah sure uh yeah

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,320
my name's

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,600
ted young tedsuo online uh if you've

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,760
shown up to almost any open telemetry

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,640
call i'm sure you've seen me around

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
uh my background was uh i've been

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,400
working in

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,280
uh really cloud native uh computing for

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,880
a long time

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,000
it was containers and container

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,720
scheduling uh before this but that

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,240
led me into observability because i just

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
felt like i did not have

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,759
the tools that i needed to really manage

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,680
and debug

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,439
these like mission critical control

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,640
planes that we were building

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,159
and uh we needed something that was

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,360
flexible and could connect to a lot of

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
systems and

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,720
the open tracing project seemed like the

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,360
ideal

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,960
uh the ideal tool that we were missing

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,759
at the time so that's what sort of drew

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,600
me in

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,200
to this world of observability and i

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,119
loved it so much that i went full-time

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,159
on

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,960
and the rest of it history yeah

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,439
sorry god i'm morgan mclean i work at

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,680
google

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,560
uh my history dates back to our cloud

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,960
trace product

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,799
uh and later open census uh which is

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,039
around the same time as open tracing and

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,319
and uh you know i've been involved with

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,920
open census since the beginning and

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,239
certainly with the merger of open census

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,160
and open tracing into open telemetry

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,760
uh and like ted if you've joined

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,440
basically any call

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,959
uh for any of the open telemetry sigs

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160
you've probably seen my face and heard

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,800
my voice and so it's

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,920
great to talk about it today awesome

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
awesome

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,080
so to kick us off for the benefit of the

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
audience i think it'll be helpful

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,840
if you can tell us exactly what open

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,360
telemetry is today

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,400
yeah uh ted do you want me to take that

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,319
yeah do it

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
yeah so open telemetry provides the

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,920
components that you need

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
to capture observability signals from

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,120
your applications and i realize i

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,440
appreciate that's a mouthful

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
um what it really means is we provide

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,720
the sdks and or agents

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,480
uh that capture traces and metrics uh

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
and eventually other signals from your

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
application

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,360
and they'll then send that data to

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,560
various backends for processing and

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,840
analytics nice yeah and

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,560
so you said metrics as well as traces so

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
correct yeah we capture both yeah and i

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,440
mean i don't want to dilute the

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,400
conversation too much we're also working

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,800
on logs

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,159
uh that'll ship far later you know

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,760
midway through next year but

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,560
our ambition is to get as many signal

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,280
types as we can yeah

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,159
yeah i would say like at a meta level uh

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,159
it's not just

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:30,159
uh all of the implementations but it's

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,080
sort of like a language

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,080
uh for being able to describe how

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,280
distributed systems work

00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,680
uh focused on looking at them from a

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,840
transactional point of view

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
and the point of view that we tend to

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,680
want to have when we're trying to debug

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,400
these massive systems

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,799
so that's that's part of what makes it i

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
think

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,879
a little bit distinct in this area from

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,040
other prior projects

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,200
i feel like that's so beautifully said a

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,959
language for describing distributed

00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,360
systems from a transactional point of

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,920
view

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,120
that should be on your website

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,280
remarketing advice

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,439
[Laughter]

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,840
um no you know this really brings me

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,519
back in my head to the open tracing data

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,120
really we were trying to talk about how

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,599
do you understand your system

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,440
which at a certain level of complexity

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,919
no single human being can

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,880
and so what would be really helpful is

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,199
to understand

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
exactly how open telemetry is different

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,160
from open tracing

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,840
as well as open sensors yeah i can take

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,639
a first pass at this so

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,000
i feel like it was sort of like two

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,880
halves of the same

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,919
thing that was what made the merger so

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,759
interesting

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,280
uh on the open tracing side it was

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,400
really focused on

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,280
having the interfaces the main thing we

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,280
were looking at

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,960
trying to share was all of the

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,960
instrumentation when you

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,600
go out there and you try and maintain

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,160
one of these big observability systems

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,840
the the instrumentation is just a huge

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,280
amount of work to keep up with

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,759
and as software has diversified

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,680
over time it's just uh it's becoming

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,039
just more and more software

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,720
that means more and more different kinds

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,199
of instrumentations and there's a

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,520
certain

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,880
point where it just becomes untenable

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
for anyone to

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,120
maintain all of that on their own on top

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
of trying to build some kind of analysis

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,440
tool

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
so what we really wanted to do was

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
figure out a way that we could

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,280
share uh all of this instrumentation

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,080
and be able to have that instrumentation

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,400
ideally be

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,280
native within software rather than

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,360
plugins

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,560
and then be able to plug in any kind of

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,160
analysis tool

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,400
on the back end and so that was sort of

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,600
the direction open tracing came at it uh

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,880
you want to talk about open census

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,240
morgan yeah so open census was similar

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,520
but and yet different right so open

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
tracing was very focused on the

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,360
interfaces and

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,240
and capturing uh as ted mentioned uh

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,639
capturing

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,199
as much instrumentation as it could open

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,880
census was very focused on providing a

00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,080
great out of box experience and so open

00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,120
census included the entire

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,039
implementation

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,319
the the tracer context propagation

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,160
everything else was just there in your

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
language specific sdk

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
uh and open sense census additionally

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,199
also focused on metrics which was a big

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,880
difference from open tracing which was

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,280
as its name suggests very focused on

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,360
tracing uh and i think open telemetry

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,600
brings the best of both of each of these

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,600
right you have in in open telemetry you

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,360
have apis that don't include the

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,120
implementation much like open tracing

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,639
which makes it really easy for framework

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,199
maintainers to buy indicates this

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,639
framework

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,840
that was a challenge in open census it

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,919
was a drawback you had to bring the

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,960
whole implementation with you

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,240
and open telemetry also provides the

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,160
full sdk

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,560
as a separate component that you can

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,960
pull down much like what opencensus had

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,639
and it also includes metrics and so

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,639
really it's just the the ultimate

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,400
marriage of both projects into one

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,000
and plus on top of that it brings a

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
vastly larger community than

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,680
either open census or open tracing ever

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,160
had i think i ran the numbers a few

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,840
months ago it's like 20 times bigger

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,960
than open census and open tracing

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
combined in terms of number of

00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,919
committers

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,599
the last few months we've been the

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,440
second largest or second most active

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,479
cncf project in terms of commits and

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,240
committers

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,400
uh which is huge like if you told me

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,440
that like last year i wouldn't have

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
believed you

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,960
uh and so that's that's another sort of

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
non-technical thing that the project

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
brings is like huge support from the

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,440
industry and end users

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,919
which is fantastic wow that is amazing i

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,039
mean

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,479
yeah twenty thousand contributors

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,160
it's not not twenty thousand

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,479
contributors sorry twenty times the size

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,240
uh

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,319
twenty times the previous number twenty

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919
that's like two thousand percent growth

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
right something like that if i did my

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,680
math right yeah no it's it's

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,360
it's fantastic i mean it's it's kind of

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,039
mind-boggling when we look at the cncf

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,560
dev stats and going yeah that's us

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:45,039
really

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,720
you guys but i i think it speaks to

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,879
the hunger that's existed in the

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,759
industry for this solution and i mean

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,360
certainly

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,479
i know at google and certainly ted for

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,759
yourself at lightstep and all the

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,560
contributors from all the other vendors

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,120
have mentioned

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,560
you get on customer calls and and they

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
see the value immediately and that's why

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
you have

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
i think so many end users like like

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:05,199
shopify

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,720
and others uh and mailchimp and and uh

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,080
postmates and a whole group

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,759
making their own contributions and

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,199
putting teams on this because they see

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,879
the value

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,960
yeah and that's ultimately why we

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,919
decided to merge the projects normally

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,680
it's fine to have

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,840
like a bunch of separate projects in the

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,400
same space it's no big deal but

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,080
uh there's something about uh i think in

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,319
particular the distributed tracing

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
aspect of it but really everyone was

00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
asking

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
for there to be one standard for doing

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
this

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,360
and so we were getting a lot of

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,200
community pressure to

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
merge the projects you know kind of from

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,200
the get-go people were like i don't

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
really want to

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,959
pick between these two things um why why

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
are we

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,120
having this xkcd comic experience

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,120
now there were 11 standards yeah but it

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,600
was like totally validating because when

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,839
we

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,440
merged them so we actually maybe like

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,120
the one group to actually reduce the

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
number of potential standards out there

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,839
by

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,920
going from two to one and when we did

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
that that was what made everyone

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,360
get involved because that was ultimately

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,600
the thing people were looking for

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
was just agreement on how we were going

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
to do this

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,440
yes absolutely i think you have truly

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,760
found product market fit

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,560
and in this case it's standard market

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,360
fit let's

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,240
maybe we'll call it that um but it's i

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,279
think

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,600
as you folks said right this is a merger

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,800
and then some because your community has

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
grown 20x

00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,279
at least you have yes so much more

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,800
momentum and that tells you the sum is

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,480
greater than the parts

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,959
and that's just a beautiful beautiful

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,080
story i i think one thing you folks have

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,600
been saying

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,000
one thread you folks have been talking

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,880
about is around standards and how

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,640
there's like

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,000
always more and more because everyone i

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,320
think to quote something

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,399
morgan said similar but different and

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,480
that's sort of how i think

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,880
n plus one um why does this happen so

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,000
much in standards

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,120
standards are hard uh like right it's

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,600
ultimately about

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,839
organizing people and finding agreement

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,120
and when there's less people around it's

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,880
easier to find

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,959
agreement that's just one of the things

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,120
about you know having a diverse

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,880
coalition is you have to do the work

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,880
it's real work to actually come up with

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
something that makes everyone happy and

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,200
satisfied

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,519
and that's always going to be slower

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,680
than just kind of going off on your own

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,920
and you know taking a shot at it

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,160
uh so it's it's it's always going to be

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,720
a longer process and we certainly saw

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,279
you know open telemetry i think probably

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,640
doing this merger probably added a year

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,959
onto our timeline uh at least uh but

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,800
you know that's that's just why

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,120
standards end up taking time

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
even even simple standards like uh it's

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,399
technically a separate standard separate

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,040
project but if you look at w3c

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,360
trace context which is basically all the

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,839
same participants as open telemetry but

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
it's

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,240
just for the http header that's used to

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,880
propagate trace context that's it

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,600
very simple just a little string that

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,079
took

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,760
about a like we had sort of drafts going

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,200
between like google and zipkin for a

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
while and then we brought it into the

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,399
w3c or actually dynatrace who helped us

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200
bring it in

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,079
um and once that happened progress did

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,839
slow

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,600
not in a bad way but just because yeah

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,519
everybody's there like you need to meet

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
everyone's requirements now and so

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,640
that just naturally takes a lot of time

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,720
it's it's good

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,839
like it's bad it's good about it it's

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
bad because it slows things down but

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,240
it's good because in the end now

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,519
everyone's going to support it

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
right and it actually meets everyone's

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,800
needs and that's just the nature of the

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,440
beast when it comes to standards

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,279
yeah i think you're absolutely right um

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,480
a standard is just different because

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,200
it's

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,079
very opinionated and very specific uh

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
yeah actually

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,760
and that has i don't think the

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,760
difference in pace

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,680
is by any means a bad thing as you said

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,600
you added time to your

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,200
roadmap but now you've come out with

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,680
something stronger that people really

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,839
love

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,639
and something actually used like right

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,320
yeah useful

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,399
and so that's just like it seems like

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,320
observability is that kind of space that

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,160
needed this type of effort

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
i have actually had my own brush with

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,760
standards lately because

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,000
uh we're working on an inclusive naming

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,760
initiative for all of um

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,360
not just the ncf but leveraging the

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,600
kubernetes uh

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,880
project's work and removing problematic

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,519
language and code

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,800
and the clear knowledge a clear thing we

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,079
were told you have to work with

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
standards because

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,000
there are aspects of software that have

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,519
to be determined in that way

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,920
and when you went to talk to them it was

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,360
like oh yeah a very fast thing will be

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,880
like probably two years

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,399
because it's like wait what that's

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,000
and these are the software standards

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,920
like i i feel

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
for people who do standards in like the

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,480
electrical or mechanical engineering or

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,560
civil engineering like

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,240
that takes way longer yeah

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,660
so you guys are blazing fast as a

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,440
standard

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:55,120
[Laughter]

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,320
the fastest turtle yep exactly exactly

00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,240
so amazing stuff i think myself i and

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
uh the audience has learned a lot about

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
the history of open telemetry all the

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
value that it's brought

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,800
i think now we would like to learn from

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,560
you about

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,639
where is uh what is your latest update

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,639
from open telemetry to end users

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,200
potential contributors out there

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,800
yeah so i can speak to that a bit uh so

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,240
we recently had an announcement that the

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,120
tracing specification

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,680
has reached release candidate status and

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
so the sdks are all working away right

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,360
now

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,360
on building their own release candidates

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,440
for tracing obviously the sdks include

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,360
tracing and metrics and other things

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,519
but the tracing part of each of these

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
sdks once they hit hit release candidate

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,120
status

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,360
will be rc and uh we'll have the intent

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,880
and

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,399
and i think we'll need this of ensuring

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
there's no breaking changes between that

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,279
release candidate and the final ga

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,440
version

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,320
after that uh we're actually in parallel

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,160
to that

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
we're working on achieving a release

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,320
candidate specification for metrics

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,079
followed by then the sdks achieving

00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,440
release candidate status for tracing and

00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,959
metrics together

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,040
at which point we'll declare the project

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
to be release candidate status

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,560
uh following that then we'll work uh

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,120
very hard towards getting to ga that's

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,160
mostly like bug fixes productionization

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,160
testing documentation and so we're

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:15,040
expecting pretty broad adoption once the

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,760
project hits

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,560
rc for both tracing and metrics and

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,560
what's the timeline for rc and g8

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
no one's going to hold you to it yeah

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,199
we've been very optimistic earlier this

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,399
year i'm probably more guilty than

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,440
anyone about that

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,720
i'm i'm hoping we can get rc for both by

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,120
the end of this year we'll see

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,839
that's that's not a guarantee both and

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,760
then both

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,240
tracing and metrics yeah you're going to

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,680
see release candidate sdks for tracing

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,240
in the next few weeks like that that's

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,959
that's well underway that's fast the rc

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,839
release

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,320
of the tracing spec i think it's

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,680
hopefully probably achievable this year

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,399
we're going to push really hard towards

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,800
that the rc release for

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,240
tracing and metrics both in the sdks is

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,360
possibly achievable this year again

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
we're going to push really hard to try

00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,920
and get that we

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
we may or may not we'll see it's

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,199
debatable right uh g8 would

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,600
definitely be easier yeah yeah ga is

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,600
obviously

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,240
okay so you folks are saying that my

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,920
next cube gone you you will have a ga

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,360
product did i get that

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:19,360
yes we've done this

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,680
rc yes exactly so it will definitely

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,440
have rc's well before

00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,800
kubecon eu the rcs i expect to be used a

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,440
lot of places in production

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,560
like i i'm curious how many vendors are

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,759
certified i'm guessing a lot of them

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,360
will but

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,839
um ga hopefully by next year but to be

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,320
blunt

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
for most users that probably won't

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,880
matter

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,480
because i'm expecting pretty broad

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,920
adoption of the rc's just given the

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,040
amount of contributions we've seen from

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,480
end users

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
great one imagines they're not going to

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
make all those contributions and then

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,279
sit and wait for a label to tell them

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,600
they can use it

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,440
yeah and i would add there there is

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,920
actually an important time frame right

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,880
now

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,199
which is because uh the tracing spec is

00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,399
now

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,120
frozen and we have not yet

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,560
issued a release candidate now is the

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,839
time to really

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,880
dog food uh and try this out so

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,320
uh getting involved and making sure that

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,240
it feels ergonomic

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,920
that that everything is uh working

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,720
properly that we don't want to make any

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,639
changes

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,079
you know on the individual language

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,160
levels uh

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,000
this is the time to be doing that work

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,560
so i would encourage anyone

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,920
you know who's watching this uh to give

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,240
open telemetry a try

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,160
now and start giving us feedback before

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,959
those rc's come out

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,759
amazing and so the call to action here

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,600
is

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,040
go check out the open telemetry

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,920
libraries

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:47,120
for various languages and give feedback

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,399
because the

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,920
rc is coming soon and um one thing i

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,839
think would be helpful just for you know

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,079
first time attendees as well as

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
you know some end users and contributors

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,800
is to really understand what you mean

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,360
when you say

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,480
rc is coming it's great i think that

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,240
would help them

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,000
feel more comfortable going forward

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,280
before g8 so would you please

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,559
explain that one of you sure uh rc just

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,839
means release candidate

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:17,120
so what we want to do is lock down

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,079
in particular the public api so open

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,280
telemetry

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,240
uh differentiates between the apis that

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,120
end users use to instrument their code

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,679
versus

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,559
um what's happening under the hood and

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,559
sdk

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,400
framework api so we have you know

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,520
typical framework stuff around life

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,640
cycle hooks and

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,919
um things of that nature but the stuff

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,400
that really needs

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,640
uh to remain stable and backwards

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,559
compatible very very strictly

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
are the public apis because if you look

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,240
at the amount of code

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
that's going to be written against those

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,600
apis that it's just

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,960
monstrous compared the amount of code

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,039
that would be written against say

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,240
you know our framework apis and that

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,640
code has to be stable

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,280
because if we we break that in some way

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,600
we're going to be breaking a lot of code

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,520
and so we want to have a strict

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,400
long-term support guarantee around that

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,480
public api

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,600
so that's the part we really really want

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,400
to nail

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,480
um and that's to my mind like the heart

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
of what the release candidates in ga is

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,720
about

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,400
is saying like this has reached a

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,640
stability point where we think

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,559
we're just going to leave it this way

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,600
and we might add things to it later but

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,640
we're not going to break

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,440
this so uh that's why it's so important

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,400
for people to

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,799
to give it a shot right now awesome so

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,840
go out there and try this out and give

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,480
them feedback

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:39,440
they've organized a whole cola for you

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,640
to get you to do that

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,160
so speaking of uh colos um

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,080
there's a lot of stuff happening right

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,799
uconn is so full of energy and

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,039
excitement

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,480
and i'm proud to say actually compare

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,320
compared to our first

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,320
first rev with the virtual event this

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,720
time i think people have got

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,400
been able to work with the virtual event

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,559
and made it strategic for themselves

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,000
we're having polos like this we're doing

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,720
inclusive naming meetings etc etc so

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
people the demands on people's time is

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,760
hi

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,600
what would you recommend folks who are

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,480
watching this right now to definitely

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,280
attend

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,840
in order to build their understanding of

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:20,799
cloud native systems

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,480
uh we'll definitely uh attend open

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:25,840
telemetry community day so

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,840
you've already checked that box

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,000
but yeah stay tuned we do have

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,640
um after this we're going to be going

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,600
into

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,919
uh workshops like unconference style

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,120
conversations and so that's a great way

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,960
to really get out there and get your

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,799
questions answered because we have a lot

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,440
of maintainers and community members

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,360
here

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
uh and i love unconferences that's the

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,600
part i'm most excited about

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,480
uh morgan there do you have anything

00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,960
beyond that you think

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,919
we have some cool talks uh also

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,520
occurring that

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,880
i mean it's a single track so if you're

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,120
if you're here and don't change the

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,600
channel i said you're gonna stick around

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,320
um uh there's definitely a few talks

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,520
where uh

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,280
i read the summary and they look pretty

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,080
interesting so i'm excited to listen to

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,080
them and

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,080
a number of them are by actual like end

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,360
users who are using open telemetry in

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,440
production and so you can understand

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,120
even from their experience in the beta

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,720
how things have gone pitfalls they've

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,559
ran into and how the project has

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,960
improved and evolved since then

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,799
oh that's amazing i mean it's if the end

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,559
user is telling their stories that's the

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,120
way to go and i'm so proud to hear

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,880
that you have that um i also think you

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,640
have amazing maintainers and

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,559
collaborators on your project one of

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,880
whom is constance

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,240
uh i always say her last name wrong so

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,200
i'm not gonna try

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,559
but uh constance is actually co-chair

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,480
for all of kubecon

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,840
this time around and she's a part of the

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,679
hotel community

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,080

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
eastern time

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,880
and so you can listen to her as well as

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,960
one of the uh

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,320
hard-working collaborators on open

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,480
telemetry

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,960
um with all that said just final

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,840
question folks obviously we've learned a

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,600
lot we know

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,039
about the history of open telemetry to

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,400
some degree we know

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,480
about the release candidate that's

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,600
coming soon but i'm sure lots of folks

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,559
have questions

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
where can they find you and i have

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:20,000
trained you to give the right answer

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:23,120
on this one so so during the conference

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,240
uh you can uh find us and i think any

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,280
conference attendees

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,400
and priyanka on slack on the cncf slack

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,240
specifically

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,919
i do know like open telemetry we we

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,760
actually tend to use gitter

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,280
oh that's great for the long term yeah

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,480
but but yeah and we

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,480
there's been debates about switching

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,159
this internally there too but but for

00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,039
the purposes of this conference uh it

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,320
sounds like there will be a lot of

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,080
conversations on slack and

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,760
slack and we'll be participating there

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,640
uh generally uh

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,919
so so beyond uh cubecon this year then

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,200
we're active on getter

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,400
uh like i said that might be moving to

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,559
slack eventually there'll be an

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,600
announcement about that when it happens

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,520
on github and during the weekly

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,799
special interest group meetings uh to be

00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,159
honest like if you really want to get

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,840
involved and understand the pace of the

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,760
product or the project rather

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,280
then the weekly sig meetings which are

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,960
in our public calendar are open to

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,360
anyone i really recommend joining

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,400
there's

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,080
great discussions that happen there and

00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,440
on the weekly maintainers meeting we go

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,480
over the project status every monday

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,480
morning

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,320
and so that's the the fastest and

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,919
easiest way both to introduce yourself

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,960

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,440
