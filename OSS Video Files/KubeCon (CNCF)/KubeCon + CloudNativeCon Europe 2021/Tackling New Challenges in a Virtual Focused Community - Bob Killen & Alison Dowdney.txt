Tackling New Challenges in a Virtual Focused Community - Bob Killen, Google & Alison Dowdney, Weaveworks

The pandemic has had many communities scrambling to find ways to capture, grow, and continue to strengthen the bonds of their community members. Virtual events, zoom burn out, and increased familial responsibilities are things that are impacting not only contributors but software communities as a whole. They do pose an opportunity - They can be made more accessible, there are less financial pressures for attendees, and they open up possibilities for others that might not be able to previously contribute to open source. In this talk, we’ll go over some of the successes and failures that we have encountered over the past year, share our experiences, and explore strategies to mitigate “virtual” fatigue. Attendees will learn the following things: - How to approach virtual events and activities, both as an organizer and an attendee - Set and manage expectations with themselves and others - Technical do’s and don’ts with virtual events
