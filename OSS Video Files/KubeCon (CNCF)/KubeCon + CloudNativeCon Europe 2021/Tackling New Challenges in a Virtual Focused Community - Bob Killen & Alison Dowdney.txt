Tackling New Challenges in a Virtual Focused Community - Bob Killen, Google & Alison Dowdney, Weaveworks

The pandemic has had many communities scrambling to find ways to capture, grow, and continue to strengthen the bonds of their community members. Virtual events, zoom burn out, and increased familial responsibilities are things that are impacting not only contributors but software communities as a whole. They do pose an opportunity - They can be made more accessible, there are less financial pressures for attendees, and they open up possibilities for others that might not be able to previously contribute to open source. In this talk, we’ll go over some of the successes and failures that we have encountered over the past year, share our experiences, and explore strategies to mitigate “virtual” fatigue. Attendees will learn the following things: - How to approach virtual events and activities, both as an organizer and an attendee - Set and manage expectations with themselves and others - Technical do’s and don’ts with virtual events

hello and welcome to

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,399
tackling new challenges in a virtual

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,759
focused community an exploration of

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,759
virtual community management

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,840
i'm alison i'm a developer advocate at

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,800
weaveworks

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,119
and i'm a co-chair of kubernetes sig

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,119
contributor experience

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,160
my name is bob killen mr hobby tables

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,880
across all the things

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,920
i'm a program manager at google i'm a

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,119
member of the kubernetes steering

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,880
committee and

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,279
also a co-chair of sick contributor

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,000
experience

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,440
now before we kick this off i do sort of

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,120
want to go into

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,079
why this is important well everyone is

00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,320
virtual now we

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,600
are forced to have more asynchronous

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,360
communication

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,879
but open source has been you know mainly

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,399
remote forever so

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,079
we as open source contributors and

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,360
maintainers should be positioned

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,199
quite well to deal with this sort of

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,879
thing how come we're running into

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,640
problems now

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,399
we should you know we should really be

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,199
experts at working

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,000
working virtually now right many people

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,520
and companies

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
are honestly grappling with becoming

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,080
remote all at once there's greater

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,640
isolation

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,320
more meetings and it all adds up and it

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,439
leads to sort of like many

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,280
negative experiences so we've adopted

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,880
some strategies to help like mitigate

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,960
and come back the combat these issues

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,880
reduce the zoom fatigue strengthen our

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,320
community bonds and in many cases we've

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,159
made participating

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:28,799
way more accessible

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,680
so you're probably wondering how are we

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,640
going to share

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,680
our experiences with you today well

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,799
fortunately

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,400
kubernetes has become so popular that it

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,439
has its own spin-off

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,360
located entirely within this slide deck

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,640
this spin-off includes a book and a

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,280
television series

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,000
that follows two fictional maintainers

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,520
in a large

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,600
open source project called nottinetti's

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,720
today we will be reading a story from

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
the book and watching an

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
episode from the television series and

00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
then

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
following up with some of our own

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
commentary and

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,240
things that were missed out by the

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,280
writers so

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,200
let us begin the notonity storybook

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,480
narneties is one of the largest open

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,040
source projects out there

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,440
with over 56 000 unique contributors in

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,920
a whopping 300 plus repos

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,879
with that larger project it is busy and

00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
they have over

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,440
200 meetings a month and honestly people

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,959
are tired

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,720
but with with all that sort of out of

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,239
the way let's actually kick it off and

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,599
meet our two fictional maintainers

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,840
i'm fiona and i'm

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
frank

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,760
okay today there is a meeting for the

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,840
knotted eddies project

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,480
let's join in on the call good evening

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,840
everyone uh

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:56,879
it's just us again it's just us again

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,680
the participants list empty confirming

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:03,360
the lack of attendees fiona and frank

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,519
the only people to be seen

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
how do we solve this problem what tools

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,280
do we have

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,519
how else do we communicate we can use

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,959
slack

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,440
so pausing here for just a moment

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,879
um sort of go over the like slack

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,000
meetings and

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,159
some tips for us that have been a bit

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
more helpful slack or

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,040
chat based meetings can be quite

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
effective even for more than just

00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,879
regular touch points

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
this is first like by providing a

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,840
multi-day period for people to respond

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,040
it lets them tune in when they can

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,599
between their other responsibilities

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,640
now discussion still occurs and it may

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,040
just be like

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,000
a few hours between responses but that's

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,680
okay

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,200
this is also a huge win for

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,200
international contributors

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,239
they can be actively involved without

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,280
having to be up

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
at all hours of the day something else

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,400
that is honestly really helped us is

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,560
slack threads

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
having a thread per agenda item keeps

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
things very focused and people can watch

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,239
the specific things they're interested

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,239
in

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
now with many more things vying for

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,879
people's attention giving people more

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
ways to sort of like

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,439
manage their focus has proven to be very

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,320
effective

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,000
now after the slack meeting concludes

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
the threads also make it like easier for

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,079
us to summarize the discussion

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,600
uh for the notes and we then take those

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,840
notes and send them out to the main list

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
so that anyone uh that didn't miss it

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,160
can stay informed

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,080
honestly one thing we found is like very

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
few people do wind up going and read the

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,720
notes directly

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,120
but if you can send them notes they'll

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,919
actually read them

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,240
now this last tidbit is important and it

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,520
is

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,840
hard no decisions should be made in

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,720
something that is ephemeral that goes

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,160
for either chat

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,240
or video meetings those should really go

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,040
to your list as an independent item with

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,199
lazy with a lazy consensus period

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,120
lazy consensus is essentially giving a

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,000
decision a comment period if there are

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,680
concerns

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,360
that can't be resolved then the decision

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,520
itself is postponed

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,639
and this gives everyone an opportunity

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,520
to review

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,479
and get their word in now with that

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,880
let's return to the story

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,479
what a great idea let's try it and see

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,400
how things go

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,680
the next meeting is a slack meeting will

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,840
it be a success

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,440
our maintainers create the meeting

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,360
threads

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,479
over the next few hours contributors

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,560
worldwide chime in

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,520
at different times when it suits them a

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,520
day and a half later

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
the meeting ends the next big part of

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,199
fiona and frank's

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,800
frank's work then begins they comb

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
through the meeting threads some rising

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,280
points made

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,880
in an email to the mailing list the

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
information is relayed

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,360
now a week after the slack meeting our

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,880
contributors gather again

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,440
slack call where will we find them

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,880
as the meeting types alternate and last

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
week we use slack

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,360
this week's should be a call let's join

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,600
in on that

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,520
at first glance you can see a big change

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,560
the number of participants is greater

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,400
than two

00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,759
our chairs are filled with excitement

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,840
about the discussions that will

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,720
ensue the slack meetings had a lot of

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,919
engagement

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,600
con from contributors far and wide a big

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
improvement from the live meetings

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
with only a small number of people

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
inside

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,680
what are the contributors thoughts about

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
using slack meetings do they think it's

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,440
a good idea

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,160
let's look at the responses that should

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,520
make things clear

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,400
thank you for this i haven't been able

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,319
to attend due to a work conflict

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,800
i don't have to stay up past midnight

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,080
anymore the regular list updates have

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,759
really helped me stay up to date with

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,600
what's happening

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,800
i'm busy getting my kids ready for

00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,400
school regularly

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,400
the slack meetings have been great

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,000
and with meetings improved and zoom

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,720
fatigue at bay

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,440
the nottonetti's project continues yet

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,639
another day

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,919
so chat based meetings can

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,759
improve your contributor accessibility

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,680
um open source communities are

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,880
a globally distributed teams and

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,639
asynchronous by nature

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,280
but there are a few interesting things

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,599
that really sort of happen as they grow

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,680
now in the beginning they all rely on

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,440
like manless forms and issues

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,440
but once they reach a certain size they

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,319
tend to adopt chat which is a little bit

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,400
more synchronous

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,720
and a much more social but can generally

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,240
still be treated as async

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,960
the next step up sort of like on the

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,639
rung is well they tend to have meetings

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,720
and they're high bandwidth and they do

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,840
serve a purpose they're honestly like

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
great to knock out and discuss important

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,639
topics

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,319
also this is a little bit of a point

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,280
contention and whether it's true or not

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
is who knows

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,800
but having regular meetings is often

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,240
associated with project maturity

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,000
the other thing is like these meetings

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,639
can actually be great for growing your

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,879
community

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,000
they provide a way for people to get to

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,800
know each other

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,680
putting a face with a name and talking

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,280
to people helps

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,199
strengthen your community bonds but

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,639
as an unintended consequence they often

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
become exclusionary

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,960
decisions are made in meetings follow-up

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,080
items are not communicated broadly

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,759
and with a global team no matter

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,080
what you're excluding someone unless

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,879
they really like to stay up late

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,400
now even if people are in the same time

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,759
zone they may have to like pick up their

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
kids from school and can't make a

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
meeting regularly

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,680
um the other things like it can also be

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
incredibly intimidating to chime in on a

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,120
call

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,200
especially for those from

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,800
underrepresented groups or if they're

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,800
new contributors

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,720
um the meetings are you know also

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,279
recorded and published for transparency

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
purposes

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,560
but some people are really uncomfortable

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,880
with having their face recorded and

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,279
posted on the internet

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,320
so you don't know people's experience in

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
history

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
and you can sort of like start to see

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,839
why having like regular video meetings

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,320
could potentially be a

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,320
problem

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,680
with those points in mind here are some

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,880
tips for your open source

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,640
meetings so you can still have your

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,800
meetings but make sure you can be

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,760
accommodate those contributors that

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,120
might not be able to join in regularly

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,279
and use what tools you have to available

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,399
to find a happy path

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,839
so for example um

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,160
we were quite creative with the

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,959
communications mediums we had and we

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,720
used slack

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,080
to do the meetings

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,920
so also many projects create additional

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,160
meetings for different regions

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
europe north america asia pacific to

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,800
give them a space at a time that is

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,800
convenient to them

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,320
and to make them feel included the

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,839
intent is often

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,200
well met the intent is often

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:57,920
like good but can actually backfire

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,760
so more often than not both groups wind

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,880
up being siloed not knowing what the

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,279
other is doing

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,440
wherever the majority is can often

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,120
steamroll the other groups and fall into

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
the pattern of making decisions without

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,440
engaging with everyone

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,440
you can do it but be sure that there is

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,160
enough frequent communication between

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,839
the groups

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,200
so that they're aware of what each other

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,120
is doing

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,120
you can also mitigate some of these

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,800
problems by scheduling ad hoc meetings

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,680
for specific topics with the right

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,600
people

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,440
if it means a person or two staying up

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,240
super late for a one-off or a regular

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,920
discussion

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
it's way better that is much better than

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,680
having a recurring meeting that involves

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
folks staying up till 2 a.m

00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,200
keep meetings for discussions not

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
decisions decisions should go to the

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,560
mailing list where people can respond

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,320
asynchronously

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,079
not everyone may have the bandwidth to

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,040
attend meetings even if they are

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,760
on slack by using the mailing list for

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,680
decisions

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,760
it goes straight to their email the

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
mailing list also serves as a decision

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
register too

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,839
always follow up with an email to the

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
mailing list with the meeting notes

00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,839
keeps people informed and makes the

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
content searchable for people subscribed

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,800
to it

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,839
make it a task of the note taker or the

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,680
meeting post

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,880
just make sure that they exist in the

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
place

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
that people will see it if there's any

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
big action items or follow-up items

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,880
putting them at the top of the email

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,839
will also help visibility

00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,760
also keeping everyone informed is key

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,000
and can drastically help reduce the need

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,040
for

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,200
extra meetings also most open source

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,760
projects are on the free tier of slack

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,600
which deletes message history so by

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,600
sending the notes to the mailing list

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,959
you're creating a searchable archive for

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,480
other contributors

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:50,800
welcome back to the not an eddie show

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,800
episode 2 virtual events

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,800
hey can you send off this week's meeting

00:11:53,040 --> 00:12:00,480
threads

00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,480
sure thing all done

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,760
later that day

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,000
i wonder how the meeting threads are

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
going

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,839
you know it'd be awesome if we could

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,880
have like a virtual contributor summit

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,880
like we do at not con

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,600
there's a lot of chatter about this idea

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:27,839
oh i miss everybody

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,279
i'm sick of recording talks

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,680
i only want to do an event if it's all

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,680
social

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,839
no more screens just just make it

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839
informal so there's no

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
commitment

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,399
do you think of this idea frank we do a

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,519
celebration

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,639
instead of a summit we celebrate our

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,880
contributors

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,920
rather than doing one of those virtual

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,519
conference things

00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:00,320
uh yeah no talks just

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,040
fun that sounds awesome can you toss it

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,040
in the slack thread

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,279
celebrations over summers virtual events

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,760
can be great they can be accessible

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,920
but people truly miss the hallway track

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,880
they miss the social aspects of meeting

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,320
in person

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,800
don't make it hard for people to

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
participate for these type of events

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
where the socialists focus

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,160
let people invite their friends and

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,200
family or give them some way to interact

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,360
with each other

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,519
you can still have technical educational

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,160
content but don't neglect the social

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
side of things

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
instead of summiting we should get

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,120
together and celebrate our wonderful

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,959
contributors

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,800
look at the time it's time to close all

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
those meeting fritz can you gather all

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,480
the notes please and then fire them off

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,839
to the mailing list frank

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
sure thing

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,639
what game should we play today i have an

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:58,399
idea for the contributor celebration

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,399
we could have a game night in the notter

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,760
daddy's discord

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,519
that would be a perfect idea

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,199
you know that sounds awesome but how do

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
we involve the people who don't play

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,440
games

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,360
you know we could stream our games but

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,920
it still might not be that fun for them

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
to watch

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,279
well if streaming games is like tv to

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,079
gamers

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,040
what would be like tv to contributors

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,959
what's something

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,680
everyone can relate to something

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,880
everyone does

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,880
they eat they eat

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,839
next wreak rolls around and fiona and

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,199
frank are sharing their idea

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,959
on the weekly contributor call

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,600
so last week in the slack meeting we

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,920
mentioned a contributor celebration

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
we'll use discord as a space for folks

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,639
to hang out

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:52,320
and have fun activities such as a baker

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,800
so what's discord discord

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,560
is a chat service similar to slack but

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,040
it's designed honestly with communities

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,079
in mind first it was originally targeted

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,000
towards gamers

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,680
but has now grown to support many other

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,199
groups

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,199
discord itself they have really gone on

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:09,920
their way to make it an accessible

00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,240
platform as well as a very safe space

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,639
with

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,279
strong moderation capabilities you can

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,839
do things

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,279
too like require people to you know

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,079
agree to your server rules or abide by

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
your code of connect

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,360
before joining your server the other

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,519
thing in discord

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,639
voice and video aren't second class

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,279
citizens it has

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,639
strong support for both and they've also

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
added some newer features that sort of

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,600
like make it closer to like something

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,279
like zoom or webex

00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
with a presentation mode that can make

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,440
it easier to host these sort of events

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,440
in there

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,240
discord sounds like a great place to

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,240
host this event

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:51,920
montage time epic montage time

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,519
people working together getting things

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,240
done

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:59,360
let's launch this today's the day we've

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
been waiting for a fault

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,800
so tweets are fired and people are

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,839
turning up

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,480
and the team is helping folks who get

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,399
stuck

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,839
get unstuck please help

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,839
let me see what i can do

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,040
people really enjoyed sharing pictures

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,199
of their pets

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,279
in the pets channel and these are all

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,920
the pets

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,920
so small

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,639
have different ways for people to

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,279
participate

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,160
having multiple mediums of communication

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,639
gives people

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,519
more way to more ways to engage with

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,759
each other

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,000
it also gives them the opportunity to

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,079
enjoy the event on their own terms

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,240
for instance some folks might be

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,920
exhausted with social interactions

00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,720
but still want to engage with the main

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,880
event by providing a stream on youtube

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,120
they can watch along without without

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,399
having to worry about joining a call or

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,920
registering for

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,600
yet another service also by having

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,000
topic focused channels

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,480
it gives folks an easy way to break the

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,199
ice instead of

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,079
awkward silences people had a topic to

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,079
talk about

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,839
all these different topics can create

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,720
many different watercolours for people

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,720
to gather around

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,240
all right in 30 minutes our first plant

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,439
event will begin it's trivia time

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,439
are we ready folks

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,280
everyone's turning up to watch the main

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,919
events across discord youtube and twitch

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,080
so this is uh this is trivia this trivia

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,840
with a very low production budget

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,200
so um uh use your imagination

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,880
to see the other

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,400
squares yeah i can share my appreciation

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,679
with others

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,679
i'm on the show too

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,160
and with that comes a close to the

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,200
contributor

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
celebration if you could fill out the

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,240
survey

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,480
that would be awesome so

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,520
you are probably wondering about some of

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,080
the things that the

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,320
writers of the show happen to leave out

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,200
like most television shows based on real

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
life events

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,240
it's not quite the whole story well

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,480
fortunately

00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,080
both of us are here to present with all

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,799
the things that actually happened in the

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,640
project

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,799
in fact we worked with the writers of

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,320
the show not allison and

00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:35,919
not bob two totally not

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,080
fictional writers so anyway

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,039
earlier you saw the contributors in the

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,840
show suggest

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,120
events that they wanted in the

00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,960
celebration but we didn't cover

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,039
all the thoughts and ideas when it came

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:51,039
to selecting the events

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,559
so like i said earlier there should be a

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,640
similar to a point i made earlier there

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,960
should be a non-sign up way to access

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,760
main events doing this improves

00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,840
engagement

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,760
for example the great cloud native bake

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,200
off is one of the top videos on our

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,440
youtube video

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,240
also despite the event occurring on

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,520
discord

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,240
we had 2600 people tune into the event

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,480
streams

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,880
over the weekend of the contributor

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,039
celebration

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,720
social should be a priority but having

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,840
engaging technical content

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,600
can also work very effectively at the

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,600
summit one of our contributors

00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,679
laurie apple ran a tea and time

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,799
management workshop that wound up going

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,400
a full over

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:35,520
it's a full hour over its a lot of time

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,360
due to a larger amount of participants

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,640
even though that was more technical or

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,240
skill focused

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,240
it was very engaging

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,840
so awards and raffles so if you can

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,960
backing up your virtual event with some

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,880
physical items

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
such as awards can help people feel

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,400
connected

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,400
and you can also use that to incentivize

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,160
greater communication

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
we had a reward bot that would send

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,320
people a code to the cncs store

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,039
so that they could get a shirt or a

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,520
hoodie the reward bot would also reward

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,919
those

00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,000
that participated more and we turned up

00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,679
the frequency in which it would give

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,400
out prizes during our main events

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,120
one caveat though international shipping

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,840
can be a

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,200
huge pain even if it's outsourced some

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,080
countries it's just

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,760
very difficult so ships items too in

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,360
these scenarios if you can

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,520
try and find something in their own

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,559
country or as a worst case scenario

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,400
you can even do a gift card so

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,480
when we gathered feedback from the event

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,559
people really liked it we received

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,919
pretty much um non-stop positive

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,400
feedback

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,200
and 85 percent of our survey respondents

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,960
um

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,960
actually really wanted us to do another

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,280
event and only 15

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,640
or the remaining 15 was actually split

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,880
between maybes

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,159
and depends on the pandemic there was

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
not a single

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,240
no virtual events uh like this are more

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,799
broadly accessible

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,080
and we actually um had a few like long

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,600
time contributors who have never been

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,960
able to attend a kubecon

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,400
or contributor summit show up this was

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,720
actually because of like financial or

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,200
geopolitical reasons but the event gave

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,200
them

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,799
an opportunity to actually get to know

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,120
their fellow contributors and sort of

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,720
like

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,720
really brought the community closer

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:21,360
together

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,880
uh the water cooler aspect of the like

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,559
off-topic channels

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,480
also allowed like a few new contributors

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,120
to break out of their shell it was like

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
a very

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,760
neutral icebreaker we had one that

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,799
actually popped into play like destiny 2

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,039
with a bunch of us

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,000
and that was their first real experience

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,480
with the community itself

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,320
others like fired up games of like among

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,679
us and brought their kids along to play

00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,440
it was great

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,080
and it's these little things that keep

00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:52,080
people engaged and especially now like

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:54,320
bring people together so to recap on

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,480
some of the points that we've made

00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,760
chat meetings can improve contributor

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,440
accessibility

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,360
the people who are in different time

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,240
zone people who might have bad internet

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,640
connections

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,280
people who might be uncomfortable with

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
calls

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,520
they now have more ways to participate

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,120
in the community

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,760
be creative with the communication

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,440
mediums you have leverage slant zoom and

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,080
mailing lists to

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,960
provide a way for everyone to be able to

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,000
participate

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,760
in a meeting so give people multiple

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,840
pathways to engage

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,679
similar to what i said just before about

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,559
the communication platforms

00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,520
leverage text video and streams for your

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,039
virtual events

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,520
this will make your event more

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,559
accessible and inclusive

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,240
and last but not least do not

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,039
neglect the social side of your

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,120
community better social bonds means

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,640
people are more comfortable around each

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,080
other

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,080
and when people are more comfortable

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,799
around each other they work together

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,039
better

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,960
they're more likely to to reach out for

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,240
help um

00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,520
also all work and no play can be quite a

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,120
drain

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,120
thank you very much for watching our

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,320
presentation if you're watching this

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,520
live we will now be doing a short q a
