The Long, Winding and Bumpy Road to CronJob’s GA - Maciej Szulik, Red Hat & Alay Patel, Red Hat

The CronJob API just reached GA, and the new controller is solving all the performance and reliability problems of the past. Come join us to learn about the 6 year journey that got us here! We will talk about the people who sparked the discussions and delivered the initial implementation. We will cover all the major problems that users were faced to handle over the years. Finally, we will discuss the solutions and our gratitude to the users and developers standing behind this part of Kubernetes. Maciej (one of the co-authors of CronJob) and Alay (developer of the new controller) will try to squeeze as much as possible in 30 minutes: - From scheduled jobs, through jobs, to cron jobs - Evolution of the API - Known issues with the old controller implementation - Performance boost and improvements in the new controller - Possible future improvements
