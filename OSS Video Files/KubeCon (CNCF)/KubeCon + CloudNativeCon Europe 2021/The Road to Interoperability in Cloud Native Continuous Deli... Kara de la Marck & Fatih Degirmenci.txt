The Road to Interoperability in Cloud Native Continuous Delivery - Kara de la Marck, CloudBees & Fatih Degirmenci, Ericsson

The emergence of cloud native has resulted in tremendous advances in enabling organizations to develop new services and make them available to end users. In addition, new paradigms such as Continuous Delivery (CD) allow organisations to do this much faster than before, empowering them to go to market ahead of the competition. Despite its many advantages, the cloud native CD ecosystem has its challenges. This session will discuss issues arising from the lack of interoperability across proliferating cloud native CD technologies. We will look at end user case studies, including existing integration initiatives such as that between Tekton and Jenkins X. However, these initiatives are localised to the projects involved and do not address the challenges holistically. We will highlight the necessity, and greater sustainability, of a holistic approach to interoperability in the CD ecosystem and invite attendees to join community efforts.
