The Road to Interoperability in Cloud Native Continuous Delivery - Kara de la Marck, CloudBees & Fatih Degirmenci, Ericsson

The emergence of cloud native has resulted in tremendous advances in enabling organizations to develop new services and make them available to end users. In addition, new paradigms such as Continuous Delivery (CD) allow organisations to do this much faster than before, empowering them to go to market ahead of the competition. Despite its many advantages, the cloud native CD ecosystem has its challenges. This session will discuss issues arising from the lack of interoperability across proliferating cloud native CD technologies. We will look at end user case studies, including existing integration initiatives such as that between Tekton and Jenkins X. However, these initiatives are localised to the projects involved and do not address the challenges holistically. We will highlight the necessity, and greater sustainability, of a holistic approach to interoperability in the CD ecosystem and invite attendees to join community efforts.

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,599
sig

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,440
thank you for joining our talk on the

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,200
road to interoperability in cloud native

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,360
continuous delivery

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,640
in the context of continuous delivery

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,480
what do we mean by interoperability

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,239
interoperability composability and

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,840
extensibility of all terms to describe

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,760
the openness of the system

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,920
that is its ability to offer components

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,000
that can be easily used by or integrated

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,079
into other systems

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,039
however integration and interoperability

00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
while often used

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,079
synonymously are not the same and have

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,320
significant

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
differences integration is generally

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,359
understood as combining applications to

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,040
function together

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
these applications don't necessarily

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,840
have common interfaces

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,360
and often use different data formats

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,880
the result is often when engineering

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,600
teams need to have these applications

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,960
work together they write glucose

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,640
and these custom solutions have

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,799
maintenance costs

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,680
in addition services can become tightly

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,439
coupled

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,880
and it can be a significant engineering

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,000
effort to later replace one of the

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,720
applications for something

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,799
else interoperability on the other hand

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,560
focuses on open interfaces

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
and standardized metadata that enable

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
controlled and defined access to

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,200
services or information from a

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,119
different application or system let's

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,399
consider interfaces as an example of an

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:44,799
abstraction which enables

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,640
interoperability

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,560
if the interface is well specified and

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,560
openly available multiple service

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,320
providers can implement the service

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,079
and enable customers to consume the

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
service in a known way

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,680
using the defined interface this

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,960
provides a number of practical

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,040
advantages

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,079
for example if client a consumes a

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,240
service by b

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,399
through a well-defined interface a could

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,119
switch to c's implementation of the same

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,679
service

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,840
which uses the same interface and a

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,920
should not experience any failures

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
how b or c implement the service is not

00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,640
relevant to a

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,440
which is only concerned with the

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,879
specifications of the interface

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
the ability to replace one

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,879
implementation of a service with another

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
that operates in the same way without

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,280
causing failures is

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,440
interoperability well-defined public

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
interfaces enable interoperability by

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,239
enabling both access

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,680
and multiple implementations

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,440
the result for end users of those

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
interfaces is that they have a choice

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,120
in which implementation to consume and

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,040
the ability to switch between

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,560
implementations without experiencing any

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,160
failures

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,680
in addition to open interfaces

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
standardized metadata is another

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,720
abstraction

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,160
that enables interoperability

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,640
standardized metadata

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,400
enables systems to incorporate content

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
from other disparate and independent

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,920
systems

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
in other words interoperability is

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
achieved through data formats and

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
communication protocols

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,120
which the systems can use to function

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,920
together in a standardized manner

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,720
without deep

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,120
customizations the definition of

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,800
interoperability in the cicd domain is

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,879
not different from how it's defined in

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,400
other domains it is about data and the

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,239
exchange event

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,920
as you can see on the slide everything

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,519
under integration is basically work that

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,920
the end user has to do

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
and everything under operability is the

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,840
result of work that has already been

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,519
done

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
when building the services that users

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,080
consume so the result is less work for

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
end users

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
okay when we look at the continuous

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
delivery landscape and this landscape

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,480
has been developed by the continuous

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,159
delivery foundation

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
we can see that the continuous delivery

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,239
ecosystem is flourishing

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,080
there's a rapidly growing set of cicd

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,360
tools available for end users and this

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,879
is fantastic

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,799
the new tools and technologies being

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,879
developed bring fresh approaches to

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,000
problems or issues within the cicd

00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,599
domain

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,599
however the explosion in the number of

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,799
tools is not without its challenges

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,920
interoperability among them so let's

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,080
look more closely

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
at interoperability within the cicd

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,280
context

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,760
first pipeline standardization and or

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,360
standardization in pipeline languages

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,359
the goal here is to have the ability to

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,919
migrate or run pipelines created on one

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,519
tool

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,040
on another one as is next the ability to

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,919
connect pipelines running on different

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,759
tools in a standardized way

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,680
and pipeline data for traceability or

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,840
visualization

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,000
the goal is to propagate data from cicd

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,040
tools in a way that external tools

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,560
can consume regardless of what cicd tool

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,320
created that data

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,080
we will look at two open source projects

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,479
that help you gain more visibility

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,000
into your ci cd system and consider the

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,680
work that they are doing

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,040
to map the different data formats of

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,919
different tools and how greater

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,400
interoperability could help

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,320
for ci cd events we defined an event

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,840
following the cloud events definition

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,800
has a data record expressing an

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,240
occurrence and its context

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,320
the goal is the standardization of

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,280
events so that ci cd tools that adhere

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,240
to the standard

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,600
can interoperate with each other the

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
common theme across the different

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,440
perspectives is data

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,360
and exchanging data across various tools

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,919
that may be employed by an organization

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,600
as part of their cicd pipelines

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
the data could either be in the form of

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
pipeline definitions

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,120
consumed by pipelines as input or

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,639
produced by pipelines as output

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,120
this means that the definition of

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,039
interoperability in the cicd

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,320
domain is similar to how it is defined

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,440
in other domains it's

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,199
all about the data and exchanging data

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,960
among the activities of the inter

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,120
interoperability sig

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,360
we look at existing case studies such as

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,320
how jenkins x incorporates tecton as its

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
pipeline engine

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,360
to help users build and deliver software

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,199
using the cloud well

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
xingx helps you manage the lifecycle of

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,680
your application including continuous

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,639
delivery

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,039
on kubernetes chingasex uses tekton for

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,759
standardized declarative pipeline apis

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,840
and build execution when users install

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
jenkins extecton is also installed into

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
the kubernetes cluster

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
when users create new applications or

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,479
import existing ones

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,319
shinkansen will automatically add

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,840
pipeline as code

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,160
tucked on resources to the git

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,919
repository alongside the source code

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,520
and configure web book handling for git

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,280
events

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,800
the techcloud pipeline resources that

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,080
are added come from a base set of

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,759
reusable pipelines

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,080
that live in the jingenzex pipeline

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,039
catalog the jing insects project

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,960
essentially

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,240
aligns its pipeline definitions with

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,720
tecton and make it

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,160
makes it super easy for any test from

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,919
the textile catalog

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,240
and to be used inside a chaincontext

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,919
created pipeline

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
that level of interoperability between

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,120
ci cd tools is relatively rare and

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,680
remains specific to individual projects

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,280
so now let's look a bit deeper into some

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,639
of the benefits of interoperability

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,199
especially as regards

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,039
the maintenance of your ci cd system and

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,960
then we'll look at some tools

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,840
that uh some episodes that have been

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,039
created that help you in this

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,479
so additional benefits of

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,319
interoperability greater

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,880
interoperability between components

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
provides

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,160
many benefits including improved

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,280
scalability reliability and maintenance

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
there's much to be said about these

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,639
benefits in fact you will touch on how

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,039
interoperability

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,840
improves scalability and reliability so

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,199
i'm going to look at how

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
interoperability can help

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,800
improve the maintainability of your

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,800
system

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,840
and as we know the effort or cost of

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,960
software is actually not in the initial

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,479
deployment and its development but in

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
its maintenance

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,599
one of the most important ways in which

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,639
interoperability helps us with the

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
maintenance of systems

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,360
is in managing complexity in complex

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,199
software for example with systems with

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,199
many components and much of blue code

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,919
to integrate them there's a greater risk

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,319
of introducing bugs when making changes

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,919
and reasons for that include that the

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,520
system is harder for developers to

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,599
understand and reason about

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,599
that there are some hidden assumptions

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,280
and that the unexpected interactions and

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,000
unintended consequences of making

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,360
changes

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,199
are worked so reducing complexly

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,360
greatly improves the maintainability of

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:10,800
software thus simplicity is a key

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,240
goal for any system and making a system

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,039
simpler does not necessarily

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,360
mean reducing its functionality it can

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,560
mean

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,199
removing the complexity that is

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,919
created when you are implementing the

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,440
solution

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,120
that you are trying to solve by reducing

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,120
the need for application blue code

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,240
interoperability helps make your system

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,919
simpler

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,599
it also reduces type coupling in the

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,880
system again makes

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
making your system much more

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,640
maintainable it is likely that the ci cd

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,240
systems requirements will change

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,760
there could be legal or regulatory

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,080
requirements that change

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,000
versus the growth of your system or for

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
some changes and new tools will emerge

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,360
that you'd like to incorporate

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,959
the ease with that you can modify a

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,720
system and adapt it to changing

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,519
requirements is closely linked to its

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,519
simplicity

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,080
and its abstractions such as

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,160
standardized data formats

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
good abstractions help reduce complexity

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,839
and make the system

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,240
easier to modify and adapt for new use

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,920
cases

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
increased interoperability can also help

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,560
us with the operability of the system

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
so good operability with standardized

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,600
data models

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,680
can help make routine tasks easy by

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,120
exhibiting predictable behavior and thus

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,360
minimizing surprises

00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,959
providing good support for automation

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,959
and providing visibility into the

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,680
runtime behavior and internals of your

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,000
system

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,240
with good monitoring this increase

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,320
visibility into your system can help

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,120
with investigating failures and finding

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,120
and fixing bugs

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,279
good operability means having good

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,000
visibility into your system's health

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,120
and having effective ways of managing it

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,560
we're going to look at two really

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,080
interesting open source projects that

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,279
can help you gain more visibility

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,959
into your cicv system the tools use

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,800
variations of data mapping between

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,519
different data structures

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,120
to be able to achieve that visibility

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,800
and so we will consider how greater

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,959
interoperability could help reduce that

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,399
mapping work and facilitate expansion

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,399
of the capabilities of these tools

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,880
so four keys is an exam center project

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,880
showing insights that can be garnered by

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,760
ci cd event data

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,920
the devops and assessment torah team has

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,360
identified four key metrics that measure

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,519
team's software delivery performance

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,519
their deployment frequency that is how

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,079
often an organization successfully

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
releases your production lead time for

00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
changes

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,240
and that is the amount of time it takes

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
to get a commit

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,240
into production and time to restore

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,519
service

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,120
just how long it takes for an

00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,800
organization to recover from a failure

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,560
in production

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,160
and change failure rate just the

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,079
percentage of deployments that cause a

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,399
failure in production

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,640
using data on github events in ci cd

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,920
pipelines and making inferences about

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,720
links between incidents

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
and the events involved the force keys

00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,920
project

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,839
generates the four keys to our metrics

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,959
one of the challenges of gathering these

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,320
dual metrics

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,000
is that the deployment change and

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
incident data are usually in disparate

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,760
systems

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,360
so for the four keys solution was to

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,200
create a generalized pipeline

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,519
that can be extended to process inputs

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,839
from a wide variety of sources

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,800
before keys project in effect creates a

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,120
mapping between

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,560
events in different pipelines and tools

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,959
in order to be able to generalize the

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,200
data it receives

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,959
standardized modes data for ci cd events

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
help with the mapping work that the

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,920
four keys project has to do between the

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
different data structures of the

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,240
different tools

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,920
creating standardized metadata for cicd

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,600
events is one of the main workstations

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,120
of the interoperability sig

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,160
and is considered critical for the

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,160
interoperability in the cicd domain

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,920
so in addition standardized metadata

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,360
will help improve the maintainability of

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,120
your cicd system

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,200
by facilitating connections between

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,040
pipelines and other systems

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,839
and will reduce the need to write

00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,079
adapters or group guide

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
standardized metadata of events in ci cd

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,079
pipelines

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,680
would enable much greater

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,639
interoperability between tools and

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,839
platforms

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,079
and more consistent data to be used for

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,560
analysis

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
so now we'll look at jing it's like cd

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,360
indicators

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,920
so this add-on to the django text ci cd

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,240
platform

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,760
helps you gain visibility into your ci

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,120
cd system

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,680
these insights are based on the

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,760
durametrics and the space framework

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,480
the metrics are generated using git

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,720
events as with the four keys project

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,639
in addition jenkins x has a kubernetes

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,959
custom resource definition

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,959
forging insect specific type called the

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,480
pipeline activity

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,240
a kubernetes controller watches the

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
kubernetes api server

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,680
for these custom pipeline activity

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,079
events

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
the two main types of event data so get

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:51,519
events and cluster events

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,120
are kind of mapped together and combined

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,800
to create the metrics displayed in the

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
graffama dashboards

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,639
which is an example on the slide but

00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,360
this mapping for now happens within the

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,399
context of

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,560
one cicd project jenkins x and not

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,200
across multiple projects or tools

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,880
here's a different mapping to that done

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,839
by the four keys project using different

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,680
data inputs

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,600
but note that this mapping work between

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,560
differing data formats needs to be done

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,079
by both of these projects

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,560
so the tools and technologies that are

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,839
used to construct ci cd pipelines and

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,040
the pipelines themselves

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,639
produce a lot of data organizations will

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
collect store and use this data in

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,800
various ways to get value

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,800
out of it within the interoperability

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,399
side we are focusing on ways to reduce

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,639
the need for data mapping between

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,000
projects tools and other data sources

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,000
by increasing interoperability through

00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,240
abstractions i mostly discuss

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,600
standardized metadata for ci cd events

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
as one of the ways to increase

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
interoperability

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,320
currently the cicd tools and

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,639
technologies

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,720
have no standardized way to produce and

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,560
consume that metadata

00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,160
that is why standardized metadata for ci

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,760
cd events is one of our main areas of

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,519
focus within the interoperability sig

00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
in addition how such metadata could be

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
consumed and produced is another topic

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
this is being looked at within the

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,320
continuous delivery foundation's event

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,320
sec

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,519
fatima's nut will not speak more about

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,120
the work we are doing within the

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,440
interoperability sig

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,399
and within the wider continuous delivery

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,399
foundation community

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,079
thank you tara i would like to start

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,680
talking about continues there foundation

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:30,240
which is a sister comment to cloud

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,079
native concreting foundation

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,360
as we all know there are many great

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,760
technologies out there

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,440
one can use to help construct pipelines

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,920
and establish cloud-native countries to

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,399
derive in their organizations

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,519
however there is not without challenges

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,440
and one of the challenges

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,639
is the fragmentation within the cicd

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,760
domain

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,440
it is challenging to adopt use integrate

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,120
and contribute to various crc

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
technologies

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,480
here continuous data foundation comes to

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
the rescue

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,160
continues foundation was founded during

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
march 2019

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,839
hosted by new york's foundation

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,199
providing neutral home to cultivate for

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,480
the next generation of continuous

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,079
federation

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,760
there are various ways continues their

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,079
foundation enables this

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,160
first and foremost it provides home to

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,279
various open source ci cd projects

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,480
such as jenkins jenkins x

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:23,360
chemical pecton driver cd

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
and orterius in addition to hosting

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,920
projects

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,440
it also welcomes the creation of special

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,040
interest groups and working groups for

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,720
community members to come and tolerate

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,560
on various topics within cloud native

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,160
contents delivery

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
there are currently five special test

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,519
groups security

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,839
amidops interactivity best practices

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,480
and events each looking into different

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,560
areas within continuously

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,320
as you can guess these groups have

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,560
community members to find like-minded

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,959
people to tolerate on a certain topic

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,399
hr to the projects and find ways to

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,240
contribute to projects

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,639
and broader contains their ecosystem

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,639
further

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,720
when it comes to topics that are

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,880
critical for interval within

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,720
cloud-native continuous delivery

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,040
i would like to feel of the key topics

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,360
the and have been working on

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,920
so you can see how it impacts our way to

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,440
become better doing contextually

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,320
four topics i would like to highlight

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,560
during this talk are shared vocabulary

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,199
standardized metadata events and policy

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,959
as you notice these topics are pretty

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,519
disconnected from each other

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,519
it was similar for us as well however

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,800
when we started diving into the topic of

00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,279
interoperability

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,000
and get into the details we began

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
realizing that

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,399
the problem is much bigger than just how

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,079
to get cic technologies

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,600
interoperate with each other with

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,639
well-defined interfaces

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,000
or by standardized approach it is also

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
very challenging to tackle these

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,759
problems alone in our community

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
but there are already many things worked

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
on by our sister communities

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,279
that could help addressing them either

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,240
by learning how they solve similar

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,000
challenges

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:04,240
or directly using some of the things

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,959
they do rather than us limiting things

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,120
let us start with shared vocabulary

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,000
special interest group interval ability

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,600
was approved during january 2020 by

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,240
continuous data foundation

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,559
taking oversight community so we are a

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,480
little bit older than one year

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,839
we were very eager to get hands-on with

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,799
the technologies we are using

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,959
and working with however we started

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:29,919
noticing that even though everyone knows

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,160
what continuous integration compensatory

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,080
and continuous deployment are the terms

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,760
we use to communicate with each other as

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,240
humans differ

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,160
apart from that counts used by different

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,799
cic technologies to describe the same

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,880
thing differ

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,720
as well contributing to the challenges

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,360
with human communication

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,960
for example we identified three

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
different terms are used by various

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,679
technologies when they talk about

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,919
pipelines

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,400
workflow activity well hyphen

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,000
as you can guess these impacts are able

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,640
to communicate with each other

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,559
since if i am using a certain technology

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,280
i naturally use the timelapse of the

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,720
tool

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,320
during my today day communication and i

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,960
may have difficulty to do

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,799
someone using a different technology

00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,280
since that person is probably using a

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:19,360
terminology of tech which they are using

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,559
we then need to spend few minutes to map

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,799
terms with each other

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,039
or translate them so we can talk to each

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,039
other

00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,280
this made us realize that even before we

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,280
start talking about technology issues

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,039
we need to put effort to improve how we

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,880
communicate with each other

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,799
we spend three weeks to discuss and

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
collect the terms used by different cic

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,559
technologies on a document

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,320
appointment members from those projects

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,000
describe the terms we collect from their

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,760
project's point of view

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,360
and we finally create the table that

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,679
maps different terms across different

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,000
technologies with each other

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,000
this helped us a lot since we can now

00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,799
have an easy way to look at the terms we

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,559
don't know

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,919
and see what they mean for us using

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,919
different terms

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,200
we call this document project a stone

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,679
for cicd

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,880
and currently has terms for 14 cicd

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,280
projects

00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,640
in addition to cit technologies we

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,240
include current source software

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,679
configuration management tools

00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,600
such as credit github and gitlab

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,679
this is a community maintained document

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,440
and we welcome contributions so please

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,080
check it out

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,840
are we done with this definitely not

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,280
since this topic is relevant to modern

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,200
interoperability area

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,520
this topic is continued to work by

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,000
special interest group best practices

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,360
so they look at what certain term was

00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,200
first time described

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,200
suggest complete integration

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,480
continuously continues

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:44,799
devops will define the term first time

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,799
and what it went through over the years

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,200
the next topic i want to discuss is

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,960
standard lighting

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,080
data the cic tools and technologies that

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,880
are used to contract

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,720
cicd pipelines and pipeline stem cells

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,840
produce lots of data

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,919
we as users collect store use

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,760
and analyze this data in various ways to

00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,280
get value out of it

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:09,600
there are two questions we are looking

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,320
answers from the later

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,000
first one is about what are the types of

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,039
metadata we use

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,159
the second one is about how we produce

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,360
consume and use them one of the

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,520
contributing factors

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,280
is lack of standardized way for cita

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,880
tools and technologies it refers to what

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,320
when the data is to produce

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,159
and concern how to do that it is true

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,000
that there are initiatives across

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,880
various open source projects to align

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,760
the way this is done such as importo

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,120
veritas

00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,880
jenkins x and however

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,720
this topic requires a holistic and

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,799
collaborative approach to identify the

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
needs and challenges first

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,880
followed by analyzing existing careful

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,440
stakeholders explore possibilities

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,000
just in mind how this is done either

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,559
based on

00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,919
extinct efforts or by combining them to

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,400
come up with the standard way

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,600
conservatively

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,280
when it comes to what we are doing

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,000
within contextual foundation and

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,679
sufficient test group interpretability

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,760
we are currently documenting the types

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,720
of metadata we produce and consume

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,000
starting with commit and artifact data

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,240
in addition to this

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,440
as i noted earlier we are not after

00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,360
creating our own team

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,960
so we are also talking with various

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
communities to learn more about what

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,400
they are doing

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,559
see the overlaps gaps and explore

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,480
collaboration opportunities

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,400
we recently start collaboration with

00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,080
spdx community since

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,960
we know that they also work on some of

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,679
these topics within the data

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,280
i realized i didn't talk about our

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,080
question for the metadata

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,280
how the metadata is produced and how it

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
is concerned

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,120
and this is on purpose since one of the

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,679
continental foundations special interest

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,440
groups

00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,520
especially in periscope events is

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:54,640
looking after this explore the use of

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,640
events in cicd

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,960
as we have been discussing since the

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,400
beginning of our talk

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,640
space continuous integration and

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,880
continuous dairy systems will not talk

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
to each other in a standardized way

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
this leads to problems related to

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,520
interoperability multiplication of

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,159
failure issues

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,960
and poor automation to address these

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,880
issues

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,400
the topic of events were brought up by

00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,919
community members especially interests

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,240
of interoperability

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,320
see if there are others who want to take

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,039
a closer look at using events within ci

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,280
cd

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,360
given that guns are everywhere offering

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,400
solutions to various issues such as

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,760
scalability resiliency coupling

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,320
traceability and so on the discussion

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,919
resulted

00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,919
in the formation of a work stream within

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,360
special interest group interval ability

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,400
we aim to look at events more closely

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,919
in february 2021 this workshop

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,600
stream has become a top level

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,480
specialized group within continuity

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,720
foundation

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,880
to take the idea to the next level and

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,840
look at standardizing around

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,559
around advanced within cicd this special

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,880
trace group

00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,480
is looking at how events can help create

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,039
ci cd systems

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,320
with a decoupled architecture that is

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,280
easy to scale

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,000
and makes it resilient to failures using

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,000
events

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,360
could also increase automation when

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,679
connecting workflows

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,559
from different systems to each other as

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,600
a result

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,919
empowering tracing visualizing

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,360
auditing of the connected workflow to

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,200
these events

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,120
point members from various open source

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,159
projects take part in special interest

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,960
group events

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,480
bringing their perspectives out and

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,240
ideas to the groups

00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,080
some of these communities are from

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,520
within continuous foundation

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,080
such as spinker jenkins

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,279
hoteliers we also have participation

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
from other projects

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,880
such as captain from cloud native

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,440
computing foundation

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
iphone the group aims to provide

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
reference implementations

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,400
such as event listeners and event

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,400
standards on top of cloud events

00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,200
the last key topic i would like to

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,440
highlight is policy

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,279
or to be more precise positively on

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,600
continuous delivery

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,279
this topic looks at how organizations

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
could define standard policies for

00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,080
cloud-native continuity pipelines

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,000
the topic was brought into specialties

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,720
group interpreted recently

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,240
and it gives us a different perspective

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,279
as come to what issues like

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,080
interoperability

00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,320
within cic domain clauses we know that

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,159
most of the cic technologies provide

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,520
ways to enforce security policies within

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,000
the organization

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,400
we also noticed a transit in crc domain

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,120
by the open policy agent for this

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,080
so things look really encouraging

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
however

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,720
when we start going into the details and

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,960
looked at various different use cases

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,000
we started realizing that there are

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
things to work

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,240
on further to enable organizations to

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,440
fund define standard policies

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,840
seamlessly one of the things we noticed

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
that

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,640
the use of policy aided by cic

00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,480
technologies does not necessarily mean

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,200
things will just work across different

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,880
cic technologies since

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,960
there are slight differences when it

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,360
comes to how these technologies being

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,640
open

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,880
for this agent in addition to this

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,840
there are other things taking time into

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
consideration

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,080
such as existence of external systems

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,640
and their role in enforcing policies

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,640
as we try to illustrate in the diagram

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,080
if an organization uses two different

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,559
cica technologies

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,799
as well as external systems as part of

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,919
their faulty enforcement mechanism

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,720
things get practically tricky apart from

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,919
that

00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,640
there are other policies and security

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,760
policies

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,039
such as business policies these

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,279
publicly also need to be looked further

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,720
as watched earlier this discussion

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,480
started within special interest of

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,919
intervality recently

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,440
and we will reach out to various

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,520
projects that are actively working

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,360
policy working on policy topic

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,159
before this agent not a network

00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,919
automation platform voice framework

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,440
please join us if you have interest to

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,000
participate in discussions and

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:07,120
contributions

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,440
so these are the four

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,559
topics i've selected from the work we

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,799
have been doing filling

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,600
continue foundation there are obviously

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,720
more topics

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,360
we are working on so please join us

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,279
and help us with these topics based on

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,840
your experience and ideas and

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:29,120
organizational needs

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,520
until now we talked about projects

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,120
and communities but what about home

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,360
users

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,039
so i've touched the end user aspects of

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,120
content instigation continuously

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:41,360
as well i am from an end user

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,279
organization and it is important for my

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,320
organization to keep itself connected to

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,919
the ecosystem

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
and contribute to the projects we are

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,039
using this can't happen without active

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,799
involvement

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:52,159
and collaboration within open source

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,120
where we can take part in the

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,360
discussions

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,120
with communities which will impact how

00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,799
our organizations utilizing these

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,640
technologies as part of their continuous

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,159
level journey

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,080
apart from joining and collaborating

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,120
within the communities it is also

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,760
important to highlight

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,880
our needs use cases and challenges to

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:12,559
the projects from end users perspectives

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,640
confidence data foundation and user

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,559
concept provides such an opportunity

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,720
and allows end-user organizations to

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,640
take part in the discussions

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,159
and user concert recently published it

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,919
is 2021

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,240
planned based on the input from end

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,320
users the topic the group planned to

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,200
work on during 2021

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,960
are measuring develop success developer

00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,120
productivity and experience

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,200
colombian technology choices on

00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:39,520
governance and compliance

00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,360
as you can notice all these topics have

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,000
relations to interoperability

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:45,520
in one way or the other for example

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,440
measuring devops success require

00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,360
organizations to collect key metrics to

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,880
evaluate delivery performance

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,640
it is very difficult to achieve that

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,360
since the tools that

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,320
is used by organizations whether scm or

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:58,320
ci cd

00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,080
they all expose these metrics in

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,399
different ways

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,120
if you are from an end user organization

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,159
please

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,279
join us help us with our journey within

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,279
continuity foundation

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,159
finally few words about future which is

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,039
what i try to summarize during

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,240
discussions about

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,320
key topics we work with various topics

00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,399
within various special terrorist groups

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,320
as you can see here the three countries

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,200
the referendum foundation sufficient

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,120
groups looks at various topics as and

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,799
will continue to study them

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,279
we would like to contribute cloud native

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:39,120
contents theory domain in various ways

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,039
white papers case studies best practices

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,159
specifications and recurrence

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,799
representations

00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,880
and so on in addition to working with

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,720
these topics within our community

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,919
we will either continue collaborating

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,520
with other communities

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,320
such as cncf spdx and financial

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,640
networking

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,760
and so on or look for new collaboration

00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,679
opportunities

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,880
it is critical that we as sister

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,960
communities work on this

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,440
like a single community to tackle these

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,840
challenges and collaboratively

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,399
thank you most of the work in the cicd

00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,600
domain is driven by communities

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,960
and so we invite you and your

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,880
communities to join us in the

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
interoperability sig

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,640
the ideas incubated and specifications

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,399
developed by communities

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:25,760
tend to become candidates for de facto

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,760
standards for example with cloud events

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,880
we believe that cross collaboration and

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:31,039
pollination across

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,960
communities and industries is key to

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,559
addressing challenges

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,080
because these bring diverse perspectives

00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:38,240
that enable us to develop better

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,760
solutions together

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,679
please you join us in the continuous

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,640
delivery foundation's interoperability's

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,240
sake

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,159
there are links in the slides on how to

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,799
find out more about the interoperability

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,440
sig

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:51,120
and the continuous delivery foundation

00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,039
we thank you for listening to our talk

00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,120
