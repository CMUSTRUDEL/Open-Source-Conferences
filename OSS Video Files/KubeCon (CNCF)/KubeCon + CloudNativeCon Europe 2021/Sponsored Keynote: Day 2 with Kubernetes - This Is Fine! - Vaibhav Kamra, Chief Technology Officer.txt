00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
hello everyone

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,640
it's great to be here at kubecon eu my

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,840
name

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
is web of camara and i'm the cto here at

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,400
cast and by veeam

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,960
at castin we focus on data protection

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,320
so backup and recovery for kubernetes

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
applications

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,760
uh this is my sixth year here at kubecon

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,920
it's really an amazing event i love

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,320
coming here because it's a great way to

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,399
learn

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,320
what the community has been doing as

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,160
well as share experiences

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
with with everybody out there in the

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,520
same journey

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,520
so in that spirit what i'd like to do

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,239
today is talk a little bit

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,160
about our experiences with our

00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,920
kubernetes platform development

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,920
as well as what we've observed working

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,680
with a large number of customers

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,680
as they've scaled out the number of

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,680
users the number of clusters

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,200
the number of applications they have and

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,040
really the challenges they ran

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,600
into this is very much a here and now

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,439
problem if we look at the most recent

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,240
cncf survey

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,280
80 of us who took the survey indicated

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,080
that we are

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
uh running kubernetes in production and

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,680
what we're also seeing

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
is that the journey from pilot to

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,439
production

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,200
it's going much faster just because of

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
the maturity of the tooling that's out

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,360
there

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,720
as well as all the learnings and

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,439
education that's available to us

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,520
now security and business continuity are

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,200
two key challenges that i wanted to

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,920
focus on how do we keep

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,920
make sure our environments are secure

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,320
both from internal and external threats

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,200
from

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,720
breaches if vulnerabilities show up how

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,479
are we going to address them

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,079
soon and fast how are we going to detect

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,119
those things how are we going to deal

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,040
with ransomware

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,280
so these are some of the key what we

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,680
call day two challenges things that show

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,920
up

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,560
after you've gone through the initial

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,720
stage of of platform development

00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,959
a lot of issues that we observe actually

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,599
come down to misconfigured access

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,360
that is our users or tenants have too

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,680
much access to the platform

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,760
there is this desire to enable

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
self-service in these environments

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,680
to allow our users to be able to do what

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,760
they need to do without having to

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
involve operations or file a ticket for

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,640
everything

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,560
but what that can lead to is

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,599
misconfigured policies

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,840
privilege escalation is also very common

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,280
it's not just direct access to api

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,000
resources that you have to worry about

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,879
sometimes

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,599
but what access to other operators do

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,840
users have

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
in this environment do these operators

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,879
that often

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,160
have privileged access to the cluster do

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,319
they expose apis

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,599
that allow you to control who can access

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,879
it or who cannot

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,800
because if not then users this can be

00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,599
privileged escalation just because a

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,920
user

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,519
has access to one of the operator apis

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,680
that lets them do something that

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,760
they shouldn't be allowed to do the

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,000
other issue that we see

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,120
is the ability to react to

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,959
vulnerabilities

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
so if there was a vulnerability

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
discovered if there's a zero day exploit

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,159
that needs to be a patch needs to be

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,720
rolled out for

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,480
can we do this fast enough without

00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,120
business with with minimum business

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,799
impact

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
because not being able to do that just

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,879
leaves us vulnerable as well

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,040
and then lastly the third one i wanted

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,040
to talk about is ransomware

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,319
it's a big topic right now it has a

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,879
large financial

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,440
and business impact so do we have

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:43,040
processes in place to detect ransomware

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,280
as well as the ability to recover

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,560
if ransomware hits and for example

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,000
encrypts all our data we

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,000
we want to be in the position that

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,439
you're not held ransom

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,680
to to such an exploit so what are the

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,080
recommendations and learnings over here

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,720
so

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,200
well first plan early on we often talk

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
about

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,560
shift left in these environments and

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,640
what that means is planning and

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
implementing processes

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,159
that are required for production as

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,480
early as possible

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,400
in the life cycle of the platform in dev

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,840
and test environments you really want

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,120
that to happen

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,680
early the second one is is automation

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,359
automation is key for everything we do

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,160
in in the cloud native world

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,919
and it's no different over here so

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,520
having automation for example that

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,560
builds over tooling like

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,639
oppa which is open policy agent for

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,560
our back rule creation or by policy

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,000
creation that's something that we've

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,160
seen our customers do

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,479
and and really helps with that

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,639
misconfigured access

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,120
issue that i had talked about having

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:48,000
automation to roll out new clusters to

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,840
migrate applications over from your old

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,280
clusters that need to be patched over to

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,360
these new environments

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,479
that's also key you do not want to be in

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,080
the situation

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,520
or we don't want to be in the situation

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,639
where we're we're stuck with

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,320
environments that

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,240
are vulnerable that need to be patched

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,080
and we can't do that because

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,479
there's a large business impact so

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,720
that's another recommendation over here

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
and then lastly around business continue

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,199
to have a plan in place

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,080
um not just to deal with things like

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,800
user error

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,919
or or disaster but to deal with things

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,120
like ransomware

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,039
having immutable encrypted backups

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,240
version backups available

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,280
so that you can deal with such issues is

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,680
key over here

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,639
the basic principles here are not very

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,639
different from

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,639
our operational experiences in other

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,160
environments it comes down to

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,680
planning detection mitigation planning

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,000
for this early on

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,919
and automating um all of the things that

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,840
we we just talked about

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,980
thank you everyone for listening i i

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,840
hope you have a great coupon so thank

00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,210
[Applause]

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,120
you
