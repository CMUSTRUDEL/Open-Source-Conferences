00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,799
hi everybody

00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,880
welcome to shaping kubernetes community

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:16,880
culture my name is ava black and i am an

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,960
open source program manager in azure

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,760
i'm also part of the kubernetes code of

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,760
conduct committee

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,960
hi my name is bob killen i am a program

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,199
manager

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,800
at google and i'm a member of the

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,000
community steering committee as well as

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,920
a co-chair of sick contributor

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,160
experience while we were planning this

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,640
keynote i've also been playing valheim

00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,320
it's a little uh sandbox survival game

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,160
that came out a few months ago

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,680
along my adventures i found some

00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,120
abandoned buildings

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,559
in this really awesome spot on the map

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,360
and i told my friends and they rushed

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,000
over

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,399
started chopping wood and carrying ore

00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,640
and

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,199
pretty soon we transformed it into this

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,199
thriving little village

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,480
so whether you are adventuring in the

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,719
viking afterlife

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,079
or working in open source communities

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,239
where it's at

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,680
and the kubernetes community has grown

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,240
from a little village

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
back at the very first cncf summit next

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,520
to oscon in 2015

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
writer sat in the back of the room and

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,759
watched to this

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,600
incredible global community we have

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,479
today

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,400
and so by about 2017 that community had

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,080
grown to 4 000 people

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,880
and the bootstrap steering committee

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,560
decided to write down their values

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,439
to write down what they believed the

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,040
whole community's core values to be

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,880
and that's about the time that the the

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,600
second generation of leaders were coming

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,600
up in the ranks

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
and now today in 2021 our community is

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,799
so much larger

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,479
just looking at slack it's over 120 000

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,880
people

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,240
and so it is even more important as we

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,720
continue to to grow

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,000
to pass on our values and to not just be

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,479
willing to learn from each

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,680
other but to really want to and to want

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,680
to see new perspectives

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,840
so it's not just the total size of our

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,000
contributor community

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
but also the number of leads our sub

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,560
project owners our org members and more

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
our organizational structure had to

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,560
evolve in 2017 to handle

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
and support like a few thousand now

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,200
today we're close to just 20 000 unique

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,000
contributors

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
in the past year that's larger than many

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
cities

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
and that's way larger than my little

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,599
village in valheim

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,440
and our early leaders described our core

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,160
values in ways that reflected

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,040
who we are as a community and who we as

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,400
individuals

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,319
strive to be

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
and while each new leader brings

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,760
something new to the table

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,200
it is crucial that we don't lose sight

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
of our core values

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,480
and the values that shaped who this

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,280
community that this community that we

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,599
love

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,239
and that has been core to the success of

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,080
the technical project itself

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
so what does it mean to embody those

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,239
values

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,920
how do we pass them on what can we learn

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
from other open source communities

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,200
or from our own history from world

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,560
events

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
these are some of the questions that

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,920
have been on our mind as the third

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,959
generation of community leads

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,879
as a community we're at a crossroads the

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,360
growth that we've experienced comes with

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,159
a

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
number of scaling challenges but how do

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,480
we continue to grow

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,879
how do we continue to support our

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,720
contributors our users and everyone that

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,560
makes up our community

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,159
how do we make sure our values continue

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,480
to be represented in our actions

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,159
then today when this becomes even more

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,200
difficult when you add in the stressors

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,440
from the pandemic

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,680
the isolation the flagrant social

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,120
injustice coming to a head

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,200
all of these things have been forced

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
multipliers to the difficulty

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
in maintaining our connections with each

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,640
other

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,200
much like kubernetes technology social

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,720
groups

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,720
have scalability limits too

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,439
in the 1990s there was this

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
anthropologist robin dunbar

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,080
you might have heard of dunbar's number

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,720
he theorized that social group size

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,319
is related to mammalian brain structure

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
and while he's often quoted with just a

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,680
single number

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,280
he actually postulated several different

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,400
numbers that relate to

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,680
different tiers of implicit trust and in

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,280
the outer group

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,880
about a thousand or two thousand are

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,040
people that you'd have to re-establish

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,560
context to if you met them again

00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
uh you know like an old high school

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,120
friend or something

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,800
and within the 150 to 250 which is the

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,479
the most quoted number

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,919
uh these are people that you might

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,120
remember their name you kind of know

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,639
what they're working on

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,360
maybe a little bit about their life and

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,400
you generally trust each other

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,000
within the next tier 20 to 30

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,759
are the the people that you work with on

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,040
a regular basis

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,639
you know what they're doing you have

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
trust in them that you share the same

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,040
goals

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,560
and then that smallest group about five

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,880
these are people you know so well you

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,720
can anticipate their actions

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,639
and you can find this pattern repeated

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,199
across human societies

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,199
and open source communities you can see

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,560
it in the optimum size of a dev team and

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,400
the two pizza rule

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,720
the maximum number of reports any

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,080
manager should have

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,880
and this model can be used to inform how

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,800
we understand the stressors on

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,800
and the structure of any intentionally

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,720
crafted social system

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
you might notice these circles roughly

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
match the sizes

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,320
of the kubernetes steering committee our

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,520
tech leads and our sig leads

00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,280
so let's take a step back and look at

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,240
some metrics

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,600
there's certainly you can a lot you can

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,639
take a look at to try and

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,560
tease out general contributor health so

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,759
why are we looking at pr reviews

00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,280
specifically well it's honestly one of

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,320
the best indicators we found

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,639
for our core contributor health most

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,000
reviews are completed by our org members

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
and specifically those that have

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,120
graduated to become reviewers or

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,800
approvers

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
they are active and they have

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
consistently demonstrated

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,600
many of the qualities that are laid out

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
in our values

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,199
another thing is for this we are looking

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,240
at the 119 release cycle for a reason

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,319
it kicked off right when we started

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,319
first hearing the rumblings of covet

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,400
many people were challenged with

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,120
suddenly you know

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
moving remote and having to find ways to

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,039
support themselves

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,639
and their family members it was obvious

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,400
our contributors were impacted

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,560
people were tired people are honestly

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,759
still tired

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,080
but in response the 119 release team

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,600
made the call to extend the release to

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,880
allow people more time

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
to get the work done but then later in

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,039
the

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,720
middle of the release cycle the racial

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
injustice in the united states and

00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,639
elsewhere

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,639
came to the forefront

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,599
in the civil rights protests in the u.s

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
calling for the recognition

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,800
of the injustices and the disadvantages

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,280
faced by

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,520
black and african americans quite

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,599
literally poured into the streets

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,840
and were consistently met with violent

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
response from government

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,039
and while individual members of our

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,360
community

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,880
express their support the community

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
leaders also felt it

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,919
it was crucial to express our collective

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,120
support

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,800
publicly as they say an injustice

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,560
ignored is an injustice condoned

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,360
so to demonstrate our values in one of

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,960
the few ways that an organization can do

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,000
steering and code of conduct read to

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
post the banner

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,720
and in response we received hateful and

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
trolling messages from a small number of

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,319
our community members

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,599
and i'm very disappointed by this it's

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,120
not acceptable

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,759
we expect better than that of each other

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,680
and i know how deeply this community

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,520
values being a welcoming

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,120
and safe place for everyone to bring

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,280
their authentic selves

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,599
and i admire how much we support each

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,639
other regardless of race or gender

00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:06,639
or sexuality or age religion or country

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,919
of origin

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,479
now these events from the protests to

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,080
covet

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,800
to the responses we received to the

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,120
banner created several opportunities for

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,000
us

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,919
as leaders many of whom are not black to

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,599
learn

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,520
there are two additional values that

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,280
were not stated four years ago

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,520
by which we believe our core

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,960
particularly to community leadership

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,800
and that is transparency and

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,320
accountability

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
and we will be introducing some new

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,959
measures to increase transparency into

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,880
our processes

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,399
over the coming release cycle so

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,159
this is a community of pure

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:44,000
accountability

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,600
we would allow our vision to the project

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
be damaged if we did

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,880
not uphold our we did nothing to uphold

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,720
our values

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,839
if we did not welcome every qualified

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,680
voice into technical

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:56,160
discussions now if you'd like to learn

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,839
more

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,240
about uh why we value diversity empathy

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,519
and humility so highly why we felt the

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,360
need to post a banner

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,880
saying that black lives matter there'll

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
be a link to some resources at the end

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,880
of this talk

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,040
and you are invited to take

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,760
responsibility for your own education

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,160
here

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,320
please do not put that labor on minority

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,519
members of our community

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,279
and if after taking time to reflect to

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,040
go through those resources and educate

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,680
yourself you still don't agree with a

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,160
vision

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,120
for an inclusive and welcoming community

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,120
well

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,959
open source has a built-in release valve

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,480
you're welcome to leave

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,480
meanwhile we have more work to do

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,519
we are now on our third generation of

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,120
leaders

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,040
and it is more important than ever for

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,720
us to reflect on our values

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,040
learn about our biases and our blind

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,519
spots lean into that

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,240
uncomfortable space of personal growth

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,839
and support

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,600
the next generation now to do this the

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,600
code of conduct committee is going to

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
take several concrete steps

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,000
we will improve transparency by

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,959
publishing a guide to our instant

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,120
incident report handling process which

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,560
is now on the site

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,800
we've opened up a public channel in

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,560
slack where folks can

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,800
reach us we're making ourselves more

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,519
accessible and that is in addition to

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
the private email address conduct

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,279
kubernetes

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,560
dot io starting next quarter we will

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,959
also begin publishing

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,920
transparency reports and to begin with

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,360
that'll cover

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,040
only issues happening outside of

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
conferences because we haven't had an

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,760
in-person conference in a minute

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,680
but we will ensure that no one can be

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,240
identified from these reports

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,079
while aiming to provide the community

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,160
with as much insight as we can

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,480
into the type of incidences that we do

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
handle

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,680
so in addition to that we've started

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,360
other initiatives to try and tackle some

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,440
of these problems

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,360
last year the linux foundation invested

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,120
forty thousand dollars into developing

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,200
and improving their unconscious bias

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,880
training course the steering committee

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
made this course a requirement for our

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
community group leaders our sigs

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,320
our working groups our user groups and

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,200
committee leads

00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,079
and while we recognize that taking one

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,600
course

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,839
isn't going to eliminate bias in our

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,959
community it is one piece of a larger

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,279
puzzle

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,160
but to be frank though we haven't done

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,399
enough

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,320
and it's a problem we need to fix this

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,079
is a cultural mission and we need to be

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,240
held accountable

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,440
there is no steering committee or cncf

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,760
policy that can just

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
fix this in one fell swoop this is a

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,040
problem in open source and the tech

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,040
industry at large

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,880
but we can take action here in our

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,120
community

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,800
we are all leaders our community has

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,440
hundreds of reviewers and approvers

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
that look after our code our docs our

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
policies and procedures

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,519
everything and we need to look out for

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,519
others too

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,959
next we want to remove more of the

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,279
barriers

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,720
to contributing itself by making

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,600
continuing the project more broadly

00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,519
accessible

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,839
in doing so we will open the doors to

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,000
many we used to run our new contributor

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
workshop alongside events like kubecon

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,519
but there are thousands of people that

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,519
weren't able to participate for

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,800
financial geopolitical technical or

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,560
other reasons

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,320
so to do this we are turning our new

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,440
contributor workshop into a free

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,279
online course lastly

00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,800
we are also expanding our mentorship and

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,160
internship programs both in the

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,120
conjunction with the cncf

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,959
and independently we have worked with

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,079
outreachy google summer of code

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,720
lfx and we want to work with others too

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,920
if this is something you or group you

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
work with is interested in

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,519
please reach out we have a lot of work

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,040
to do

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,079
thanks bob it sounds like there's so

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:46,399
much awesome stuff going on across

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,000
this entire community so folks if you'd

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
like to get involved

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,440
or reach out to any of us there's a

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,440
bunch of links up here and

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,120
again there's a link at the bottom of

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,399
the slide to additional resources to

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,600
educate yourself

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:03,040
thanks so much for coming to the talk
