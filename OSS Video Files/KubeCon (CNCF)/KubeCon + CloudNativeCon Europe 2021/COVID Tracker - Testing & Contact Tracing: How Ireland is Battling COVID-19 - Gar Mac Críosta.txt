[Music]

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,880
good morning good afternoon or good

00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,679
evening wherever you are

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,320
so um welcome to this session of kubecon

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,359
um

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,800
i am garma krista i am the hse lead the

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,480
hc is the health service executive in

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,880
ireland that the organization tasked

00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,480
with

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,760
both fighting covenant 19 but also

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,279
delivering health services to every

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
citizen in ireland

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,320
um and i'm the lead for the covent

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,920
tracker app which is our digital contact

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
racing solution i'm also chair of the

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,239
linux foundation public health advisory

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,239
committee

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,079
so um this is a story that happened

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,760
that started over a year ago for me um

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,120
it's a story about cover 19 i think we

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,600
all know what this is

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,280
um at that time so back in march of last

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,559
year uh we could see so it was like

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,079
glimpsing into the future we could see

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,879
what was happening in china we could see

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,360
what was happening

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,039
in in italy we could and we're now

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,239
seeing what's happening still and

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,239
it's it's awful to watch what's

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,800
happening in india at the moment but

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,439
we're seeing uh health systems come

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,640
under huge intense demand and dealing

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,840
with the capacity so you've got to find

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,439
a capacity when you're faced with

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,040
something like covet 19

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,880
and a challenge like that it's how you

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,400
deal with something like that

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,920
so at that time i was working in the

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
health service executive

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,000
uh so i work as a digital advisor for

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,040
the cio working on e-health projects and

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,159
a range of different things like that

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
across the board

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,560
and what my my background is i'm an

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
architect so uh like we got

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439
thrown into this it was myself another

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,840
guy called tim willoughby another guy

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,280
called

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
harrison were kind of at the heart of

00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,680
this but it was developing

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,960
um for trying to understand where we'd

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
use technology

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,320
to uh to help the fight against kobe 19

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,799
in particular with the

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,240
in the area of contact racing so caster

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,520
wins back to this time last year we

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,439
didn't know about apps we didn't know

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,119
about bluetooth-based

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,720
uh detection of contacts none of that

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,240
stuff existed it's all new

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,000
well the technology exists and the

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,000
ability to do it under proofs of concept

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,920
but certainly nothing that was kind of

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
um shovel ready to go

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,399
so the the graph that you're seeing at

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:05,360
the moment is the graph of cases

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,640
from march of last year to july which is

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,080
kind of the period that we were working

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,959
in so it was a very intense very short

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,399
period

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,160
and i think the reason i use it is

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,840
because it sets the context for just the

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,120
intensity because you could see this

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,239
mounting mounting mounting and we

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,680
actually thought that we didn't get

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,040
something done really quickly

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,319
that this would be over and it would be

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
pointless doing the things that we were

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
doing now it turns out that we were

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,520
wrong

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,280
that this has gone on an awful lot

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,000
longer than most people expected i think

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,040
it's uh it's met my expectations anyway

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,720
so um the challenge that we were set

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,160
ultimately was once we defined what the

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,080
problem was was trying to find two

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,519
people who were too close for too long

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,760
where one of them had tested positive

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,599
for for coping 19.

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,280
so we're subject to guidelines from the

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,959
european center for disease control they

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,440
had to find too close to two meters

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,879
um and too long is 15 minutes this is

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,879
obviously all been thrown out the window

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,400
with new variants p1107

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,920
which seems to have no respect for these

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,280
guidelines that were uh that were given

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,080
out by the european center for disease

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
control

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
and seems to want to go at further

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,120
distances and shorter time frames

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,400
but at that time that was what we were

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
working towards

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,159
so um neil and fred if neil has covert

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,159
and fred is too close we want to

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,959
identify fred and then get fred tested

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,159
to figure out

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,159
what's going on so the search begins

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,680
and again as i said we didn't know about

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,040
google apple exposure notification

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,760
system none of that

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,239
existed at this point in time so it

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,319
began

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,440
a search around what technologies could

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,440
we use and this

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,799
was wasn't just kind of um just a

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,480
desktop thing so we were actively

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,000
experimenting gathering data going out

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
testing things trying it

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,720
so the first incarnation in the app was

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,760
um a big data-based kind of geo-time box

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
piece where we're trying to put two

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,000
people in the same time box at the same

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,360
um in the same place and trying to

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
identify if that worked obviously

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,239
there's limitations with

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
uh gps in terms of what you can do with

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,680
that we looked at identifiers we looked

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,959
at kind of other location-based

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,799
technologies we looked at cold data

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,959
records from telcos we had social media

00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,720
data we looked at beacons we looked at

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,319
getting people to scan in with qr codes

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,120
et cetera et cetera et cetera so it was

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
a

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,640
and it was a big team and we're all

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,439
running in parallel trying to coordinate

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,239
and trying to

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,640
run as fast as we could so this is the

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,640
team

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,400
and it was a multi-agency wasn't just

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,599
the hse said the team included

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,159
people from the department of health

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,439
people from the hse people from um

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,760
so central governments the guy in the

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,400
middle of the top there is the cio for

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,840
for irish government we also had uh tim

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,600
willoughby from the police force andrew

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,919
sullivan from the police force we had

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,600
um we had the defense forces involved

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,600
with central statistics office organ

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
survey you name it anybody who could

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,320
help did help

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
in this effort and it all came together

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,880
very quickly most of us have never

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,320
worked together before

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,080
so for anybody who's been in that

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
situation the usual forming storming

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,320
norming

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,600
happened at an incredible rate as people

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
trying to figure we're trying to figure

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
out how do they help each other and how

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,600
they work together

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,000
so also what was happening is around the

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,199
world

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,199
everybody else was trying to solve a

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,400
similar problem and singapore were ahead

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,919
of the game because they could see this

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,120
happening they'd been through situations

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,120
like this before

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,639
they activated their their digital

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,080
government team and a guy called jason

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,080
they led a team that released trace

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,240
together which was the first

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,199
and i i guess it's the first bluetooth

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,320
proximity based

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,880
contact detection system is born so it

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,639
comes up

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,320
and it's using bluetooth as an

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,240
estimation for distance and then i'm

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,759
recording time so have i seen this phone

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,639
have i seen this phone again have i seen

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,800
this phone

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,880
enough times within a 15 minute period

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,759
to count like to call it

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,160
a valid close contact and for anybody

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,240
who's familiar with the bluetooth stack

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,199
that's not a great it's it's not

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,639
specifically

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,240
designed for something like that so a

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,520
lot of the work that's been going on has

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,680
really been in terms of

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,880
trying to understand what it can do

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
where it can't do

00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,639
um its abilities in different phones if

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,680
you've got different antenna arrays and

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,440
different phones there's different

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,960
signal strengths coming off it

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,320
so the transmission power comes into

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,440
play so there's a bunch of different

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,680
things to do with

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
bluetooth that we um which i wasn't very

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720
familiar with beforehand but i i could

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,919
have speed pretty quickly

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,000
to try and solve some of these problems

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,240
another piece that happened at that time

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,600
as well was uh this debate was raging

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,520
around centralization versus

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
decentralization so this is the idea

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
that

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,960
i'm collecting information about the

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,560
people you've met or am i collecting

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,319
information about you

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
and making that available to the people

00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,280
you've met should should one or either

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
of you text positive

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,639
and it became this good versus evil

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,240
debate but actually if you look at

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
how public health works and how content

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,080
tracing works contact tracing works by

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,759
developing graphs and networks of people

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,680
so it's knowing who the index patient is

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,240
who's the person who's tested positive

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,759
and tracing it through to other people

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,120
in that chain and trying to follow that

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,800
around and if you try and have a

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
conversation with heads of public health

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,880
which i did

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
and explain to them how we're going to

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,560
do this and not have an index patient

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
there is this baffled look as they've

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,360
never considered a world without an

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,319
index patient because it's not the way

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,120
they think

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,960
however there are concerns around if i'm

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
developing this massive graph of every

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,919
connection with every person

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,360
then what are the impacts of that and

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,120
what does that mean because obviously it

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,400
has privacy implications as well

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,880
and a breach in a system like that would

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,039
be chronic so

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,560
this whole thing this whole episode was

00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,520
a series of trade-offs it was a series

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
of proofs

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,599
and again from uh from operating inside

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,440
of uh government

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,880
a lot of things some things take time

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,560
like government is actually quite good

00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,919
in situations in crisis in terms of

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,639
responding quickly

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,080
but usually the default is we'll take

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
our time we'll do the analysis we'll

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,240
work through this

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,919
and seeing is believing so our first

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,280
working prototypes were within a couple

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,560
of days of us starting

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
so we were showing people the whole way

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,880
through and just making sure and

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,080
bringing them on that journey and

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,960
building confidence that we could

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
actually do this

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,800
because it was a novel technology in a

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,960
novel space under incredible pressure so

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,880
how do we do something like that

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,080
and the critics define the meme space so

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,360
the meme space is kind of

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,199
the stories that were kind of going

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,960
around in the media at that time the

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,960
screamers the superstars the concerned

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,680
idealists the uber experts they were all

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
there

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,759
and this was going to be the end of days

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,120
as far as some people were concerned

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,960
the key thing that came out was around

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,560
demand for transparency and we had

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,280
committed very early on to open source

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,680
this

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,360
at the start it um i guess

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
it was in our heads to do it but we were

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,319
kind of working so fast that it was kind

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,280
of a it basically became an

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,199
afterthought so we were kind of said

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,800
we'll get to that piece but actually

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,000
uh open sourcing the technology and

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,479
making it available and making it

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,319
visible

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,080
and sharing the data protection impact

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,680
assessment doing all of these things led

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,800
to an increased transparency and that

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,919
drove trust

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,599
and i think trust is one of the

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,520
underpinning things in terms of success

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,800
of these apps

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,560
so um we hit a point where we could not

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,000
get bluetooth working in the background

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,599
it just didn't work didn't work reliably

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,479
on apple there was challenges on android

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,959
as well

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,560
and uh you can kind of either face into

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,080
a and keep fighting and keep fighting

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,120
fighting fighting or

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,560
you can decide you're going to take a

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,839
different path and see if you can do it

00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,519
in a different way and we were

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,279
constantly so all that the

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,640
options that we were exploring earlier

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,040
we kept all of those options on the

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
board

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,080
it wasn't like we doubled down we were

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,920
kind of committed to building

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,680
a like a bluetooth-based content tracing

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,640
app but we were also keeping other

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,839
options open

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,160
and making sure that we have that

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,440
optionality as part of our

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,440
the landscape for us so

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,360
google and apple then stepped in this

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,959
was kind of april of last year

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,399
and announced that they were releasing

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,399
this google google apple

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,920
google google apple exposure

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:13,120
notification system

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,560
now that had two things for us one is it

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
solved our problem in that

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,760
they would solve the technology problems

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,000
which meant we had ultimately had to rip

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,000
out about 10 000 lines of code

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,360
the other side of this was that and we

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
actually went from centralized to

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,640
decentralized

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
which pleased the privacy people but at

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,959
the same time we don't have the

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,640
trade-off for the public health people

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,320
to explain to them that you're losing an

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,760
index patient you will no longer have

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,360
that connection that hard strong

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,160
connection between the two people

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,839
one who infected another person then

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,600
understanding how that works inside of a

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,959
contact racing system that's designed

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,160
around index patients

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,600
that becomes a challenge as well so

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,279
we were revealing this really fast

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
amazon were helping us with a dev team

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,200
called near form

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,640
and who were like building the building

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,760
the tech they're a major contributor

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,000
into node

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,440
they work in these kind of crazy insane

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,279
projects all of the time

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,200
so we were kind of working with them uh

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
testing from explio we had security and

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,240
privacy guys from a company called isas

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,440
plus all this government help working in

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
different directions but amazon were

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
there as well so we were working with

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
amazon

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
to help define this and get there as

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,800
quickly as we could so we committed

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,200
early on

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
to use native services and that was a

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,079
commitment at that point in time and it

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,440
was really driven by

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,959
the time constraints and just making

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,519
sure that we could make this thing work

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,079
day one

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,240
out of the box and we subsequently built

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,760
an interoperability architecture which

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,519
allowed us to so we were the first

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,480
country to deliver interoperability

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,920
anywhere globally

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,279
um and that was between us and northern

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,079
ireland so we've got a shared border on

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,680
the island

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,760
and we want to make sure that people can

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,760
travel over and back across that border

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,360
with ease and that was in terms of

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,079
opening up movement and travel and then

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,920
subsequently

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,920
we were part of the first group uh the

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,360
first wave as we were opening up and

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
interoperating with europe

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,120
so that then became another program as

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,959
we went through it

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
but meanwhile in other news so we

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
weren't the only show in town

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,279
so you i think we've seen probably more

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,000
transformation

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,360
and more more incredible work going on

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,519
inside of government

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,600
in this country and governments around

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,600
the world in the past 12 months

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,959
then like it's just been incredible in

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
terms of the pace of change

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,079
but covert 19 was just impacting all

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,519
over the place

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
and that's where kubernetes came into

00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,920
the round to the rescue so it's

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,440
underpinning

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,959
clinical information systems it's

00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,040
underpinning um

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,640
kind of future uh future pieces around

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,519
how we do healthcare integration across

00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,000
the sector

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,320
so there's a lot of work there that um

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,440
it's it's really been pivotal in terms

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,800
of building reliable robust

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
infrastructures underneath that

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,240
that can cater with the load and it's a

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,000
lot of systems really weren't designed

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,760
to kind of work in this way or

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,680
scale to the to the demands that they

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,120
were kind of facing and covered really

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,440
beat the crap out of a lot of things

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,560
and so technologies like kubernetes and

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,079
some of the other technologies that

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,079
we're looking at from cncf are going to

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,240
play a pivotal part in how we kind of

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,680
rebuild and reinvest in in

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,880
infrastructure across the board and i

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,399
don't think it's not it's not just

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,000
health i think it's more broadly across

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,880
government

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,639
so 110 days later so we had the app in

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,160
the app store after 100 days

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,000
like ready to go in the app store in the

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,000
play store we were then without

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,160
government because we had an election

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,160
earlier on this year or only around last

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,639
year it all the time gets compressed

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,000
during covert so we have this um we had

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,880
an election that had

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,399
been run covet hit we got stuck it was

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,360
determined that this recorded cabinet

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,639
decision to go live

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
because it was seen as putting health in

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,560
everybody's pocket so it was a big

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
decision

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,320
so this was the first decision that this

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,000
new government that we have now made was

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,639
to go live with this app

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,639
so we went live on the 7th of july it's

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,480
a fully integrated

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,560
content pricing solutions so it

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,320
integrates into the core manual contact

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,839
tracing piece that's there

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,760
and so it's an end-to-end so it's

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,360
seamless it's not just a piece a

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,880
piece of technology that sits on its own

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,160
and does its own thing it's it's

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,720
integrated into the entire system so

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,720
7th of july we went live today we've got

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,800
right now we've got 1.3 million people

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,399
on the platform we've had 15 000 people

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,880
who've tested positive and uploaded

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,680
their

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
um their diagnosis keys we've notified

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,360
over 30 000 people

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,120
most of them are contactable um but we

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
have a symptom checking feature in the

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
app and we've had 60 million check-ins

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
on the

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,959
symptom checker we're interoperable with

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,519
europe we're interoperable with northern

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,079
ireland

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,680
um 10 plus releases at this point but

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,040
the code we contributed the code into

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,760
the linux foundation public health

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,600
project

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
and it's now being used in wholerain

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
part in 10

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,240
10 implementations and there's more

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,880
coming so

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,560
and it's working in that it's doing its

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,320
job it's doing what it's meant to do

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,000
could work better absolutely but as we

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,600
learn about this technology

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
we're constantly tweaking and tuning and

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,880
understanding as our google and apple so

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,199
we're kind of working on this to try and

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,600
understand how it works better

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,959
so i think you're never going to please

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,560
anybody but one of the things that

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,000
happened was that

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,360
the approach we had taken the open

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,399
sourcing and the transparency around

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,040
what we were doing

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,399
actually went over a lot of privacy well

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,519
people who would typically be critical

00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,040
of these kind of moves

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,480
were actually won over in terms of this

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,800
is a model for how we do things like

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
this into the future

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,720
the next steps well it's a global impact

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
thing so uh as i said it's in ten

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,000
different implementations we gave it

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,079
into the linux foundation public health

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,079
project as a contribution in there we're

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,760
actively participating in that group

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,519
with other public health authorities

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,000
trying to figure out different ways

00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,079
not just to solve problems of covert 19

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,079
but also to look at preparing for a

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,560
future so what happens post pandemic

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,399
response toolkits what do they look like

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:31,600
and then other broader public health

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,600
issues that we face

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,639
so i guess uh for many of you and i know

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,040
this is an audience from around the

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,480
world

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,079
this will mean nothing but there's a

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,519
satirical newspaper in ireland called

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,560
watford whispers that

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
um is usually skewing um anything that's

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,720
done

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,320
by government anything that's done by

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,040
public figures anything that's done by

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,199
celebrities

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,880
usually gets secured on the front of it

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,440
when this headline came out

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,120
and that was august of last year or yeah

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,639
it was actually august when it came out

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,240
but it was to do with july

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,519
and there had been so much chatter on

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,880
social media there'd been so much

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,399
chatter around the world about how this

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,639
whole thing would work

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,079
the uh the relief that we had and i know

00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,519
it seems like a very small win but when

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,839
you're not being secured on the front of

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,839
it

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,680
when you're not the subject of the joke

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,000
then and somebody else is but

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,600
you're being used as part of that piece

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,120
uh there was a certain sense of

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,959
of relief a little bit of schadenfreude

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,240
if i'm honest so

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,839
um this is uh this is me if you want to

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,320
find out about covert green the link to

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,000
the

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,399
uh to the open source repository is

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,079
there uh welcome anybody who wants to

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,680
ask any questions welcome anybody who

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,880
wants to come in and join the community

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,079
as well and help

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,440
because i think what we're trying to do

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,320
with the linux foundation public health

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,920
project

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
is really bring some of this stuff

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,079
together and bring some of the

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,839
the uh the enthusiasm the minds and that

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,480
that open source community thing which

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,240
is

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
for ireland it was one of the first real

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,920
true experiences in terms of how this

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,120
can actually help us solve some of the

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,079
major problems that we've got in the

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,759
world

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:57,839
thank you all for that and i hope that

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,839
