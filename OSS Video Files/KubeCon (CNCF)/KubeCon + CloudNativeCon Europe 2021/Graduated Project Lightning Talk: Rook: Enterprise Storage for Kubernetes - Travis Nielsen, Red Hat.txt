Graduated Project Lightning Talk: Rook: Enterprise Storage for Kubernetes - Travis Nielsen, Red Hat

All Kubernetes clusters require storage! But how do you configure and manage it? Come catch a glimpse of how Rook provides an enterprise storage platform to the community as an upstream and open-source project, available to any Kubernetes cluster, whether running on-prem or in the cloud. Rook was accepted as a graduated project by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation in October 2020.
