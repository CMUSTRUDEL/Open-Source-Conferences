so i think we're well on our journey

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,000
towards kubernetes being boring

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,560
maybe after i retire it will never be

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,720
boring

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,080
it's already boring as soon as we can

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,600
make it boring

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,360
it'll only be boring when it's done

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:43,130
it'll only be done when it's

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:50,080
no longer relevant

00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:57,840
