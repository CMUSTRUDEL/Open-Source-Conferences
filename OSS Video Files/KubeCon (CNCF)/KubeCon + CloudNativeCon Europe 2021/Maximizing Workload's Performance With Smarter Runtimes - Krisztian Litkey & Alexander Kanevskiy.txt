Maximizing Workload's Performance With Smarter Runtimes - Krisztian Litkey & Alexander Kanevskiy, Intel

Mitigating noisy neighbours in the world of containers is not an easy task. There are several solutions exists and many of those have own limitations. This presentation will be focusing on exploring new ways of innovations for container runtimes that helps get maximum performance and resource utilisation without modifications of the workloads. In this talk we are planning to briefly cover existing extension points for containerd and CRI-O, talk about new ideas from NRI proposal, as well as covering evolution of dynamic resource usage optimisations in our project CRI-Resource-Manager. We want to share our experience on dealing with heterogenous CPU resources, multi-tiered Memory, Caches, Memory Bandwidth and Block I/O usage. We want to demonstrate how using various metrics and hints provided by Linux kernel can lead to improvements of workload performance and dynamic hardware resource utilisation optimisations.
