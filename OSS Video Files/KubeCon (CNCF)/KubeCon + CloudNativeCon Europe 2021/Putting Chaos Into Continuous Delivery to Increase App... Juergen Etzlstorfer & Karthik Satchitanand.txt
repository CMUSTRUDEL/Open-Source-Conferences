Putting Chaos Into Continuous Delivery to Increase Application Resiliency - Juergen Etzlstorfer, Dynatrace & Karthik Satchitanand, Mayadata

Continuous Delivery practices have evolved significantly with the cloud-native paradigm. GitOps & Chaos Engineering are at the forefront of this new CD approach, with an ever-increasing pattern involving Git-backed pipeline definitions that implement “chaos stages” in pre-prod environments to gauge SLO compliance. In this talk, maintainers of the Keptn (Juergen) & LitmusChaos (Karthik) CNCF sandbox projects will discuss how you can construct pipelines that include chaos experimentation (mapped to declarative hypothesis around application steady-state) while simulating real-world load, and implement quality gates to ensure resilient applications are deployed into production. All this - in a GitOps native manner. They will also demonstrate how you can include chaos tests to your existing CD pipelines without the need of rewriting them.
