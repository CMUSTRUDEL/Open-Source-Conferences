Panel: Your Path To Non-code Contribution In The Kubernetes Community - Kaslin Fields, Google; Kat Cosgrove, JFrog; Matt Broberg, Red Hat; Kohei Ota, HPE

Your first look at the Kubernetes community can be intimidating. This talk is here to reassure you: whatever skills you have, Kubernetes needs them. Our panel of contributors, new and old, will talk through their unique experiences and how you can get involved. We will talk through the specific ways non-code contribution helps Kubernetes be a fun, inclusive, and expanding community and how you can be part of it. We will highlight how SIG Contribution Experience is the "front door" to your experience and provide examples of the remarkable ways people show up for others in our community. Examples include spinning up a baking show, administrating communication tools, writing blog posts, and much more. If you have an hour a week or 8 hours a day, we'll help you spend your time wisely and see how valuable you are as a contributor.
