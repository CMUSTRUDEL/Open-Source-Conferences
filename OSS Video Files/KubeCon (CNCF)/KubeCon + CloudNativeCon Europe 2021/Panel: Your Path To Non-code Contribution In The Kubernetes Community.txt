Panel: Your Path To Non-code Contribution In The Kubernetes Community - Kaslin Fields, Google; Kat Cosgrove, JFrog; Matt Broberg, Red Hat; Kohei Ota, HPE

Your first look at the Kubernetes community can be intimidating. This talk is here to reassure you: whatever skills you have, Kubernetes needs them. Our panel of contributors, new and old, will talk through their unique experiences and how you can get involved. We will talk through the specific ways non-code contribution helps Kubernetes be a fun, inclusive, and expanding community and how you can be part of it. We will highlight how SIG Contribution Experience is the "front door" to your experience and provide examples of the remarkable ways people show up for others in our community. Examples include spinning up a baking show, administrating communication tools, writing blog posts, and much more. If you have an hour a week or 8 hours a day, we'll help you spend your time wisely and see how valuable you are as a contributor.

hi all welcome to our panel this is

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,359
about non-code contribution

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,000
and the premise of this is that hundreds

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,080
of people

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
are regularly contributing code

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,639
supporting build infrastructure

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,759
and collaborating with the fluency of

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,359
git and github

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,279
that's required to contribute to

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,520
kubernetes day-to-day or what is

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,840
believed to be required to contribute

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,560
and this panel of people we all are

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,960
contributing

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,199
in different ways we're doing non-code

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,920
contribution and by that we mean

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,960
we we contribute without needing to use

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,520
git or github

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,640
and are adding value in other ways to

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,840
the ecosystem

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,360
and we want to tell you a little about

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,200
that so that you're more aware of the

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,120
broader range of contribution

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,480
and to inspire you to do so if you're

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,640
into it so

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
we've got a wonderful panel today first

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,399
we'll just ask people to introduce

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,600
themselves

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:54,399

uh give lg tms to the translators

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,960
contribution that's amazing and kat

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,880
hello everybody my name is kat cosgrove

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,920
i'm a developer advocate

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,479
at jfrog i'm also a

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,759
co-chair of cloud native tv which you

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,119
should have heard about by now

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,520
if not stay tuned um

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,400
i'm also one of the people responsible

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,319
for the

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,440
infamous uh docker shim conflagration

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,120
oh yeah i remember that yeah everybody

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
does unfortunately

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,599
and we'll talk about that uh later or at

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,640
least i will

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,000
but my my contributions to the cloud

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,319
native computing foundation and the

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
whole ecosystem have primarily been

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,959
community and social media based so i

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,319
will have a slightly different

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,599
perspective

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,480
yeah and i'm matt broberg i'm based out

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,160
of the midwest

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,680
and appreciate like we're all in

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,400
different places so one of the

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,200
advantages

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,760
of this word weird and wonderful virtual

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,360
space is we can all be here together

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,680
and and do this talk and i am a

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
red hat working on an editorial called

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,080
enable architect

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,920
we write about it architectures

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,360
but i've been contributing to sig

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,440
contributor experience for a couple

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
years and then i helped start the

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,319
working group

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
upstream marketing slash contributor

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,519
comms that

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,640
kazan and i jam on and we'll talk more

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,400
about that

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,840
so maybe that's a good place to kick off

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,480
so how

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,879
how did you get started in this non-code

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,599
contributing space for kubernetes

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,680
i feel like cat you started to go into

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,159
docker shim and i feel like this is just

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
a great you know starting place for us

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,519
let's get into the weeds

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,519
yeah we'll just go straight into the

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,159
fire so i've i've never actually

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
contributed code back to any cncf

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,280
project

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,200
before and i don't think there's

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
anything wrong with that what i did do

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,280
is get very heavily involved in the cncf

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,720
community

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,000
i used the tools so i

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,159
felt that it was important to give back

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,519
by supporting the community and

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,400
at one point um last year

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,360
there was a thing is it last year i

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,159
don't

00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,040
time is irrelevant at this point in the

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,159
panera so

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
it could have been a few months ago it

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,920
could have been last year i'd believe

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,360
you regardless of what you told me but

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,319
so in order to use the entire docker

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,239
tech stack

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,880
as your container runtime inside of

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,120
kubernetes kubernetes requires a

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
software shim and we call that software

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,880
shim docker shim

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,320
it's sole purpose is to get at the

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,720
actual container runtime

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,160
inside of the docker stack which i think

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,120
is container d

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,680
actually but there was an announcement

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
made

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,160
that the docker shim was going to be

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
deprecated because it's a separate thing

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,600
for the cncf to maintain that's kind of

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,440
a pain

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,440
it's unfair we've been talking about

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,800
deprecating this thing for quite a while

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320
now

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,320
and the announcement of that deprecation

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,320
created a lot of confusion initially

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,880
so i wrote a like 13 tweet long

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,680
thread explaining what the docker shim

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,600
is

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,520
and what's happening and why you

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,840
shouldn't panic about this

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,520
and it immediately went viral to an

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,960
extent that i was at the time extremely

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,360
uncomfortable with because i wasn't used

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,960
to having that much attention online

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,240
but this was ultimately an extremely

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,520
positive contribution

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,919
to the community the cncf underestimated

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,199
the way that deprecation would affect

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,639
some users

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,520
and didn't really take into account

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,039
what people knew about docker shim

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,120
people tend to conflate docker and

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,960
kubernetes a lot when they don't

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,400
understand kubernetes super well which

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
isn't a bad thing it's entirely

00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
understandable

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,320
but it created a lot of drama and

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:45,080
i helped solve that drama by

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:48,400
being helpful and being being a positive

00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:50,240
non-judgmental source of information

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,759
in the community and that's that's an

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,840
important contribution that any of you

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,440
can make

00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,800
cat just mentioned about the docker

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,919
uh shame deprecation rate uh i also uh

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,639
was in involved with that a little bit

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,600
so like i basically uh saw a lot of

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,000
dramas

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
over there on twitter and you know other

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,199
social medias too

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,720
so uh yeah cat also posted the

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,680
kubernetes blog post right and i

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,240
did uh so we were basically in the slack

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
chat

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,600
we were discussing about how do we

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,120
proceed how do we post

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,240
uh to make other people not

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,319
panic panic anymore right so yeah we

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,240
were editing in the google doc and like

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,520
uh collaborating with each other

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,840
and yeah i i helped that a bit

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,680
and also i posted the blog post in

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,800
japanese too because

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,160
it was a really huge rage

00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,720
in japan as well yeah so yeah a lot of

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,759
people

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,599
were already um

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,000
i don't know how to describe this yeah

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,039
but they're basically panicking so

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,680
yeah yeah and you and you gave them what

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,960
they needed

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,720
in in japanese and that it sounds like

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,919
you were also helping with the english

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,680
messaging so that's uh that's incredible

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,800
that's a great combination of your

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,960
skills and

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,800
we needed everyone we could get that

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,800
week in the kubernetes community

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,360
like everybody was panicking and there

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,120
was like a dozen people in that slack

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,319
channel like trying to cram together a

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,440
blog post and an faq to

00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,240
stem the tide of people who were

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,479
very scared and they didn't understand

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,720
why they shouldn't be scared

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,680
the six hours were really um dramatic

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,240
very dramatic extremely we all deserve

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,039
t-shirts for that frankly

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,759
oh docker shim fan club i feel like it's

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,720
a really

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,319
solid group that we can maybe it's a new

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,680
working group we can

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,080
sponsor well before we get too far down

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,360
that

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,199
uh inside joke pulling it back up to

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
other non-code contributions caslin can

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,039
you talk about uh what you've been up to

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,639
yeah so matt will be thoroughly aware of

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,800
the types of work that i've been doing

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,560
with the community uh

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,319
to get into the community though i'll

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,520
talk a little bit about how i

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,919
ended up here uh well to start off

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,520
i developed an interest in kubernetes

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,639
and containers by having a bunch of

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,280
friends who are just really

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,680
interested in containers and kubernetes

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,520
so

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,759
over time they got me involved in their

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,240
hobbies which was great i always love it

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,240
when people share their passions with me

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,279
so i got more and more involved in it

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,279
and i

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,719
my career kind of started to shift

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,240
towards kubernetes

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,600
and containers and i wanted to get

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,760
involved with the community because i've

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,440
been to some cube cons and some meetups

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
and i saw that everyone was so nice and

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,240
everyone was always

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
saying how wonderful it was to

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,040
contribute and how everyone was welcome

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,200
so i started trying to find a place

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
within the kubernetes community

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,480
and i first started looking at maybe

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
like sig storage or

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,519
stick testing because i come from a test

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,480
engineer so i started looking at those

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,080
but with my workload at the time and the

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,160
types of projects that those

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,519
groups were doing it kept not really

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,800
working out but then

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,200
i found this contributor marketing group

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,839
which might sound a little weird

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,560
marketing

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
is in the title so people are like what

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,399
what does that mean

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,399
it sounds not that fun

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,800
i feel like some people feel that way i

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,120
hope this pitch is pivoting but yeah

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,680
yeah but engineers maybe not

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,880
find it interesting it's so true though

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,279
it's so true

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,200
yeah some people feel that way about it

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,839
but what i love about it

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,440
is i get a really broad view over the

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,959
kubernetes ecosystem

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,279
and i get to help people like kat was

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,080
saying so our goal with the contributor

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,640
marketing group

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,399
is to tell the world about the wonderful

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,959
things that kubernetes contributors are

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,720
doing

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,079
and to help kubernetes contributors

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,519
connect with each other and see

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,920
what each other is doing so

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,440
being able to to kind of get that

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,560
overarching view

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,360
of the cigs and help them to communicate

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,200
with the world

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,720
all the awesome stuff they're doing is

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,680
what gets me really excited about the

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,279
work that we do in

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,079
in the contributor marketing team which

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:28,079
involves things like uh blog posts

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,279
we also helped out with the docker shim

00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,880
blog post a little bit

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,640
he did thank you and also the twitter we

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,839
have a twitter handle at kate's

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,360
contributors

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
where we actually have a bot on github

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
so that

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,079
any kubernetes contributor who wants to

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,440
participate in that

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,200
twitter account if they want to tweet

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,680
something about the work they're doing

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,839
they can submit a tweet to the github

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,120
repo and we have a github action

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,839
that will turn that uh pull request into

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,760
a tweet

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,920
once it's merged into the repo which is

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,000
really cool oh i didn't know that that's

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,720
so cool that's a huge motivator for me i

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,399
love attention

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:09,839
that is cool i love that please use it

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,880
oh i'm going to because i love attention

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:16,640
and that and

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:20,160
possibly by the time this uh goes live

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,720
we have a pr in progress to make that

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,560
so that somebody can just comment in a

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
github issue and once it gets approved

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,959
there's an issue it automatically sends

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,640
the tweet

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,240
so you don't even need the pr you don't

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,720
need the git foo

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,279
uh that were you know part of what we're

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,760
saying is

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,399
we're trying to create a home for people

00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,399
for more

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,920
non-code contribution because there's so

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
many talented people

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,360
who are tweeting and translating and

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,120
just and

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,000
drawing uh their way into contribution

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
and those are all valuable ways in which

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
we

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
expand our community yeah we still need

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,000
all of that like we we desperately need

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,920
all of that it can't just all be code

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,959
then we have no personality and we have

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,600
no

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:06,399
community so yeah we need the flavor

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,000
yeah yeah so caslin i i queued you up a

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,720
little i just wanted to say like

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,040
your artwork is incredible and i feel

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,480
like

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,480
it's part of what's about to say that

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,959
too go for it go for it

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,560
yeah i love your comicalization that's

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,800
really amazing

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,959
that's so nice of you so one way

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,720
that i know some other people as well

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
have started contributing to open source

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,440
projects is to contribute their art

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,079
skills that's a great

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,680
point for a non-code contribution we've

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
talked about blog posts

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,279
um we've talked about translating

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,880
documentation into

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,760
into many languages and another way is

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,880
to help with

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,040
illustration i do illustrations for

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,320
blog posts i do my own little

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,279
illustrations for

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,000
talks and things and so sometimes people

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,600
will ask me

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
within the community to help them

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,399
explain a concept and

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
uh help to do it through visualizations

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
and

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,480
that's one way that i really like to

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,760
help people so um so something i wanted

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,160
to

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,160
ask you all is like what's what's

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,279
something about non-code contribution

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,079
that uh is like bringing a different

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,040
sort of value to the community that

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,279
people might not

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,120
know about um first one that comes to

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,880
mind for me to queue it up is like i'm

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,160
really blown away at the people

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,519
that volunteer their time to run

00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,120
events especially in the year the kovid

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
like there have been people have spent

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,880
countless hours to curate

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,519
experiences for us uh and to

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,040
connect us despite us being very far

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,199
away from each other and

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,639
yes very stressed and and going through

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,959
a lot collectively

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,680
there have been those moments of either

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,360
jumping on

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,240
like a short video or a twitch stream or

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,839
in animal crossing for some like just

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,560
some place where people are getting

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,279
together

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,560
and feeling connected i i know that how

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,399
much work that takes

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,079
i'm not great at it myself and i'm so

00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,800
glad other people show up and do

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,839
it so what are some ways that like

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,959
people surprise you with their

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,000
contribution that you

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,760
want to give a shout out to i will

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,079
literally always give a shout out to

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,040
austin parker for the animal crossing

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,760
conference for deserted island devops um

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,959
which was

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:23,360
a very very heavily container

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,480
technology because both myself and ian

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,279
coldwater spoke

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,440
at the first one but that was

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,320
we caught lightning in a bottle with

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,320
that conference

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:40,160
and it remains the most wholesome

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,320
uh pure uplifting conference experience

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,959
of my entire life and it's my literal

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,839
job to attend conferences

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,760
and i i really don't think i could give

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,360
him enough accolades for that running a

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,160
conference is hard

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,399
running events is hard especially now so

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,360
literally anybody who is doing that

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,160
now in a way that's still very community

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,199
oriented

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,440
deserves uh the biggest hug i'm allowed

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,760
to give you as soon as it's safe

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,199
because uh we're we're all trapped in

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,880
our apartments and that is a

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,120
really really valuable contribution

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,920
right people learn in different ways

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,959
and some people need the social aspect

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,440
in order to

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,720
like learn a new technology i do

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,079
personally i

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,120
like to i read the docs by myself alone

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,519
but then i want to like

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,399
watch somebody else hack it out and i

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,600
can't do that

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,160
without live events or virtual events or

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,920
whatever

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,600
so uh big appreciation to anybody

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,360
who is capable mentally of putting

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:47,600
together a virtual event

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:50,560
in present day uh also shout out to

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,199
i guess kubecon because we're doing that

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
right now

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,480
that's that's literally what we're doing

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,480
right now nothing it's pretty big

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,199
well said cat thank you yeah so i i

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,360
i was actually really surprised when i

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,320
firstly got involved with kubernetes

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,120
community

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,600
because i just imagined like there would

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,800
be

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,519
just bunch of a lot of like uh awesome

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
programmers

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:20,079
that are considered as experts right

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,639
but you know once i get involved

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,920
i i see a lot of like uh beginners which

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,880
is also a good thing

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,000
absolutely and also like uh you know

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,720
there are a lot of like

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,639
subgroups called sig right for example

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
like sick dogs and sick contributor

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,000
experience just you know

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,160
we were just talking about and i was

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
like uh this seems to be like i'm i've

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,399
never been involved with there

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,000
but uh sick naming and sick release

00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,639
there are a lot of things that you don't

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,839
have to

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,880
like uh um necessarily

00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,000
um have the great coding skills but i

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,160
was like uh

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,279
you just basically need a common sense

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,880
right yeah

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,639
so um so they're actually like a lot of

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,120
technical writers and like

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,400
project managers like not just you know

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,319
pure programmers

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,520
which is good and there are a lot of

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,480
areas of interest

00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,039
to their which is so cool that people of

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,199
different

00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,959
interests have different uh areas where

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,720
they can do more contributing so that

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
they can

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,480
so in a way it is okay to uh for you to

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,319
have a

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,839
like a biased opinion about things

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:26,000
because there are a lot of people

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,720
and who can discuss about it so as long

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,360
as the discussion is fine that's fine so

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,360
like uh

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,559
you don't have to have the whole

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,559
interest right

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,640
uh i want to involve like i want to

00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,120
contribute to this this but i don't want

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,600
to

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,000
contribute to this that's fine right you

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,840
can start from the small place

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,360
yeah that's a really that's really great

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,360
universal advice like

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,480
if you're newer and you're interested in

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,400
contributing

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,320
you might see the list of 30 plus

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,880
special interest groups the sigs and be

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
like

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
okay maybe i'll just show up to each one

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,280
of these real quick and then you look at

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960
the year calendar

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:04,240
and that's 40 plus hours of activity

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,080
in less time than you have uh so

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,720
the acknowledgment that like you can

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,760
choose a place and go contribute in your

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,000
unique way

00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,840
and we need expertise of all kinds like

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,799
product management is an expertise and

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,559
product marketing

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,840
and engineering and engineering

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,720
management and

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,039
just program and product management is

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,919
is

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,960
wild i'm seeing a lot more participation

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,919
from people

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,480
with those skill sets and scrum masters

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,480
it feels more friendly for

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,880
newcomers this way because there are

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,000
more specific options you don't have to

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,880
dive in

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,400
with both feet this way and also if you

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,840
don't know where you want to start

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,200
because you're so new that all this is

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,160
overwhelming

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,640
that's what people like me and caslin

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,840
are

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:55,360
for like we're we

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,400
are the like front-facing community

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,120
part of this and i guess matt to an

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
extent too

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,880
don't you do that too matt yeah i'm into

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,799
it

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,120
so like that's what we're for and you

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,880
can talk to us like

00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,799
just just reach out to us and we're

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,320
happy to answer questions and talk to

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,520
you about this kind of stuff and help

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,400
you

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,600
find a home you know like ultimately

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,080
that's what we want we

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,679
we want to build a better community

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,799
which takes all kinds of people whether

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,840
you write code

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:28,640
or not and

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,160
build better tools out of that like

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,880
building good tools isn't just writing

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,640
good code

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,460
and also you know good code may or may

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,840
not even actually exist

00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,240
[Laughter]

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,520
so

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,360
yeah constantly improving is probably

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,640
the the best goal we can set out these

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,440
days

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,080
we've hit a lot of different topics um

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,400
all around

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,320
non-code so maybe we'll start going into

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,120
what's some advice you have for people

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,679
who

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,559
are interested and may not know how to

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,840
start

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:02,559
contributing to kubernetes or

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,080
contributing in a non-code way any

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,559
advice that comes to mind that we

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:09,600
haven't covered yet

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,679
um i think

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,039
as far as tech communities i've been

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,760
involved in

00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:16,720
which at this point is quite a lot the

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,760
cncf

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,640
is one of the most social and one of the

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,320
most

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,400
welcoming of all of them so

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,320
i i would reiterate my previous advice

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,200
and say just talk to us

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,679
i don't actually work for the cncf i am

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,720
just

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,440
a community member who ended up with a

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,320
voice

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,039
and stuck around and that that can be

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,039
you too

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,400
and that for me started by just talking

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,159
to people

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,080
and uh you don't you don't need to be

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,840
scared of any of us or anything we're

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,520
not

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,360
untouchable um we we would like we would

00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:54,640
like to have you

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,400
so talk to us please

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,159
and we'll find you a thing to do because

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,200
there's stuff to do there's like so much

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,840
stuff to do

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
so we can find you some stuff to do

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,840
should i go next yeah hit it

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,919
i i feel like the advice that i often

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,000
give boiled down into

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,159
kind of a single phrase is

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,679
contributing to open source is learning

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,600
in public

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,520
something i was really intimidated by

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,080
when i wanted to start getting

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,679
involved with open source was i have no

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,080
idea how to do this and i'm gonna make

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,200
so many mistakes everybody's gonna find

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,559
out that i'm

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,200
don't know what i'm doing but what i

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,600
learned

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,880
is that everybody doesn't know what

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,640
they're doing sometimes

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,480
and we're all just doing it anyway

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,240
because we really love these open source

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,039
projects in our communities and

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,960
the technology and so we all work

00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:53,039
together and we learn in public

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,400
you can see our mistakes they're out

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,720
there to see

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,159
but we do our best to learn from them

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,480
and move past them and

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,520
all work together to make something

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,000
really great

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,480
so you'll you'll be learning in public

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
but it's okay

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,280
it's great advice you know everyone

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,320
makes mistakes

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,880
and i think in in a way uh

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,559
i would personally recommend uh as the

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,240
first contribution

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,440
fix typo is the best thing yeah

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,400
yeah you know that's a

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
known code correction and it's the

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,200
contribution right

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,480
even like just removing this a from this

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:40,080
typo will be a contribution and

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,200
your your github will grab

00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,120
the green color right

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
we all want the green color i have

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
something to say on that subject if you

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,400
don't mind cohey

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,360
that's fine yeah go ahead there's like

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,200
this contra

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,520
there's a can people think that uh

00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,120
documentation contributions to open

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,159
source projects are somehow like

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,919
inherently less

00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,559
valuable than writing code and

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,000
i think that is a terrible and

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,679
destructive and toxic

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,280
mentality documentation contributions

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,400
especially from newbies are

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,000
so valuable because oftentimes the

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,320
people yeah like oftentimes the people

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,840
writing the documentation

00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,000
we are experts okay and

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,760
that sounds great but the reality is

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,520
that being an expert makes it really

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,000
easy to forget what it's like

00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,840
to not know something so the

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
documentation often ends up written from

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,720
the perspective of somebody who is an

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,440
expert

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,760
and yeah that makes it way less

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,840
approachable it means it's so hard

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,600
i i firmly believe that part of the

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,080
reason why some of these tools

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
have a reputation for being hard to

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,320
learn

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
is because they were hard for us to

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:55,120
learn when we built them

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,919
but we haven't adapted the documentation

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,760
and

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,360
so if you are a newbie and you are

00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,120
looking for a way to

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,480
make a non-code contribution back to

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,200
kubernetes

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,799
or you're looking for a way to like

00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,360
figure out the process

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,960
for contributing to kubernetes please

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,960
contribute documentation

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,679
because it really is super super

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,559
valuable i read docs and i love a good

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,320
doc

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,919
i don't try to use the tool until i've

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,039
read the docs

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,640
and because of the nature of my job

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,320
i am frequently a newbie on things

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,480
so newbie centric documentation is super

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,360
valuable and if you are new

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,880
i would love to have you please

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,120
absolutely absolutely

00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,039
i love the irony uh but i'm going to say

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,640
it anyway that being a beginner

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,640
is an expertise it is it definitely is

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,679
and and being somebody who's continually

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,520
learning new things

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,200
i think you bring in expertise of like

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,000
oh i know what other people are going to

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,120
stumble

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,000
upon and if you have the skills to to

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,360
provide that back amazing do that one

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,919
thing i'd say is that like

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,640
get contribution or contributing through

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,320
github

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,720
the whole pull request system is

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,440
something we undervalue the complexity

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,600
of

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,120
and it is a language to learn it is

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,279
painful and

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,039
there's very funny youtube videos of

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,480
people struggling through it

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:20,000
i've made some myself so don't

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,240
don't feel discouraged if you're not

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,440
great at get partner with somebody who's

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
willing to help you

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,799
and that's what we're building in

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,320
upstream marketing subgroup

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,520
is a group of people that if you have a

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,640
great idea of what to write you've

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,559
already written something up and you

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,159
don't know how to get it into the system

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:36,159
we have a bunch of people that will help

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:39,440
you get it into the system because

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,480
you're right those ideas are needed and

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,400
it's okay to suck it get like i think

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,400
everybody sucks at get to some degree

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,960
but not knowing it yet

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,080
is totally okay too oh yeah i

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,679
get like big time

00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:57,840
big time i don't know what i'm doing and

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,840
it's like

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,840
i have to buy that because i i need it i

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:09,360
need it like if if something goes wrong

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:12,240
with a commit or emerge i'm lost

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,760
like i'm going to have to google it i'm

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,400
going to have to google it if i have to

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,159
reset

00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,919
god help me you know it's absolutely i

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:22,720
still have some trouble with

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,200
get rebased too that can be overwhelming

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,960
oh yeah those get messy

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,120
and it's okay to make these mistakes you

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,400
know like we we all do we weren't born

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,600
experts

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,799
yeah yeah yeah you know i but

00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,640
some of us are just more comfortable

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,400
screwing up in public you know

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,159
it is my job just grow up in public to

00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,760
an extent it's caslin's job to screw up

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,559
in public it's matt's job to grow up in

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,120
public

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,679
jobs in public so that you don't feel as

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,960
bad about screwing up in public

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,960
learning in public yeah it's good

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,799
it's fun so i didn't write this one down

00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,919
but uh so it'll definitely be an organic

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,640
conversation

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:01,120
how do you all manage your time when it

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,200
comes to contributing to kubernetes

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,880
because for some of us it's part of our

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,240
day jobs for some of us it's only

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
volunteer base and

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,840
there's going to be a mix of people that

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,240
do that

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,600
how do you set those boundaries in when

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,760
there's just so much to do

00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,279
and so many places you could be

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,840
communicating

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,470
caslin do you want to kick us off i can

00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,559
start

00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:24,640
[Laughter]

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,559
time management is such a challenge for

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,960
me in all aspects

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,240
of managing work there's so much work

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,520
that i want to do and that i have so

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,360
much fun doing

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,960
uh so that's a pretty good problem to

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,320
have of course they're also the things

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,320
that are not as fun so you got to work

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,760
those in there too but

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,000
time management is actually something

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,399
that i enjoy quite a bit

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
like a lot of people i think i hop

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,919
around between different

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:53,120
tools and and methodologies for

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:56,159
managing my time um for

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,440
uh open source contribution

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,120
being on slack is really key to me being

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,919
able to do that

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,440
um because being able to see what people

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,720
are talking about and being involved in

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,039
those conversations

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,279
kind of throughout the day helps me to

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,279
keep in mind what my tasks are

00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:15,039
and then i have a lot of different tools

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,520
that i use to manage those tasks like my

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,640
planner that i have right here

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,240
or my post-it notes all over my desk

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,320
uh and sometimes i use like online tools

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,919
so it's a variety of things but the main

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,000
thing that really keeps me

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,919
excited about the work and keeps me on

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,279
task is talking with other people

00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,840
in the slack cool so you keep it present

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,760
to keep

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,200
uh on task that's a cool strategy

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,679
others want to jump in so some parts of

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,279
uh the way i contribute are time boxed

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,600
and others are not

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,399
the way i contribute back to the

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,679
community

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,880
um socially uh which is like heavily

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,039
through twitter usage

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,360
that's not time boxed i will do that any

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,600
time of the day or night

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,919
if it happens i will respond to it

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:07,360
because it's uh it's low effort for me

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:10,799
and also because i genuinely enjoy it

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,080
other contributions um this this varies

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,320
based on like what what you

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,120
genuinely enjoy like what do you think

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,480
is fun

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:21,120
what makes you happy other other

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,880
things i don't i do time box like really

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,520
really aggressively

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,559
you will not see me making a pull

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:30,799
request

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:33,440
at like 10 a.m on a sunday

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,039
or at 9 30 a.m on a wednesday i don't do

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,320
that i'm very defensive of my

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,399
my personal time which i think is

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,200
actually an important thing you can't

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,720
make

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,399
something like this your whole entire

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
life or you are going to burn out and we

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,440
don't want you to burn out we want you

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,640
to stick around for a long time and help

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,000
us out

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,720
but as for uh like managing what i do

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,279
when

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,399
i agree with caslin the like actively

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,520
talking to people

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,840
aspect is really really important to me

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,520
because i i believe that you do you need

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,720
all of the context you can get

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,120
like i said earlier you can't assume

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
what other people know so there there

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,279
has to be an exchange

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,480
of information so the slack is super

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,720
important

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,159
twitter is super important for me at

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,200
least it might not be for you

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,000
but definitely um you need to be hanging

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,720
out in slack

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and again please don't burn out because

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,120
we love you

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,360
and we want you to stay that's a really

00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,279
important point of view

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:35,679
thank you you're so nice

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,279
no this is the first time the four of us

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,040
have hung out and we're really enjoying

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,520
it and trying to plan trips to japan

00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,679
[Laughter]

00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:48,240
yes we got to get drinks yeah so

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,720
yeah how do you think about this so from

00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,600
my point of view i i i will start

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,480
uh by providing a different context so

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,240
everyone

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,640
i mean if you're interested in

00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,799
contributing to a kubernetes project or

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,320
any like cncf project that means also

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,919
means like it

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,120
if that at some extent you want the

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,919
the badge on your github right you want

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,360
to be a member

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,840
yeah so you know in order to get a

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:18,159
membership of a project you have to keep

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,720
contributing

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,440
at some extent i i cannot i cannot say

00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,519
how long

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,720
because it it's different depending on

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,600
which uh

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,320
organization you want to get involved uh

00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,600
but yeah

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,279
so in order to keep contributing as just

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,559
cat said yeah you should not burn out

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,320
that's something um that you have to

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:43,279
manage by yourself

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,399
so like uh time management is such an

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,519
important factor

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:51,360
to do that because um

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:54,880
personally i both uh

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,159
like i i basically contribute uh

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:01,200
for my work and not for my work because

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,840
i didn't introduce myself uh uh

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,640
as in where i belong to uh but i i

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,399
belong to

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,679
a hewlett packard enterprise as a

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,919
solution architect

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,200
so i sometimes contribute to open source

00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,240
project uh

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,679
because my clients are having issues

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:21,919
right so that case it's part of work

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,039
but i also enjoy uh tech stuff by myself

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,960
so like especially like uh improving uh

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,720
documentation such as like

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,320
you know this getting started doesn't

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,360
work so i fix it

00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,640
right those things um that that's part

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,399
of my hobby

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:41,279
so you're so cool thank you

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:42,080
i'm trying to be yeah so so basically

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,840
those things

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,679
uh i i it i think it's different from

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,120
uh cat uh because it's it's also part

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,320
of my personal time right so

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,720
um i do that on wednesday like uh in the

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,960
very early morning or it could be really

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,480
like middle of the night or it could be

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,480
weekends weekdays

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,000
uh but it's just you know my personal

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,039
preference so you don't

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,440
have to push yourself to do that

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,080
you can just do it whenever you want

00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,519
right

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:15,120
yeah if it's something you enjoy that's

00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,840
why like the social media thing for me

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,360
is like if you

00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,799
ask me a kubernetes question on twitter

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,440
i'll just answer it because i enjoy it

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,760
yeah yeah yeah

00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,240
and for some people will be exhausted by

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,679
that yeah yeah

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,159
so like my my best way to manage the

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,720
time

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,279
is not to manage the time just do it

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,840
when you want to do it

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,799
well so that sounds ironic but i i think

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,320
uh it's the

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,440
uh i for myself uh it makes the best

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,559
uh you know

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,919
efficient yeah yeah it takes time to

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,559
manage a to-do list so

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,480
like if you if you can trust your

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,880
intuition on and just

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,159
play like use kubernetes community as a

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,919
playground i think

00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:00,320
that's a beautiful way to use it and be

00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,200
part of it yeah i use it as a toy

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,080
yeah and that's cool we appreciate it um

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,360
and you know i

00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,679
i wanted to ask this question because i

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,520
find it so complex for people and it's

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,760
the most common thing i hear

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,200
is like how do i contribute where when

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,240
do i contribute

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,320
and for me like i found that

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:19,440
so my job is not directly to contribute

00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,919
to kubernetes

00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,720
but i'm not a huge vendor that gets a

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:25,839
lot of value

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:29,119
from people like me being in this type

00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:31,679
of community so i found like

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,159
most many people i can't say most many

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,639
people

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,560
have enough flexibility in their week

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,280
where they can carve a few hours

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,760
and choose what to do with it and for me

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,919
that is

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,800
kubernetes contribution it is a few

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,639
hours a week

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,320
it's no more than four during the work

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,000
day occasionally sometimes out of the

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,760
work day just to banter

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,079
with people and work on projects that i

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,159
like much like cohei

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,240
but because of that i've been able to

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,680
like slowly integrate it more into my

00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,680
day job because

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,280
you know lo and behold when results show

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,000
up people are excited about what i'm

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,240
doing

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,480
so at first it was just for me but i

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,599
pitched it well enough that it's now for

00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:12,079
us as well and i think if you're

00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,680
at kubecon and you're listening to this

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,880
you might be in a similar position where

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,880
you could maybe

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,880
grow your role that way if it interests

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,240
you but it will take that first

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,960
like initiative of just carving off time

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,119
and asking for forgiveness instead of

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,040
permission and just doing good work and

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,119
being a community member

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,359
getting that little badge and then you

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,359
know celebrating that afterwards

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,400
so very cool it's cool to hear how all

00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,400
of you do it and i

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,560
definitely love the social media aspect

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,520
too i'm

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:44,320
way too active on twitter or maybe just

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,880
active enough

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,520
yeah just active enough just active all

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,040
right i'll

00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,599
we're we're just about to run out of

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,560
time um let's do a quick

00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,440
wrap up anything that uh let's just do

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,400
around the horn

00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,839
say like one thing you're thankful for

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,599
or no

00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,320
what do you want to do final advice i

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:05,680
guess

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
there we go that's a much better

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,320
conclusion final final

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:16,079
tl dr too long didn't read advice

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,760
i'll start you have valuable

00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,920
contributions everybody

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,920
like listening to this watching this you

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,320
have something to contribute that we

00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,119
find

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,480
valuable you might think to yourself oh

00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,040
you know i don't know i don't know

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,720
anything i don't know what i'm doing

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,280
that's still valuable the fact that you

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,880
don't know what you're doing and we do

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,200
like we we need that perspective too

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:47,920
so you're all valuable in some way

00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,920
so if you want give it to us

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:59,040
kohei please fix our typos

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,160
and also if you ever speak any other

00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:03,599
language

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,320
than english it's another way to

00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,119
contribute

00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,880
too so localization project has a lot of

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,000
languages such as spanish

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,640
korean and also japanese by being myself

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,160
uh yeah that's where you can contribute

00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,960
as well because you can actually

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,880
communicate

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,160
with the con other contributors in your

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,599
language

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,000
which is uh you know advanced advantage

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,040
it's it's huge yeah that's such a great

00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,280
one

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,280
yeah so please fix typos yeah

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,200
and my final word of advice would be

00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,960
don't give up

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,640
there were a couple of times when i

00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:40,079
tried to get involved with the community

00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,320
when it just didn't work out

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,320
it wasn't the right timing and that's

00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,400
okay i still wanted to be involved and i

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,320
still eventually got involved

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,240
so if you're struggling to get involved

00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,640
