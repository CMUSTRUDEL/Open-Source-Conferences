Kubernetes’ significance doesn’t suffer from attempts at description, e.g.: the de facto next, a lingua franca, THE ubiquitous cloud OS, et cetera. We believe it’s all that and more, but while it’s here and immensely capable, it alas can still be hard, inconsistent, & incomplete. Choice paralysis, trepidation at the prospect of vendor lock-in, and concern about availability of the skillsets required remain challenges for many. And how do you equip it to provide the right set of services and qualities for all manner of applications, both those originally cloud-native and those that started elsewhere and have evolved? So, it’s 2021 and we’ve learned a few things along the way. Let’s talk about how to navigate and operate to wield the true power of Kubernetes whether you’re a virtuoso or perhaps one of the rest of us.

welcome to cubecon emilia 2021 and my

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:05,600
lightning talk

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,560
i'm rob esker from netapp i'd like to

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
offer

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,679
to the extent that i can within five

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,800
minutes a few of our observations from

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,000
netapp in our

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,000
our years of having worked with

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,440
deployers and of course as practitioners

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,520
ourselves

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
a few things primarily from the lens of

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,760
storage and data management that

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,199
hopefully can inform how you look at and

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,480
approach and operate kubernetes

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,640
let me just start with a little bit

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,160
about netapp i mentioned or alluded to

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,039
you know we worked with many thousands

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,840
of customers

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,960
since the inception we contribute to the

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,559
storage sigs

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,160
uh data protection working group and of

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,440
course the continued storage

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,719
uh interface specification as well um

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
you know our customers brought us to the

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,280
conversation we use kubernetes ourselves

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,680
to power many of our cloud services

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,120
more to talk about on that uh in

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,120
actually the coming months

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,559
uh so this is not just a scenario we're

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,239
providing capabilities vis-a-vis

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,879
kubernetes but also building our own

00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:01,840
products based in part on kubernetes

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,000
um so a little bit about um i guess on

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,040
the editorial and about kubernetes i'd

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,680
offer

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,080
um that we have seen from our customers

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
uh kind of a realization or epiphany

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,240
process of epiphany where there's

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,560
there's an understanding that kubernetes

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,799
is maybe not necessarily strictly just

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,119
an

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,200
evolution of more hypervisor vm based

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:24,560
uh classic infrastructure as a service

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
that indeed it's a

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
predominantly a desired state machine uh

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,439
particularly useful

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,400
for you know automating scaling and you

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,680
know life cycle

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,560
of applications mostly

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
thought to be predicated on containers

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
but actually not entirely confined to

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,320
that when you look at things like

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
verb that said it's it's an important

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,840
sort of calibration at the outset

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
that there are some things that are a

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,159
little bit different about kubernetes

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,960
than

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,960
than what you might have expected from a

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,240
vm and a surrounding ecosystem

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,119
as a runtime so just to start with that

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,719
uh one of the things uh in particular if

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,079
you add kind of a time dimension to

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,240
understanding kubernetes is at the

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,479
beginning it was really built of

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,920
can i take a quote-unquote cloud-native

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,239
application built of a

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,360
12-factor application model which maybe

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,200
didn't necessarily

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,720
uh you know really kind of thought that

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,360
the only way to persist

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,200
data was in an object and and can i

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
deliver it of course it did that well

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,720
but that was a bit limiting in terms of

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
the style and kind

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,640
of computational problem for which

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,800
kubernetes could be applied

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
so uh it was certainly the case that

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,480
from the outset

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
we seek to engage to help in the

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,640
community context

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,000
evolve a more sophisticated construct a

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,040
la csi

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,440
for accessing uh distinguishing

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,959
qualities of storage not strictly

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,720
it's an object here but like i have

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,560
something that i have multiple access

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,400
modes to interact with perhaps

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,640
mini writers against a common a common

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,319
byte range there's different access

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,360
modes that have evolved in kubernetes

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,159
for accessing

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,720
data sets there are there's a notion of

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,680
storage

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,800
classes for which you can define uh

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,800
distinguishing

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
capabilities that one application may

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
demand versus another

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,920
and from a netapp perspective we have

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,760
provided

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,080
those capabilities in all of the public

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,159
cloud most recognizable public clouds

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,080
in a variety of different services we've

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,319
wedded them to kubernetes

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,440
uh with a project called trident and we

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,840
built that into

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,840
a new capability called astra which

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,280
takes sort of an application-centric

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,640
perspective

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
of delivering

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,159
sophisticated persistence that's

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,080
portable in the same way that a work

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,440
an actual application itself may be

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,360
portable um

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,120
for kubernetes from one place to another

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,319
whether it's across the public clouds or

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,720
on-prem you know a few things i'd also

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,360
offer

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,200
just kind of rapid fire style uh in

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,560
terms of of things we've seen

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,200
do not perceive that default security

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,159
you know

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,439
intelligent defaults are necessarily

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,200
always accounted for

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,480
vertically across the entirety of the

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,720
stack you know

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,400
secrets are they in fact secret actually

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
no

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
they're not the case i encourage you to

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,599
look at kubernetes documentation

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,599
uh actually by default everything's

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,840
stored as an unencrypted string

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,959
they can be re-retrieved as plain text

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,919
by anyone with

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,560
with you know the necessary api access

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,800
um

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
think about the underpinning persistent

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,479
volumes

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,280
and who has access to it and from what

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,360
layer

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,960
so security is not necessarily a simple

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,400
topic i have heard

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,759
in the most recent cloud native

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,240
computing foundation governing board

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,400
meeting

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,919
it's only six percent of the folks who

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,080
have attempted the cks

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,199
examination so far have passed it now

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,720
that's early data

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,199
that could change the point is it's not

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,280
a it's not a simple topic

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,880
i do want to make a quick plug there's a

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,440
ton of topics we'd love to engage with

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,040
you on

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,639
at netapp's virtual booth here at

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
kubecon and

00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,280
uh thank you for the opportunity and

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
