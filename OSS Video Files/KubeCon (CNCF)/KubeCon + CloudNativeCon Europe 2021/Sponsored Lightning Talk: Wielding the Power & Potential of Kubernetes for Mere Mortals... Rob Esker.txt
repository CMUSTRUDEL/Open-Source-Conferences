Sharing of Personal Information with Sponsors In order to facilitate networking and business relationships at the event, you may choose to visit a third partyʼs virtual booth or to access sponsored content. You are never required to visit third party booths or to access sponsored content. When visiting a booth (e.g. by clicking on a third partyʼs logo in the Solutions Showcase or exhibitor directory, and any actions within the booth thereafter including viewing resources), when accessing sponsored sessions in the Sponsor Theater, or by participating in sponsored activities, the third party will receive some of your registration data. This data includes your first name, last name, title, company, address, email, standard demographics questions (i.e. job function, industry), and details about the sponsored content or resources you interacted with. If you choose to interact with a virtual booth or access sponsored content, you are explicitly consenting to receipt and use of such data by the third-party recipients, which will be subject to their own privacy policies.

Kubernetes’ significance doesn’t suffer from attempts at description, e.g.: the de facto next, a lingua franca, THE ubiquitous cloud OS, et cetera. We believe it’s all that and more, but while it’s here and immensely capable, it alas can still be hard, inconsistent, & incomplete. Choice paralysis, trepidation at the prospect of vendor lock-in, and concern about availability of the skillsets required remain challenges for many. And how do you equip it to provide the right set of services and qualities for all manner of applications, both those originally cloud-native and those that started elsewhere and have evolved? So, it’s 2021 and we’ve learned a few things along the way. Let’s talk about how to navigate and operate to wield the true power of Kubernetes whether you’re a virtuoso or perhaps one of the rest of us.
