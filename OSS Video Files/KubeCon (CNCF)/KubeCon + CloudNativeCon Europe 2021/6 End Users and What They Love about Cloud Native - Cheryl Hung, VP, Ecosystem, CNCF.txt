[Music]

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,800
up

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,000
i'm cheryl hung and it is magical to be

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,480
back for my 11th coupon cloud native con

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,240
what excites me and keeps me coming back

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,599
is seeing people discover cloud native

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,519
for the first time

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,000
grow their careers and transform into

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,920
community and industry leaders

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
who then bring on the next generation of

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
cloud natives

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
going virtual has expanded kubecon to

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,719
people who could never have dreamed of

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,879
attending previously

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,160
so whether this is your first coupon or

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,160
your veteran

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,480
you're welcome you're part of this

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,800
community and i want you to grow and to

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
help others grow

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,840
along with virtual events covid has

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:58,800
accelerated everything cloud native

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,399
over 80 projects now called cncf home

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,000
and there's almost a thousand cloud

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:05,600
native tools and frameworks

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,159
on the cncf landscape organizations are

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,200
pushing the possibilities of where and

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,840
how to deploy containers and kubernetes

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,119
but to fully embrace cloud native you're

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,840
going to have to understand what's

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,040
possible

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
and what are the challenges you're going

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,159
to face along the way

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,000
i lead to the cncf end user community

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
it's the largest end user community of

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,880
any open source foundation or standards

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,560
body

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,479
with over 140 members so i have a pretty

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,840
unique view into how engineers solve

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,960
thousands of problems

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,439
across hundreds of different

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,360
environments today

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,200
i'm going to reveal these insights from

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,759
the cncf end user community

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,000
to you so you're equipped for your cloud

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,240
native journey

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,079
each year the cncf end user community

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,200
votes to award one member

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,240
the cncf top end user award

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,920
previous winners included zolando intuit

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,439
bloomberg jd.com and didi this year i'm

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,280
not only announcing the winner

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,880
but i've invited all of the nominees to

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,520
share their cloud native journey with

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,800
you

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,039
and what the community means to them

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
but before we find out the winner i want

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,959
to have a little bit of fun

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,720
kubecon style i'm going to challenge you

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,440
to solve a small problem

00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,480
in the style of the cks or certified

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,720
kubernetes security specialist exam

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,640
at the end i'll reveal the solution and

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,239
that solution will reveal the winner of

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,280
the cncf top end user

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,440
2021 so i'm going to go over to the

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,480
laptop

00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,760
if you've taken the cka ckd or cks

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
certifications

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,120
this is going to look really familiar so

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,440
i'm in the linux foundation exam portal

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,120
on the left hand side i have the task

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,640
that we're going to do today

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,920
and on the right hand side i have a

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,000
terminal which links to a live cluster

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,840
first off let's just take a quick look

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,920
at the cluster itself

00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,519
which i'm going to do with a quick get

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,519
nodes

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,959
this looks like a really tiny cluster

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,920
just a master and a single worker

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,760
and then our task is in three parts so

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,680
the first task is to retrieve the

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,879
content of the existing secret named

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
credentials

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,080
in the demo namespace and i'm going to

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,040
do that just

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,959
to look at that cool okay i've seen that

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,319
we have a credentials secret

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,720
and credentials encodes the name of the

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,720
winner of the top end user award

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,159
so when we find out the solution to this

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,920
we'll also find out the winner of the

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,080
award itself

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,159
our second part is to store the winner

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,440
field and the password field

00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:44,720
into these two files creating them as we

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,280
go along

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
and then the third part is to use secret

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,120
and

00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,439
decrypt one from the other

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,040
i'm gonna pause there and i'm gonna ask

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,640
you what would you do

00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,560
in this situation so head over to slack

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,560
discuss it with other people and we'll

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,560
find out the solution at the end

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,319
okay time to bring on our nominees to

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,440
with the introduction of the macintosh

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,360

products on earth and to leaving the

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,520
world better than we found it

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,800
cern is the world's largest particle

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,720
physics laboratory

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
it was founded in 1954 with the main

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
goal being fundamental research we try

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
to understand the building blocks of the

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,960
universe and for that we build

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,280
very large scientific experiments like

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,680
the large hadron collider

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,160
fidelity investment is 75 years old a

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,639
privately owned financial institution

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,199
we invested billions of dollars annually

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,120
in game changing technology platforms

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,120
between big data ais cloud computings

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,039
very forward thinking ideas that

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,240
happening inside our fatality technology

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,080
teams spotify launched in 2008 and today

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,120
we are the world's most popular

to enjoy and be inspired by it

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,240
hi i'm mooji gohar from verizon media as

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,080
well as a media group our brands like

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,240
yahoo techcrunch riot

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,280
and many more help people stay informed

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
and entertained

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,680
communicate and transact while creating

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,680
new ways for our advertisers

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,520
and partners to connect with with

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,440
technologies like xr ai

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,280
machine learning and 5g we are

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:02,080
transforming media for tomorrow too

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,560
all right first off tell me why and how

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,479
you're using cloud native

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,039
one-on-one melee media's cloud native

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,520
journey started in 2017

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,160
with our first small kubernetes cluster

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,560
since then

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,479
the environment has grown to 16 clusters

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
running on nearly 1 000 bare metal

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,800
servers

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,080
this sums up to 55 000 usable cpu cores

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,680
and 280 terabytes of ram

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,680
the clusters are managed and operated

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,599
centrally by a dedicated and highly

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,360
skilled team of specialists

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,759
access to the kubernetes clusters is

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
provided by a multi-tenancy setup

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,120
this provides easy but still isolated

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,360
on-demand provisioning

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,680
dynamic auto scaling and efficient usage

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,759
of available resources

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,680
the tight integration with our ci cd

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,800
system makes kubernetes an attractive

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,039
default platform

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,039
for running our applications this

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:53,280
relieves the application devops teams

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,879
from tedious and repetitive tasks so

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,280
they can fully focus on providing

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,360
business value instead

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,560
the core elements of our platform are

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,759
cncf projects

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,080
like kubernetes lcd container d

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
prometheus and open policy agent core

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,080
dns helm

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,960
and fluentd and from the surrounding

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,160
ecosystem

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,960
we happily use traffic istio flatcar

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,319
linux

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,479
calico gitlab and grafana apple was

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,800
using mesos but decided to transition to

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,280
kubernetes for scalability reasons

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,960
our users are java python and go

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,560
developers who want to test and run

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,720
their applications in containers

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
and are interested in kubernetes as part

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,399
of their cicd pipeline

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:40,000
we use a large number of cncf products

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,760
kubernetes container d envoy

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,360
prometheus cubevert xcd

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,640
cryo oppa core dns

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,640
jager falco and helm

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,560
our users want to adopt cloud native

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,120
tools for better debugging

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
logging monitoring and tracing of our

00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,920
applications

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,080
one of our main challenges is to make

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,000
sure that we can keep up with the needs

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,320
of our physicists as they produce

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
larger and larger experiments this means

00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
that we are always searching for

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
new technologies and kubernetes and the

00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
cloud native ecosystem

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,399
and projects like kubernetes but also

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,120
prometheus

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
core dns fluency container d and many

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,680
others

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
have made a huge impact by simplifying

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,560
our infrastructure

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
and letting us focus on on the physics

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,600
analysis itself

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,680
cncf is allowing us

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,959
to collaborate and to help building this

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
unique solution

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,200
indeed shape the strategy for fidelity

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,279
and for multi-cloud strategy

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
for all of our application workloads

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,000
between using corporaties between the

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,720
innovation

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,519
ideas around envoy and service mesh

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,519
between

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,200
the open telemetry solutions that being

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,360
provided by cncf

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,399
it did shape our strategy to pull the

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,320
foundation

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
for the next generation of the financial

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,320
service platform

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,600
built inside for that on kubernetes we

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,640
are operating on 150 clusters

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,600
running over 2800 services

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,800
across all stages of our software life

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
cycle

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,440
we have multi-tenant clusters running

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,640
many different types of workloads

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,279
including ml jobs media transcoding

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,079
data pipeline orchestration and high

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,399
scale back-end services

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,680
using kubernetes has significantly

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,800
reduced our cost

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,600
and increase our overall velocity we

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,320
also use

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,000
a number of other cncf projects such as

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
premiums for monitoring

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
and algorithms for automated canary

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,079
analysis

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,160
and branch deployments with the growing

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,399
portfolio of media brands right we

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,680
had n number of stack managed by a

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,760
number of team

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,959
each team doing their own tools and

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,360
platforms and

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,399
none of them were containerized

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
additionally

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
we had our own in-house on-prem

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
homegrown solution

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,519
of pushing and deploying code it was

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,880
very very painful

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,600
and took a long time when we decided to

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,040
move towards

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,839
immutable infrastructure and

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,120
condensation we evaluated number of

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,519
orchestration solutions

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,920
and we picked kubernetes it was

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,560
outstanding for its futures

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,240
today we have one of the largest

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,519
kubernetes on-prem cluster

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,880
with over 2500 plus applications 34 plus

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,120
production clusters

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,680
running in seven data centers and 8 000

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,680
plus no cluster

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,279
by moving service into containers and

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
using kubernetes as an orchestration

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,320
platform

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,240
helped us to reduce duplication

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,440
standardize the way we build

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,800
and deploy code today and also increased

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,519
our custom utilization

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:44,000
and to add increase our product velocity

00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,279
and developer productivity

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,440
next what does the community mean to you

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,839
melon media joined the cncf in the

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,040
beginning of 2020 as an end user

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,320
supporter

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,720
since then we are regularly

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
participating at the bi-weekly community

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
meetings

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,120
usually with at least two people in this

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,279
meeting series

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,120
we already had multiple opportunities to

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,240
share our experience and knowledge in

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,320
short presentations

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,760
and of course we regularly engage in the

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,920
discussions

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,440
additionally we host local meetups and

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
also speak at conferences

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,920
like devop con container dates in

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,320
hamburg and of course also at cubecon

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,440
where we could enter the stage in 2019

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,560
in barcelona

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,399
and at least virtually last year on the

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,240
more technical side we also involve

00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,560
ourselves in many products we use

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,279
at least by reporting issues we find or

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,680
adding more data to existing bug reports

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,240
occasionally we can also contribute by

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,360
fixing smaller bugs ourselves apple

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
joined the cncf in 2019 as an end user

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,720
supporter

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
we actively participate as speakers and

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,040
attendees at community events

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,120
like kubecon and even shared our story

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
in a keynote at cubecon north america

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,880
last year

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,399
apple employees serve on committees and

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,519
boards throughout the project

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,079
including the cncf governing board toc

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,000
steering committee and release team we

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,839
regularly participate in sigs

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
and employ a number of maintainers and

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,399
core contributors

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:12,639
to cncf projects apple employees

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,920
such as paris pittman and myself have

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
received the chopped wood

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,760
and carry water awards for our

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,920
contributions to the community

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,160
so thank you very much cncf it's been a

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,760
very very exciting journey until now

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,839
working with everyone with all the

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,600
projects and the rest of the community

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,200
and we are really really looking forward

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,760
to what's coming next and to continue

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,920
working together with everyone

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,560
in the past year we contributed two

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,120
projects to the open source community

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,920
kiran and k connect we truly believe

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,399
that all sources

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,160
is going to help the communities both

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,800
and will help them security and the

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,440
governor's side of the house

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,959
i believe that with that focus and with

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,839
that support and with that cost

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,399
promotion

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,160
between cncf and fidelity we are

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,760
sponsoring many block groups at this

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,000
moment and workshops

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,680
and we're helping our colleagues in

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,680
other financial services

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,760
and another service as a matter of fact

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,680
to help the cncf strategy

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,800
next year and to help with the roadmap

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,760
around companies

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,600
and about other projects that cncf has i

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,360
truly believe it's small space and it

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,720
will help fidelity as it will help the

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
community as well

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,639
our flagship contribution in 2020 was

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,480
backstage

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
which is our open source developer

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,839
portal and the response from the

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,279
community has been nothing short of

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,240
extraordinary

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,920
in terms of adoption we have 24 official

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,279
company adopters

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,680
79 companies are building a portal

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,040
209 companies are interested in learning

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,839
more and these numbers

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:46,000
are growing rapidly we have

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,839
302 git clones per week

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,079
and 313 external contributors

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
and the project is adding six new

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,920
contributors

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,240
every week we've been contributing to

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
almost all of the cnc projects that we

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,760
use

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,760
whether it's documentation issues code

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,440
or speaking about them at various

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,279
conferences and meetups

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,120
most notably we've been actively

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,040
contributing code to envoy

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,320
where one of our engineers is a core

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,959
contributor

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,199
we've also done extensive work with grpc

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,199
in kubernetes where we've helped resolve

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,680
numerous issues that we face during

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,040
adoption with the community at large

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,199
beyond coding projects we've also been

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,880
very active we have spotify employees

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,920
wearing many different hats across the

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,839
ncs

00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,440
including one of the co-chairs of the

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,560
developer experience sig in the end user

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,040
community

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,240
and one of the end user representatives

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,040
on the cncf

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,600
toc but it's not just hats that we wear

00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,720
for cncf we wear lots of other swag too

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,000
including ambassador crowns program

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,680
committee pins

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
and of course the endless amount of

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,959
great t-shirts for different roles that

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:54,160
we have for cncf

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,839
we've also given many talks at kubecon

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,560
including multiple keynotes and as many

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,920
as six talks in san diego

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,600
and we've done lots and lots of

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,720
different podcasts representing cncf

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,800
technologies

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,440
there are many reasons we love being

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,759
part of a cncf end user community

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,600
as a company giving back to the open

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,800
source community herself has been very

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,720
important to us

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,560
we have made upstream kubernetes

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
contribution in the form of issues and

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,320
pull requests

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,560
specifically for on y and oppa we also

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,519
open source several kubernetes

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,040
focus projects we also built and open

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,199
sourced a certificate based

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,680
authentication and authorization system

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,279
athens to implement zero test security

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,680
principle in the platform

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,079
we are very excited that athens is now

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,440
part of the cncf sandbox project and we

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,519
are looking forward to build a great

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,199
community

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,360
it's actually incredible to see how

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,480
cloud native has transformed these

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,320
organizations

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,160
and what these teams have achieved so

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,079
huge thank you to you for sharing your

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,160
stories

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,120
let's go back to the laptop now find out

00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,800
the solution

00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,000
and the winner for the top end user

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,000
award 2021

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:04,160
okay so we were at the point of storing

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,839
the winner and the password field into

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,480
these two files

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,520
so let's take a closer look at that

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,520
credential secret

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,079
and yeah looks like there is a password

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,600
and a winner field

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,839
here so i'm gonna take this

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,240
and just echo it into these two files

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,039
that was told to so i just got the

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:33,840
winner one

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,840
and i will do the same for password now

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,520
and then our third step was to use

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,919
secrets

00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,000
to decrypt the winner field and they've

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,280
just given the entire command here so

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,280
what happens if i try this

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,840
okay looks like we screwed up somewhere

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,600
because the key doesn't match

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,600
but the key doesn't match because we

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,720
forgot that kubernetes secrets are

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,919
base64 encoded already by default

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,679
which means that there are actually two

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,960
layers of encryption to deal with here

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,720
we have to decrypt

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,960
the base64 and then we also have to

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,600
decrypt with a password

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,720
but we can fix this so let's go back to

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,520
where we

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,039
put the winner field into the c into

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,840
winner.txt

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,320
and we're going to just decrypt it

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,480
before it goes in

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,559
okay now let's try decrypting using

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,000
secret

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:29,520
and that's looking pretty good so

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,960
we should be able to find out the name

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
of our winner

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:40,720
and it's spotify so congratulations to

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
spotify congratulations to you two if

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,280
you are following along

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,440
and if you got the solution

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,559
spotify have been an amazing member of

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,880
our community

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,400
they've contributed so much through the

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,360
projects through donating their own

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
project

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,640
through the toc and the different

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,400
community groups and

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,160
i'd really like to thank them and

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
welcome them back on again to say a few

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,640
words

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,520
wow i can't believe we won thank you so

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,799
much

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,640
thanks to all the end user companies

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,559
that voted for us and thanks to all the

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,160
companies that submitted nominations

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,160
we were truly humbled and really

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,600
inspired to read the other nominations

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,520
and still really can't believe that we

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,200
went out over them

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,640
thanks again to everyone at cncf and

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,960
everyone in this community

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,640
at spotify we're going to build on this

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,520
and try to do even more with this

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,039
community

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,840
in the next year thanks again everyone

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:34,000
congratulations to spotify once again

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,799
your ward is on its way

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,679
and to sum up cloud native is still

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,679
accelerating

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,880
deployments are getting bigger and more

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:43,039
complex

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,039
but with the help of the community you

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,720
too can take charge of your own cloud

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,799
native journey

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,240
if you want even more insights go to

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,080
cncf dot io

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,000
end user and find out why your

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,840
organization should join the cncf end

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,080
user community

00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:59,360
this is show or hung and i can't wait

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:06,159
