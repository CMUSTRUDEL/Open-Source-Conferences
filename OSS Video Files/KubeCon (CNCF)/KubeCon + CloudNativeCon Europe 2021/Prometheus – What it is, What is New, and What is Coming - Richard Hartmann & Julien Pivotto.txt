Prometheus – What it is, What is New, and What is Coming - Richard Hartmann, Grafana Labs & Julien Pivotto, Inuits

Prometheus is a metrics-based monitoring and alerting system and also the project with the second longest tenure within the CNCF. As such you have probably heard about it by now. We will give you a short introduction to Prometheus, what it is and why it was such a big deal when it was initially released. In all those years since then, the project has only gained speed, which provides us with the opportunity to tell you about all the exciting new features that have just been released or are in the pipeline, including opportunities to contribute to the project and its wider ecosystem.
