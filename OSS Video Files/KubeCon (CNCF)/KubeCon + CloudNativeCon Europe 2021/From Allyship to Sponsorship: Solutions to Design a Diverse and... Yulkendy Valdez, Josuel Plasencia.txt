From Allyship to Sponsorship: Solutions to Design a Diverse and Inclusive Community, Sponsored by Red Hat - Yulkendy Valdez, Josuel Plasencia

From Allyship to Sponsorship: Solutions to Design a Diverse and Inclusive Community. This session will engage the audience in creating a more diverse and inclusive open-source community. Research undoubtedly shows that investing in diversity and inclusion helps you develop better technology and increases your bottom line. The challenge is how do we get there; and how do we, as individuals, develop the leadership skills required to be part of the solution.

welcome to our session from

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,080
allyship to sponsorship solutions to

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,880
design

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,880
a diverse and inclusive community i'm

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,120
sure you heard these terms before

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,000
but today it's all about putting them to

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,560
practice

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,240
my name is hurricane divaldes and i'm

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,560
joshua

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,560
we run a company called forefront in our

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,359
day-to-day we work with leaders such as

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
yourself

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:27,119
to help you build diverse and inclusive

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,599
communities

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,400
but we're super super excited about this

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,120
section

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,840
because allyship and sponsorship are the

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,520
most

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,840
powerful tools against bias so the work

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,200
starts today and we put together an

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,640
ambitious agenda

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,520
to get you through the definitions into

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
through some frameworks toolkits you can

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,600
start using

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,480
right after you finish watching this

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,680
recording

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,960
so let's get to work what is

00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,600
allyship what is sponsorship allyship

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,120
is the process of building relationships

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,840
based on trust

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,799
consistency and accountability with

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
marginalized

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,600
individuals and or groups of people

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,840
so let's let's talk scholarship so often

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,479
when you think of an ally you might

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,799
think of this as scenario

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,159
saturday night you're on a train and

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,759
you're about to

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,040
catch a criminal still someone's wallet

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:31,200
and so you're like criminal criminal and

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,560
the criminal gets caught because of your

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,680
bravery

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,200
are you an ally actually that's just

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,759
being a witness you're there you notice

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,040
a bad event happening and you said

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,799
something about it

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,280
basic duty as a human being an ally is

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,720
much

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,280
more than that it's about the proactive

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,159
building of relationships you're

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,439
actively

00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,640
having to really work on getting to know

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,920
people outside your circle actively

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,280
listening and being there for them that

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,160
takes work and we'll show you how to get

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,239
started

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,440
but secondly let's talk about

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,720
sponsorship

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,520
well sponsorship is the ultimate game

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
changer

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
as a regards being an ally it's the

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,800
ultimate form

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,560
because it directly impacts someone's

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
house's career

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,280
and sponsor actively nominates

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,560
people for opportunities promotion

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,840
races you name it so if you

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,920
want to do allyship at the highest level

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
you need to become a sponsor and we'll

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,200
also get to talk about that during this

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,599
session

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,239
but let's dig deeper a little more i

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,400
said

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
being an ally takes work well it's

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,879
because you're

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,000
using all your senses as an ally so this

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,519
is a way

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,959
to visually think about it so from using

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,200
your mouth your words to speak

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
against injustices so if you're in a

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,840
meeting

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,879
and someone says a microaggression

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,200
uh to someone else in the room you can

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,319
say

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
hey that that wasn't nice here's the

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,280
research

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,680
and maybe you should read this article

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,760
or do this if we want to create a more

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,400
inclusive environment for our team so

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,519
that's

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
verbally you talking about it and

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,000
exercising

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,000
our ship but an ally also digs deeper

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,159
you're like an inspector you're sniffing

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,680
around anytime you notice

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,720
biases or any gaps in the system you're

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,680
asking yourself

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,440
why and continuously reflecting even if

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,080
the answers to the questions you're

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
asking

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,760
hurt you hold yourself accountable

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,799
because that's what an

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,239
ally does and similarly you're using

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,879
your eyes

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
to make sure you're not putting on

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,720
blinders

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,560
you're actually noticing when there's

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,360
discrimination happening

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,640
when certain people are not in the room

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
that should be

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,640
and you're actively listening to those

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,799
experiences

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,080
that dove that often don't get the

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
center stage

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,079
you have those conversations and want to

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,000
know the experience about

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,320
women in technology or other

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,440
marginalized communities

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,720
similarly you're always leading with

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,840
your heart right your empathy

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,639
and being a leader that

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,280
actively looks for opportunities to

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
support

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,280
other people you know as an ally you

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,479
might be out there

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,400
protesting marching or justice where you

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,600
might simply be

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,440
advocating for a new policy at work

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,639
that allows people to to thrive

00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,280
so an ally is really using all the re

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,320
all the resources to support other

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,039
people

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,759
and a sponsor again which is the

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,160
ultimate

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,960
form of islandship it's going beyond

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,280
supporting people generally and putting

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,720
pen

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,800
to paper you're inviting someone to an

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,000
exclusive event that's going to help

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,120
their career

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,440
you're nominating them for an award

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,600
you're helping them get a promotion

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
you're helping them get a salary

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,639
increase

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,039
a sponsor is a great

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,199
advocate and champion for someone's

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,759
career and that's ultimately

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,919
where you want to be right allyships are

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
good yes we need a better society and

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,960
better world

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,560
but at the end of the day how are we

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,680
helping that individual

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,960
get to that next stage and

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,479
you know i'm sure we feel

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,400
like we've done these things before

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,520
you're like i got this you know

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,800
i i'm i'm i'm a good person i've done

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,840
that for people

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,199
but are we doing that actively data

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:06,160
is showing that we're not in particular

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,440
more than 80 percent of white employees

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,880
see themselves

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,360
as allies yet if you ask

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,400
women if you ask women of color in

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,360
particular

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
just 45 percent of them say they have

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
strong allies

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,560
and with latinas in particular 55

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
say they have allies so there's a huge

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,600
gap

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
and you see the same thing happening

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,560
with sponsors

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,160
13 of black women have sponsors that is

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,880
a minimal number

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
the reason is is that sponsors usually

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,800
have

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,199
this mini me complex right

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,280
i want to see a meeting me i want to be

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,240
able to support someone that looks like

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
me

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
because it reminds me of of me my

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,520
background where i

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,120
started but the reality is if

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,160
the diversity of leadership leadership

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,639
is not there

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,360
who's going to help those other mini

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
needs

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
people of color and marginalized

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,479
communities so as sponsors

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,960
we actively have to try to support

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,919
people that are different from us not

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,599
just that are

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,759
the same and for us you know

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:20,080
we love the work that we do because we

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,080
lived it we've been in the other side

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,639
we needed those sponsors and those

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,039
allies as young professionals of color

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,759
josue can you share more about what that

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,479
experience was like for you

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,319
yes thank you and while the data is

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:37,520
important the personal stories

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,160
bring them to life on my end here i am

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,400
being

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,000
thrown in the air as a one-year-old by

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,759
my father

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
but what you may not know when you see

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,720
josue now

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,120
is that i was raised by a single mother

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,360
and my father was incarcerated and

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
deported from the united states when i

00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,080
was just a few years old

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:01,919
limiting that photo to just a memory

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:04,479
and that's just one aspect of my

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:08,319
identity i'm also a low-income

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,879
first generation and a person of color

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,520
growing up i didn't know what the word

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,960
ally

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,000
or sponsorship was but many times i

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,960
needed one i could have used one

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
and it was through allies and sponsors

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,919
as i got older

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,759
that i even have the opportunity to

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,720
speak to you all today

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,560
thank you for sharing that and my story

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,440
is very similar

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,880
i was born in a small town in the

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,159
dominican republic

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:44,159
in the caribbean and like many

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,800
many folks uh in search for better life

00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,240
my parents ended up immigrating to the

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,360
united states

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,720
so i was separated from my parents for a

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,519
long long time

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,360
and when i finally got my visa to come

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,880
to the united states

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,959
i was already 11 and i was

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,240
put in a world where i didn't know any

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:09,600
english i often felt like the only one

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
but i did have those allies along the

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
way

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,160
those sponsors that gave me internship

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,800
opportunities

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
gave me projects but at the end of the

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,800
day

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,959
i ended up encountering a lot of these

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,440
labels and stigmas that for me

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,959
was just my identity being dominican

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,600
being afro-latina

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,560
being a woman but for some others

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,160
they've read it

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,680
as as as stereotypes as stigmas of

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,880
things to fight against and so

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,519
i for me and and for josue we ended up

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,560
doing this

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,360
work and leaving the workplace

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,880
because we knew there was a better way

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,800
there was a better way

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,240
to be allies and sponsors especially to

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
the next generation

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,320
i take you through a very recent example

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,680
you don't the reason i

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
left work was because of the police

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,240
brutality

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,600
that i witnessed in the communities and

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,839
i'm sure you heard

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,120
this past year about the black lives

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,640
matter movement

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,160
take on the global stage as people as

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:19,200
allies got in the streets to create

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,680
better relationships between the police

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,880
and communities of color especially the

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,000
black community

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,279
well see that happened to me while i was

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,800
at work

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:33,680
and i remember crying and not

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,800
having anyone to speak about this i wish

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,200
i had an ally

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,079
who would have taken me on a walk or

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,040
invited me

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:42,160
to a meal and simply listen to my

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,600
experiences

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,880
and my stories so these are things that

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
will continuously play out and it'll be

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,279
up to us

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,560
to bring out our allyship to bring out

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,600
our sponsorship

00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:00,880
to actively be there for someone

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,079
so that brings you in to the

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,240
conversation

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:09,120
where do you play um in this world

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,560
what does your identity tell you about

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,600
the way you can give

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,200
fellowship and sponsorship and the way

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,760
you also receive it right

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,440
in some cases where allies in some cases

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,399
we receive values

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,240
in some cases we're sponsors and in some

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,440
cases we're proteges

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,760
where folks that are either at the given

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,160
in

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,800
or the receiving end it's a very

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,680
reciprocal relationship

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,519
but let me take you through a a model

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,160
that might explain

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,120
how this system really works so as you

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,560
see here

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,920
you see coins see money we're all

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,880
born with a bag of coins

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,880
you know and the question is not how

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:56,399
much money we have

00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:00,079
but are we heads or tails

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,760
how many heads and tails do you have

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,920
in your bag which one's better

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
well we we heard this before you know

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,320
heads you win

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,160
tails you lose you don't want to be in

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,160
the tail end of the stick

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:19,200
right so why am i talking about

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,399
these things well coin

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,360
money are a good model for talking about

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
systems of inequality see they're

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,519
twofold

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:33,279
so at the head of the coin you

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,920
my experience privilege just

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,880
because of how you were born you know

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,079
you didn't do

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,040
anything you have advantages that others

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,680
do not

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,120
just because of who you are and at the

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,240
bottom of the coin

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,600
you might experience oppression you

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,480
might see

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
and feel disadvantages that others do

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,040
not

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,000
you did not earn it it's just simply

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,920
because

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,959
of who you are

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,320
and this plays out in a spectrum

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:10,240
of identities so what we see

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:13,839
usually in most um societies

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,959
is that people at the top of the coin

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:20,639
that experience privilege are white

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:24,000
young educated men

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,680
at the bottom of the coin you often see

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,880
women lgbtq

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:34,720
immigrants low income

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,760
folks under resource folks and

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,480
the reality is it hurts to see it

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,600
that the system works like that but

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,079
again that's why

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,320
allies and sponsors are important

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,040
because just like josue mentioned

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,760
just by working hard enough we don't

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,920
have

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,600
we don't we do not all have equal

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,079
resources to get there

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,880
we need allies and sponsors along the

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,160
way

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,320
to help us rebalance the scale

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:07,199
rebalance the system to take you

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,240
through what that process looks like uh

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,279
of really looking

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,320
at your bag of coins that you were given

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,680
at birth

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,720
um we call it you gotta empty your bag

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,240
of coins you gotta

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,639
let go of all these things we carry

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,760
the power the privilege the oppression

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,800
and start

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,360
to really uh understand

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,480
where you play across different systems

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,959
so josue

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,800
what has it been like to empty your bag

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,920
of coins

00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,959
it's been a journey and it's complex

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:45,120
on my end i mean walk into a room

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:48,480
and you may see me with full heads

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,519
and tails and that's visible

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,880
identity there's parts you may not know

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:59,040
for example i am and

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,839
i identify as a man and that is a clear

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,360
head

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,480
in society that said

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:09,519
i'm also a young person

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,920
grew up low income

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,120
and i am a person of color and a son of

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:18,160
immigrants

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,399
and that brings hail and disadvantages

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,680
but for me it is important and in my

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,720
journey i am still

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,120
coming to terms and struggling with

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,120
this journey but the more i get out

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,959
there and i tell my story

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,360
and i share where i come from the more

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,839
comfortable i can be

00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,040
coming to terms with my privilege with

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,680
my gender

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,720
due to my current immigration status as

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,199
an american

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,000
and also come to terms with some of the

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,240
challenges

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,240
that i have in details

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,959
thank you for sharing that and and you

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,959
know i'm sure that um

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,000
for you just went similar to myself

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,120
because of those

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,240
tales sometimes we didn't feel like we

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,720
deserve

00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,160
that level of sponsorship you know we

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,880
internalize

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,240
our oppression to the point that we

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,720
think we didn't deserve

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,639
access to those things so that's when

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,920
allies really come in

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,880
to make someone else feel like they

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,240
belong

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,720
feel value but to do that to hold

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,639
yourself accountable you have to empty

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
your bag of coins too

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,240
so obviously this is just a recording so

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,199
in your own time

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
do me a favor pause the video here and

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,959
do the same

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,839
exercise run through each identity

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,800
category

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,440
and ask yourself as a regards to race

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,079
are you

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,399
heads or tails as a regards to your

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,440
gender are you heads or tail

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:52,959
and really come to terms with how

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,199
your identity plays into this big system

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,160
and hold yourself accountable for those

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,279
identities

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,560
as you give allyship give

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,240
sponsorship as well as receive it let me

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,120
give you a specific example

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,559
of why that helps you so let's say there

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,559
was a colleague

00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,079
that is in the middle of a salary

00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,959
negotiation

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,360
um they stated that that they need help

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,640
so

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,839
first you have to ask okay what can i do

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,919
to support this you start by asking

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,799
yourself

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,160
as a regards to salary negotiation this

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,559
system of

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:36,160
salary compensation um my heads

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,559
or am i in the tailwind so someone like

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,760
me

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,880
is definitely at the tail end data says

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:46,080
black women get paid the less

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,280
in the workplace right um for the same

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,440
amount of work

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,480
but if you're listening to this and

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
you're either

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,280
um male uh in particular

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,280
or you're a white male or you're

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,960
educated to a certain extent you might

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,200
need more on the heads

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,640
so there you say actually i have an

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,640
opportunity to help

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,720
here um because i

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,280
have privileges i have advantages in

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,080
this conversations i did not earn it

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,280
but just because the system works so

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,280
okay great

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,400
you know where you are in the system you

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,640
decided to help

00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,799
you want to be an ally what do you do

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,360
well one thing you can do in this case

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:27,840
is

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,559
demonstrate transparency around your own

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,679
salary

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,960
can be scary right money is we don't

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,600
talk about it right

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,200
but in this case to be an ally

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,360
transparency is key

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,880
and you can also ask your friends your

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,000
colleagues to do the same

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,080
because the more you the more allies you

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,160
have for a specific

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,120
scenario the more effective you're going

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,520
to be

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,679
and why why is important because if

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,919
this colleague that you have sees your

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,120
salary and you have the same role

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,480
they can advocate to get the same salary

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:06,960
as you uh to another level

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,960
again if you're using your nose your

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,520
sniffing senses

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,960
if you're using really taking those

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,640
blinders off

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,640
you're going to ask questions you want

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,240
to facilitate a conversation you want to

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,080
do your research and invite your

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,840
leadership to be part of it and say hey

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,919
let's talk about pay equity

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,000
and why it's important for me even

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,360
though you're not the one getting paid

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,280
less in your case

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,880
pay equity might be important because

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
you know your colleagues are going to be

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,840
more productive

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
they're going to make it easier for you

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,520
you might have

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,480
family members friends who experience

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,320
the same things

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,400
so you're putting yourself in their

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,039
shoes and lastly you can even

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,200
coach your colleague on salary

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,760
negotiation best practices

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,960
what has worked for you and you can

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,840
share that

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,240
in their journey well let's say you are

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:59,919
ready for the next level up right

00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,400
you want to be a sponsor so a sponsor

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,240
again

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:05,039
you're putting your money where your

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,000
mouth is so you're actually saying

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,640
i see the system is not working what can

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
i do

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,880
so if you're a manager position that's

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,640
easy you can just make sure

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,520
that their job offer um or their race

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,080
is equitable so you can actually sign on

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,799
that

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,080
but let's say you're not you can simply

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:27,120
um

00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,280
pay uh for for a course

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,240
and give it as a gift for a salary

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,760
negotiation

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,799
course um again this is what um

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,360
being an ultimate ally means

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,080
uh it takes money takes resources and

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,320
energy

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,640
but that's what it takes to balance the

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,640
scale

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,480
next uh we're going to talk about

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,320
another framework

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,840
because again you're not going to do

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,840
this work overnight

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,880
so we want to give you as many tools in

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,720
that journey

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,840
to help you become a better ally

00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,120
and sponsor josue you want to take it

00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,480
away

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:10,240
thank you to be a strong

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:12,880
ally and a strong sponsor means to

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,919
be aware of your own identity and that

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,280
of others

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,679
and your bag of points you may be asking

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,000
though how do you do that

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:27,120
well we want to propose a way

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,120
and it's to start with

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,440
that may sound familiar because it

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,679
sounds similar to

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,960
a traditional framework that we've seen

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,080
out here

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,760
that was popularized by simon sinek

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,280
where he saw that the trends of

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,919
successful leaders

00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,480
and successful companies is to start

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,919
with

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,799
their why and their purpose but we want

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,880
to challenge you

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:56,240
to prioritize your who

00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,440
over your why and here's

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,679
why no pun intended we all exist in a

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,679
series of relationships

00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,280
our relationship with ourselves our

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,799
internalized relationship

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,960
our relationship with others

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,640
interpersonal relationships

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
and then the relationships of the

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,559
institutions that

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,240
we take a part of whether that's a

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,360
school whether that's

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,799
a company whether that's public health

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:27,200
institution a bank etc and then

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:29,280
we participate in systemic relationships

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,880
which are the governing bodies of all of

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,679
these different institutions when they

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,720
come

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,400
together and specific to us in the open

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,400
source community

00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,440
they are the different open source

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,960
communities that

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,559
we are part of some of them listed

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,840
here within

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,799
all of these groups and networks and

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,080
networks

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:57,039
of relationships different

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,679
experiences i mean you can share a

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,799
little bit of

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,919
our experiences our heads and tails

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,120
our identities but we just cracked

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,440
the surface and

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,760
not only is there a huge diversity of

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,559
experiences

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,799
but we experience these identities in

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,480
very different ways

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,440
or some we may emphasize

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,039
personally some identities over others

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,760
we may think about some

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,480
parts of our identities over others

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,559
others

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,320
may interpret certain parts of our

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,120
identity

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,919
more than we interpret them in ourselves

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,080
some gives us

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:44,000
advantages and disadvantages etc

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,039
here is one example of that using

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,039
an identity will

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,000
so we ask you

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,400
not start with why but actually start

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,640
with

00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,080
who make that deep reflection

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:05,600
about your own identities

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,039
your own bag of coins and also do the

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,559
same for others

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,880
and listen take time to listen to others

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,159
and understand who they are and where

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,720
they're coming from

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,159
ultimately this is going to make you a

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,440
better and more effective

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,880
leader in my case

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,880
what is magu well

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
as you know a sermon who was first

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,039
generation

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,159
low-income son of dominican immigrants

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,559
i am passionate about the power of

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:40,080
telling

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:43,279
stories of redefining narratives

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:45,039
and for me the way i do that my one

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,080
is through delivering training and

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,159
consulting at forefront

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,960
and ultimately that's connected to my

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,799
why which is i envision a world

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,520
where anybody independent of their

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,520
backgrounds

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,600
understood

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,880
with google is going to lead you

00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,960
benefits as an ally and as a sponsor

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,120
as an ally you build more effective

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,919
relationships

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,240
and as a sponsor you're going to uncover

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:19,360
more opportunities

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,360
to be a sponsor

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,559
so just like you can you mentioned

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,679
earlier we

00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:30,080
really encourage you to take time to

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:33,840
do this exercise for yourself write

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:38,720
your own circle and write

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:41,679
your food and here's one way to do that

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,520
sit down and fill out where you

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,400
personally identify in the following

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,400
categories

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:52,240
in this identity wheel and also reflect

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:56,559
how your identity affects your ability

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:59,279
to be a sponsor or an ally

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,159
so feel free to take this for your own

00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,799
personal

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,799
reflection

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,000
and here's another exercise

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,320
a broader view after you started with

00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,919
why

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,760
and think about your own network

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,840
or the people that you're bringing into

00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:25,840
the room or the languages they speak

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:29,039
and what are the identity dimensions

00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:31,039
who has the power who lacks the control

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:33,200
of power

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,120
one of my favorite exercises as well as

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,799
a little bonus

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,640
is this your five closest friends

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:46,799
or colleagues what is their background

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,799
what does your network look like

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,600
additional questions for you to reflect

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,159
on include

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,039
asking tough questions around what are

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,200
the

00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,080
future potential opportunities and

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,600
limitations given my network

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,120
and give it my truth and also ask

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:11,039
yourself

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:14,080
what you want to do different

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,559
so moving forward you're starting

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,559
with who

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,640
now towards the later end of our

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,520
presentation or better set our ladder

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,559
end

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,919
we're going to present three ways that

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:34,480
we can become

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:36,480
a better ally and sponsor right now

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,279
we went through a couple of great

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,799
frameworks emptying your bag of coins

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,919
and start with who these frameworks take

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,240
a long time

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,279
it's a journey to reflect on our

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,080
identities

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,399
build relationships our side our circle

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,120
it takes humility vulnerability

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,559
enjoy the process it's not essential to

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,799
get it right

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,600
immediately but what is important is

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
that you do

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,200
go through that process so you can

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,000
become a better ally

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,720
and sponsor but let's say what is

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,080
something

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,039
you can start right now to at least

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,480
um start practicing what allyship and

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,640
sponsorship looks like

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,480
so for the last part of this

00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,120
presentation we're gonna leave you with

00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,399
three takeaways all right starting with

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,279
number one

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,799
create allyship and sponsorship

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,440
intentional goals

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,279
so we all go through career planning we

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,600
make our goals for the year

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,399
we recommend that you add one around

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,520
allyship

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:40,799
and sponsorship it can be as simple as

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,799
i want to invite three people to my home

00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,279
for dinner to start building those

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,200
relationships and extending my network

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,600
why dinner why something personal why

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,559
something fun because remember

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,960
these relationships are based on trust

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,600
so

00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,559
you can call yourself a good ally or a

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,960
sponsor

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,799
unless you know who you're trying to

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,840
support and help

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,159
let's see another example as a regards

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,919
to

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,799
allyship you can say i want to push

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,200
for my company to create a more robust

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,760
parental leave policy this is a great

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,880
goal

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,360
you're actively shaping the future of

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,559
your

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,919
company and affecting the policy that's

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,720
what allies do

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,200
but let's say you're not as passionate

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,840
about

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,440
parental leave policy uh even though

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,320
it's a very important issue

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,679
it can be about anything but writing

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,399
specific goals

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,960
helps you become a better ally let's see

00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:42,399
one around sponsorship

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,039
awesome sponsorship remembers actively

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,640
promoting someone so you can have a goal

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,000
to at least

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,840
promote one emerging leader in your team

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,399
and let's say you're not a manager yet

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,200
you're not in a position of power

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,039
but you have a very close relationship

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,159
to that decision maker

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:05,440
so you can actively recommend someone

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,559
vet them speak highly of them so

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,440
they have a higher chance of getting

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:12,159
that promotion

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,279
so you still can be a sponsor for

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,360
someone

00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:17,200
now let's take it away to take away

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,840
number two

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,200
number two understand the past but

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,039
re-design the future

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,240
in the european context the past

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:32,240
is many times ugly

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,520
when we look at colonialism and

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,640
imperialism

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,679
we see the european influence

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,399
in the world and

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,159
it's illustrated in this map and it is a

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,120
fact that we need to come

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,399
to terms with and many times we see

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:53,520
history

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,520
repeat itself even today

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,080
erasure of history has led to

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,120
irresponsible design

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:04,080
and many and in many ways is

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,279
influencing when we see the lack of

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,279
diversity

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:09,279
in the open source community today

00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,840
for example only less than seven percent

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,000
of tech professionals in europe are

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:23,519
women

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:27,360
and when we look at open source users

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:30,240
according to a github survey they are 95

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,200
male and open source users and develop

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,880
employers

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:38,000
according to a github survey identified

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,440
as 16 percent

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,600
racial and or ethnic minorities

00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,960
so are we setting ourselves up for

00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,600
longevity

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,159
are we building a sustainable open

00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,519
source

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:57,440
movement design that is achieved for

00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,640
and by communities that make up

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,240
europe is equitable when it's the

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,840
opposite

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,440
it is unequitable we must have designers

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,679
engineers

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,399
team leaders that reflect our

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,399
communities

00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,480
unfortunately there are a lot of

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,120
challenges to that reality

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,399
here we have mr perve from the pew

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,200
research center

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,880
that shares that for many they see

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,120
diversity

00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,600
as a threat or see diversity in an

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,240
indifferent manner

00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,840
that is the reality that we also have to

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,120
fix that we're far

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,519
from getting to where we need to be and

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,399
that

00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:45,840
is coming against the trends the world

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,840
is becoming

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,279
much more diverse africa is the world's

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,679
most emerging and fast growing continent

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,519
and there's a shift we talk about china

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,240
but in 200

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,440
and 200 the biggest countries in the

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,360
world are actually going to be

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,919
india and nigeria that said we have an

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,000
aging europe as we all know there are

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,640
many trends coming together

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,880
asking us tough questions but yes we

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,399
need to understand the past

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:20,080
but redefine the future now for number

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,799
three

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,760
last but not least let's aim for

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:27,600
sponsorship

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,480
over allyship remember sponsorship

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,279
is the ultimate level of allyship and

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,919
it's because

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,679
research tell us that those that have

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,880
sponsors

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,080
stay in their company longer they

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,600
believe they have

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,720
someone that is really really advocating

00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:48,000
for their career

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,720
so being a sponsor goes a long way

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,760
so let's not get comfortable being an

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:55,279
ally

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,840
let's work our way to figure out

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,360
how we can become sponsors and the good

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:02,320
news is that

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,200
the more you work at being a sponsor the

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,399
more you further your own career

00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,280
so thank you so much for

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:13,119
listening and these are just a couple of

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,320
things you can start doing

00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,800
literally tomorrow um just

00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,040
bring more people to the room be

00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,919
someone's hype person

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,639
advocate for someone actively refer

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:28,399
people

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,639
to opportunities and um we're excited to

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:34,639
dig into this work with you thank you so

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:34,639
