	00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,440
hi there

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,639
my name is william morgan and i'm one of

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,719
the creators of

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,560
linkerdy today i'm going to be talking

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,199
about how linker d has been used to

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,680
address

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:21,680
the global coven 19 pandemic

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,960
first let's start with what is linker d

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,960
liquidity is an ultralight ultra fast

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,559
service mesh for kubernetes

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,320
with a strong focus on simplicity

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,000
linkardi was the fifth project ever

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,760
accepted into the cncf

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,360
and has been in production at

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,480
organizations around the world

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,559
for over five years linkery has a very

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,280
healthy and active community

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,800
many github stars many contributors

00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,360
weekly edge releases

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,160
almost every week and of course open

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
governance

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,000
and a neutral home in the cncf linker

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,960
lingerie has recently

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,960
been proposed for cncf graduation

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,680
most of the talks i give about linker d

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,040
discuss

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,159
its features or its roadmap in this talk

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,520
i want to discuss

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,040
the community linkedin has always been a

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,320
community project

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,159
since its donation to the cncf in 2017

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
hundreds of contributors from around the

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,080
world have made linker d better

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,880
through docs code giving talks or simply

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,560
helping each other out one of the most

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
personally gratifying aspects

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,479
of helping to build liquidity has been

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,960
watching this community grow

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,520
in fact the community has grown even

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
more

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,399
by watching this talk you are now a

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,880
member of the linker d community

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,880
welcome

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,399
in late 2019 and extending into 2020

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,920
and to today the linker d community much

00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,719
like the entire world

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240
was affected by the covet 19 global

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:02,000
pandemic

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,159
many of us had friends or family who

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,520
fell ill and sometimes whose lives were

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,360
tragically cut short

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,599
by the virus for many of us beyond grief

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,040
our feelings included frustration and

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,840
helplessness

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
especially early on in the pandemic it

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,160
was

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,599
terrible to feel like we couldn't do

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,760
anything to help

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,440
after all we weren't doctors or

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,480
emergency medical personnel

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,480
or virologists

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,519
but as we learned addressing the coven

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
19 pandemic wasn't just something

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,959
for doctors and medical researchers and

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
one thing

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,200
that was profoundly gratifying was

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,440
learning that lingerie was in fact

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,319
being used by members of our community

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,840
to help

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,200
combat the virus in this talk

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,440
i'd like to highlight four different

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,879
ways that linguity has been used

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,480
these examples are just a sample

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,720
of the many ways that lingerie has been

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
used to address covit19

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,640
and they range from public sector to

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,239
private sector from education

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,360
to healthcare to retail

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,519
and while i'll be highlighting linker d

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,480
linker d of course does not exist in a

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,480
vacuum

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,239
every example i give is a testament not

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
just to the linker d community

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
but to the entire cloud native community

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,840
and its ability to make

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
possible these applications

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,400
the very first example i'd like to

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,360
point out is one of the earliest

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,159
adopters

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,640
of linker d the united states national

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,159
center

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,599
for biotechnology information or ncbi

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:44,400
part of the national institute of health

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,200
several ncbi websites are powered by

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,400
linkerdy

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,640
and have been for years including

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,640
the core covet 19 webpage as well as

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,280
thepubmed.gov website for searching

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,319
over 32 million biomedical research

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,040
citations

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,720
these tools are critical clearinghouses

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,239
for covin 19 research

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,239
and are powered by linker d

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:13,200
the next example comes from the private

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,160
industry

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,919
clover health a linguity adopter built a

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,440
tool to help its employees and the

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,240
families of its employees

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,120
find eligible vaccines this vaccine

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,600
finder

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,479
is powered by lingerie as well as by

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
kubernetes

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,600
and a host of other cloud native and

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,000
open source

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,000
tools

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,880
my third example comes from penn state

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,800
university

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
at the zero day service meshcon

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,360
conference earlier this

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,840
week dom d pasqual and others from penn

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,040
state described how they used linkerd to

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,919
build and power

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,199
a covid test scheduling system for all

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,240
incoming students

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,560
in the spring 2021 semester

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,360
almost 70 000 students were required to

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
be tested

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,280
within 72 hours of returning to campus

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,479
and again

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,639
within the first 10 days after return

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
linkardi was a critical part of the

00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,880
rapid rollout of this

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,960
system which was crucial for protecting

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,280
not just the health and safety

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,080
of penn state students but that of

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,080
faculty

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:27,600
and staff

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,160
finally right here in texas heb

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
100 year old grocery store chain that

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,199
operates

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,520
in over 150 communities and 300 stores

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,320
across texas and other states used

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,800
lingerie

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,320
to rapidly roll out curbside and home

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,840
delivery services

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,600
to allow their customers to get their

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,320
groceries safely

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,840
during the pandemic the heb team was

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,199
able to roll out these services

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,440
dramatically faster

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,720
than anticipated in light of the coven

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,919
19 pandemic

00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,639
by using linker d this story was

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,360
detailed

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,319
at last november's kubecon n a by heb

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,600
team members

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:10,479
justin turner and garrett griffin

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,759
the heb team said we went from being a

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,080
nice-to-have convenience

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,919
to a critical resource for slowing the

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,639
spread of covet in

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,560
texas and especially a lifeline for

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,080
immunocompromised customers

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,240
who did not want to incur risk

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,440
associated with grocery shopping

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
after trying several meshes linkerdy was

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,039
the simplest one and gave them

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,479
everything they needed out of the box

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,160
it was simple to get started with to

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,400
understand and did not introduce

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,840
performance problems gave them exactly

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,759
the features they needed

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,319
and the resilience and confidence to

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,319
move forward

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,280
from these examples i draw three

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,479
concrete lessons the first lesson of

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,039
course is about

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,880
the virtue of simplicity simplicity has

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,840
been a core part of linkerdy's value

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,280
proposition

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:04,000
and is one of its design principles

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,759
each of these community members was able

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
to solve critical problems

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
around reliability and security and

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,120
observability

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,479
for their applications at a time where

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,479
speed especially was of the essence

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,240
they didn't use linker d because they

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,240
thought service meshes were cool

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,840
or because they read a blog post or

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,199
wanted to try it out

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,199
they were trying to build something

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,800
important and to accomplish something

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,880
critical for their customers

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,280
for their students for their researchers

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,800
or for their employees

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,240
and one thing that i'm particularly

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,039
proud of in linkerdy is that in the face

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,319
of a very marketing driven ecosystem

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,240
around the service mesh

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,840
linkerd has stayed strong and continued

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
to focus on simplicity

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,440
the second lesson i draw is about

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,960
community

00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,199
we've worked hard to make linkery a

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
welcoming and encouraging place

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,960
and because of that the linguity project

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,639
has seen incredible examples

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,319
like the ones i described today the code

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,319
and the docs and the energy that

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,720
everyone has invested in the project

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,560
even though is into this very abstract

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,000
thing called a service mesh that's

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,000
difficult to explain

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
to a person outside of our cloud native

00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
bubble

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,599
and sometimes difficult to explain to

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,160
people inside our cloud native bubble

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,520
all that has actually made a difference

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,240
to real people

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,680
in a very concrete and very real way

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,879
whether it's by helping them find

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,280
vaccines

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,640
or get their groceries safely or find

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,839
the research they need

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,479
or get tested when they need to that

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,839
to me is a tremendous demonstration of

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,839
the power of community

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,640
the third and final lesson for me

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,519
especially is one of gratitude

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,959
i am profoundly grateful to our amazing

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
lingerie community

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,080
and i'm grateful to the teams that ncbi

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,680
and clover health at penn state at heb

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
and in all the other organizations

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,640
around the world that are building on

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,600
top of linkerdy

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,040
and using it to address the coven 19

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,720
pandemic

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,240
as every open source community member

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,399
knows the best reward

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,399
in open source is seeing others use a

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,320
project especially for something that

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,800
you yourself feel proud of

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,920
and so on behalf of the linker d open

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,959
source community

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,839
i'd like to say thank you

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,839
