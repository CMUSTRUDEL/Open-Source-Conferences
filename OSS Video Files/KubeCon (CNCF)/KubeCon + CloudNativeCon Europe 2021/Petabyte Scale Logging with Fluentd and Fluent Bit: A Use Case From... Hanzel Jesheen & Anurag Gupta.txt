Petabyte Scale Logging with Fluentd and Fluent Bit: A Use Case From Intuit - Hanzel Jesheen, Intuit & Anurag Gupta, Calyptia

In financial and software companies like Intuit, it’s mandatory to provide a reliable observability layer so internal end-users like developers from different line-of-businesses can access their application data. In the last few years, we faced several problems when scaling up logging. For all the new applications we deployed in our Kubernetes clusters, the data rate increased, creating decreased throughput, higher resource consumption, and unexpected backpressure. In this session, you will learn how we leveraged CNCF projects, Fluentd and Fluent Bit, to configure reliable buffering for network outages, flexible configurations for backpressure management, and tips to avoid common mistakes that will save you hours of troubleshooting. A secondary title for this talk would be: “How we achieved Petabyte scale logging with Fluentd and Fluent Bit”.
