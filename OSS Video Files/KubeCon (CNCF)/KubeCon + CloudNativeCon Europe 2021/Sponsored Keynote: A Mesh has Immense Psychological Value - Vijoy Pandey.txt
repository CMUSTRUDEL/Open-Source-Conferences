	00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,080
hello folks

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,719
i'm v and i'm here to talk about how a

00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,839
mesh

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,199
has tremendous psychological value but

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,640
before i begin

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,880
if you haven't read the hitchhiker's

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,640
guide to the galaxy please get your copy

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,560
today

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,760
that book starts with the protagonist

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,080
arthur dent

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,199
waking up to realize that his world

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
planet earth

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,440
was in the path of an intergalactic

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,000
highway the monolith that was planet

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
earth

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,320
had to be suddenly blown up and arthur

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,480
had to deal with a composable

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,960
interplanetary viewpoint and a very

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,120
large distributed system

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,879
it was in this distributed system that

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,559
he was made aware of the benefits of a

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,559
towel

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,039
arthur learns that in the large

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:56,079
distributed system that is the galaxy

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,239
a towel is the most useful thing a

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,559
hitchhiker can carry with him

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,359
it can do all of these wonderful things

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,199
and help him

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:07,280
in so many situations that you see here

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,280
now let's focus your attention to our

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,280
world of earthly apps

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,119
our monolithic application viewpoint on

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,000
the left whether it be

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,920
bare metal based or vm based is

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
similarly being blown apart

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,960
in favor of a composable large scale

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,040
distributed application

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,600
in this new world of modern distributed

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
apps the physical picture on the left

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
is definitely convoluted but the logical

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
dependency graph

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,119
shown on the right of apis services and

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,600
rpc calls

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,479
is even more convoluted leaving our

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,280
developer

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,119
overwhelmed lost and confused like

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,079
arthur dent was after planet earth

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:48,240
was blown apart and i say this with

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
profuse apologies to douglas adams

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,320
it is then that this developer realizes

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,880
that a mesh

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
is the most massively useful thing a

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,200
cloud native developer

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,040
can explore it has many many practical

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,360
use cases

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,159
so what practical uses does mesh any

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,399
mesh

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
have if you think about what just

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,039
happened

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,640
a monolith got split apart into

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,800
composable elements

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,239
so the first problem is of

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
discoverability

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
what was all in one blob now needs to be

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,120
discovered across a distributed

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
environment so value number one is

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
providing this discoverability

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,200
across various component providers once

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,360
you have discovered these elements you

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,360
need to create something with it

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
so consistency of policy and the

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
consumption layer

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,519
becomes important as value number two

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,720
especially

00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,239
in a heterogeneous environment now that

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,840
we have discovered these elements and

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,319
created something

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,239
value number three is enabling the data

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,280
flow or the flow of information

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,280
between those elements securely and then

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,920
sprinkle performance attributes on that

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,519
flow

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,959
such as scale and availability finally

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,800
observability across all of these

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
elements and up and down that

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,640
distributed stack

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,760
becomes critically important for slo

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,319
adherence

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,680
debuggability and reduction in mean time

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,840
to resolution

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,360
and the only way to manage a large scale

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,480
distributed system

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
is via a declarative paradigm

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,519
since most people are familiar with

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,480
layer 7 service meshes

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,080
let's use those as an example here the

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,480
monolith that used to be

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,239
the app with apis that were probably

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,159
internal library calls

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,519
is now a modern app where the

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,120
distributed components

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:36,720
are services with application level rpcs

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,360
grpcs or other https based calls

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,120
in this situation most layer 7 meshes

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
that we all know and love

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,720
allow for discoverability of these app

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,440
level or layer 7

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,040
service endpoints consistency of policy

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,920
and consumption

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,680
most layer 7 meshes do a great job of

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,000
layer 7 data flow connectivity

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,519
especially within their own domains and

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,439
most are on par

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,920
when it comes to observability and

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,879
declarative management

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,599
now just as not everyone in the universe

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,120
can speak

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,000
vogon not every distributed component

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,599
is a layer 7 service endpoint so let's

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,959
explore a few other types

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,239
in the next few slides for starters

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,959
let's go a little lower down the

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,680
networking stack the monolithic

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,639
virtual or physical router switch

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
firewall

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,199
some network app is being split apart

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,800
and distributed into cloud native

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,880
network functions

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,360
the network service mesh which is a cncf

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,759
project allows for the discoverability

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,880
consistency of consumption secure data

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,720
flow connectivity

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,080
and deep observability of layer 3

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,120
services across

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,360
a large distributed system

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,880
shifting gears a bit let's not ignore

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,960
streaming media

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,919
for one they're the future of traffic on

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,840
the internet

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,040
and the biggest consumer of bandwidth on

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,600
the network

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,000
we at cisco are just about starting work

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,479
on a new media stream mesh

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,600
looking into udp-based streaming media

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,199
sources

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,840
using the same design patterns we have

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,680
discussed so far the media stream mesh

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,360
allows for the discoverability

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,880
consistency of consumption

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,280
secure and scalable data flow

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,479
connectivity and deep observability of

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,680
the performance

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:23,120
of all streaming sources across a large

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
distributed media system now looks like

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,880
let's look at something completely

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,680
different monolithic data lakes are

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,160
undergoing a

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,800
similar architectural transition into

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,680
thinner

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,120
data sources therefore there is the need

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,960
of a data mesh

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
to discover these data sources from any

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,039
provider anywhere

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,919
provide consistency consistent policy of

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,840
access

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,120
and consumption across these various

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,199
data sources

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,639
be able to connect and route the

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,800
information flow

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,720
between these data sources and finally

00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,840
be able to provide observability

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
around access policy compliance and

00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,960
everything

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,639
done declaratively we at cisco are

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,800
proposing one such mesh

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,080
the public health data mesh for the

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
healthcare use case

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,280
in the linux foundation for public

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,759
health

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,199
so summarizing a bit whenever we go from

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,039
an architectural monolith

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,000
to a composable large-scale distributed

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,199
architecture there is a critical need of

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,759
amesh to help us discover consume

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,039
connect and observe your interconnected

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,280
components

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,319
now as a community we have put most of

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,280
our efforts

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,639
into the layer 7 service mesh space my

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
ask of our community

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,319
is to start exploring the bigger

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,280
universe of meshes

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,000
out there finally in case you didn't

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,720
know

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,800
doug adams fans have nominated may 25th

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,360
to be the international tower day

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
in his memory i propose that we

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
seriously consider

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,160
may 25th to also be the international

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,240
mesh day

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,759
as we expand our horizons beyond the

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:57,840
world of layer 7 measures

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,840
into other measures thank you

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
please visit us at the cisco booth to

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,160
view demos around the world of meshes

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
api networking api security and full

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
stack observability

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,960
and please let's keep the conversation

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,960
