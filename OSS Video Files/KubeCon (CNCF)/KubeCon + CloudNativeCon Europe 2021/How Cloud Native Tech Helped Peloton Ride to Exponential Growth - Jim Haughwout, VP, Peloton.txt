hello

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,400
i'm honored to speak today at kubecon

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,559
cloudnativecon

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,279
and especially to speak on behalf of

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,760
peloton and the engineers at peloton

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,279
for years this has been one of my most

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,680
favorite conferences

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,359
it's been a phenomenal chance to meet

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,080
engineers that are working

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,960
hands-on on cloud native technologies

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,840
building it

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,640
using it deploying it sharing lessons

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,399
learned

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,760
and in the spirit of that today i'm

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,000
happy to share how

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,879
peloton is relying on cloud native

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,800
software

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,840
and the community to help us manage

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,840
exponential growth

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,920
as priyanka talked about in her

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
presentation

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,520
uh 2020 was a year of cloud native

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,960
2020 was a hard year for all of us but

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,520
like many other leading

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,280
consumer technology companies millions

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,120
of people turn to us

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,840
in our case accelerating the move to

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,159
home fitness and using peloton services

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
for fitness health and wellness

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,159
this required us to scale how we build

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,680
and deliver our technology

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,680
in so many dimensions

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,640
given the popularity of the ubiquitous

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,960
peloton bike

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,040
it may be easy to not realize the

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,320
breadth of the technology that we get to

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
use at peloton

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,600
and why the cncf is so important to us

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,439
our mission at peloton is to use

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,560
technology and design to connect the

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,320
world through fitness

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,600
empowering people to be the best version

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,439
of themselves anywhere

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,240
to deliver on this mission we work

00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,040
across an amazing range of technologies

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,079
the hardware that you all know and love

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,119
firmware

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,640
iot and mobile edge and streaming

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,360
and of course the cloud native

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,680
infrastructure of compute storage data

00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,520
and everything else that all of us at

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,280
cncf love and use every day

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,360
besides just looking at things like

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,000
bikes or classes at home

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,759
we can even stream classes outdoors a

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
few years ago i used to hike and run in

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,800
the mountains streaming music

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,200
today i run outside and i stream guided

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
running classes of adrian williams

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,800
it gives you an idea of how cloud native

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,840
is so central

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,120
to peloton's delivery of technology

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,239
to our customers at the cncf we like to

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
talk about scaling

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,400
and especially auto scaling in 2020

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,280
peloton scaled

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,040
in nearly every dimension you've heard

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,920
about our triple digit scaling of

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,440
manufacturing capacity but we also had

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,280
triple digit scaling

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
in our application downloads our

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,920
subscriptions our streaming

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
the compute levels every aspect of speed

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,280
and delivery

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,480
today i want to talk a little bit about

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,239
how we did this

00:02:52,480 --> 00:03:00,720
so quickly and while being 100 remote

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,720
and how the cncf played a role in that

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
today's conference in this week's

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,560
conference has a theme of forward

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,920
together

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,360
and at peloton we have a value that says

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,920
together we go far

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,599
perhaps you've seen the hashtag and

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,840
instagram or elsewhere

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,599
this is something we live every day as

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,640
our engineers work together

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,120
to build and base this is how the cncf

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,120
works together as well

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,760
building on each other's tech we get to

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,080
take cncf technology off the shelf

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,760
we get to hire people who know the

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
technology work of the end user

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,159
community

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,760
to share problems and experiences and

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,239
help each other out

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,360
this is why peloton joined not only the

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
cncf

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
but other linux foundation groups like

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,840
the mobile native foundation as well

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,959
using cncf software helps us attract the

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
best talent

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,319
helps them use their expertise faster

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
helps us

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,720
learn and grow faster which is central

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,560
uh to what we do

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,400
i'd love to share a great example of

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
this that shows this in action

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
something that's very much at the heart

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,239
of the cncf

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,239
to the name kubernetes it's a little bit

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
about our move to kubernetes and getting

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,560
our 100

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:18,000
on kate's peloton badge with kubernetes

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
so in the last year we went from a year

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,519
ago we were at

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,600
zero percent of our traffic on

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,400
kubernetes we were using the normal auto

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,199
scaling approaches that most people did

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,759
uh peloton's traffic is inherently

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,080
bursty

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,759
we do special events we have very

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,919
popular classes

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,520
at the same time that base that we're

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,000
bursting and auto scaling

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,600
has been growing at triple digit rates

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,880
that made kubernetes a

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,160
phenomenal technology for us so moving

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,600
to kubernetes we

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,160
basically we hired some amazing

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,720
engineers and engineering leaders

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,320
they were able to quickly take advantage

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,479
of kubernetes

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
documentation the community learn

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,800
lessons learned

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,320
expertise and their own expertise and

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,440
drive us forward

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,880
in less than a year later we move to 100

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,280
kubernetes all of our traffic every day

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,840
but more importantly this allowed us to

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,160
scale for our biggest seasonal spikes

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,400
and to put this in perspective imagine

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,320
whole football-sized stadiums

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,919
whether it's american football where

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,720
football's the rest of the world looks

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,120
at it

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,520
football-sized stadiums of people all in

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,080
the same class with the same instructor

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,800
at the same time then imagine multiple

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,360
stadiums

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,280
at the same time doing that that's the

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,400
kind of compute loads that we work

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,240
through

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,600
and moving to kubernetes has allowed us

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,919
to set those records

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,120
and break those records double them

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,880
triple them

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,800
and quadruple them in the last few

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,479
months alone and we're actually able to

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
do this with less toil

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,520
and to do this just more efficiently in

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,360
general

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,960
i know you would love me to talk more

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,639
about the details of this

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,199
and you will in the community get a

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,880
chance to learn more

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,280
right now our team is working with

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,919
cheryl's team to document this in a case

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
study

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,720
because i'm a big believer that you

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,720
should be able to hear this from the

00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,880
engineers who did this work

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
and our great sres and infrastructure

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
engineers will share that story

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,960
in their own words through the case

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,600
study and perhaps this fall in los

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
angeles

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
in kubecon north america

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,280
well our kubernetes story is amazing

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,960
it's just

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,960
one of the many cncf technologies we use

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
here's a little bit of an idea of what

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,479
we're working on right now

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,360
and what's coming next and a little bit

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,360
of how our ecosystem works

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,800
as i mentioned we don't just work in the

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,440
cloud

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
we work in hardware we work in iot and

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,840
mobile and edge

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,520
we get to pull all these technologies

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,280
together so right now for example we're

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,000
looking at ways to standardize our

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,560
interfaces

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,759
on grpc to make it easier to connect in

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,919
a performant manner

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
with better type safety and better

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,360
developer sdks

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,759
not just across web and mobile and back

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,440
end

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,880
but multiple domains to iot and devices

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
to edge computing

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,080
to our interaction of leading consumer

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,800
technology partners

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,759
making all of that a clean performant

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,960
interaction

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,800
on the grpc standard we're also

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
now taking a look at things like open

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
telemetry

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,080
and how do we monitor and trace

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,039
performance and ultimately our member

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
experience

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,199
across this entire set of technologies

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
apps devices cdns web backend data

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,560
stores

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,639
not just an eye to solve problems but an

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,720
eye to optimize performance across

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,880
all of these technologies to create

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,960
amazing member experiences

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,720
engineers love to optimize and it's

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,800
really fun for us to be able to optimize

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
in all of these areas

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,479
we're also in the process of moving to a

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,639
microservices based architecture

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,560
so we can unlock speed and even more

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,400
speed and productivity

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,000
and in looking at that we're now looking

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,080
at how the cncf has

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
and others have solved problems in

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
service discovery

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,919
perimeter management and of course

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,560
secure service to service communications

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
as we tackle this we're thinking how to

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,440
best

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
manage things like perimeter and service

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,560
mesh

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,680
not just in the cloud or mobile but all

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
the way to the edge

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,759
and to our connected fitness devices

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,919
this isn't just a buzzword

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,400
i know this is uh getting to be a very

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,800
popular term for today this is central

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,199
to our world of connected fitness and in

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,680
connecting our connected fitness devices

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,519
to all of our technology we're probably

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,680
going to find some really interesting

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,800
envoy cases and perhaps envoy mobile

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,320
cases in this

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,039
and that's we'll be exploring the next

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,880
year and of course we're also working on

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,160
as you get into envoy and others uh

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,640
service meshes

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,240
and data meshes as well i think the

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,000
thing here is there are so many

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,320
challenges between mobile

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,360
edge and cloud between cloud native

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,760
mobile native

00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,640
and just amazing opportunities for us to

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,120
challenge

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,839
using cncf and other open source

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,839
technologies

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,000
as i mentioned uh 2020 was a year of

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
acceleration for

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,600
us but our acceleration is not slowing

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,519
down

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
and it's just like the cncf we're

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,399
picking up speed

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,399
in 2021 and beyond

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,000
as we do all this growth we're bringing

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,720
on more and more engineers

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,760
when you bring on lots of engineers you

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,640
basically need to give them

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,120
the best experience possible so they can

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
build

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,120
and write write code ship code produce

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,279
innovate as quickly as possible when i

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,399
joined peloton last year our ceo

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,959
john foley asked if our platform teams

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,480
could work towards a north star goal

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,560
of creating the best developer

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
experience in industry

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,839
one that would be the best place for

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,080
engineers across

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,959
every domain whether it's hardware

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,480
firmware

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,519
edge iot mobile data data science back

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,279
end

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,959
this is an area that the cncf has been

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,880
exploring in the last few years

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,880
the end user community especially has

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,519
been looking on developer experience

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,360
being part of that community has allowed

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,600
us to explore problems together

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,360
and learn from each other it's even

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,440
allowed us to develop and contribute

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,680
some exciting new projects

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,600
and with that i'm very happy to share

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,399
that peloton is also turning to

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,959
backstage

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,839
a cncf project that's near and dear to

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,040
my heart

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,120
from my prior work the cncf community

00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,079
we already have an amazing studio that's

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,160
the world's best

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
fitness instructors produce and stream

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,279
classes to millions

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,040
we want to create the same kind of a

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,560
studio for our engineer so they can

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,480
build and ship code

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
with minimal toil and innovate as

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,160
quickly as possible

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,000
but we're equally excited about finding

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,440
the contributions we're going to make in

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,560
the future as we interact with this

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,720
community

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,399
not just in developer experiences but

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,440
across the entire spectrum of

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,800
technologies

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,079
that we're working in and that kind of

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,720
takes us back to

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,079
the forward together where the together

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,920
we go far

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,519
this type of interaction is just so

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:11,440
representative of the power of

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:13,680
cncf both the software and the community

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,920
knowledge of these technologies opens

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,720
doors to amazing places to work like

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,040
peloton

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,240
and all the other member communities

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,800
through open source

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
you can learn build expertise share back

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,360
to the community as a whole

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000
and then expertise can basically be work

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,320
follow you

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
as you move on in your career and work

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,680
with others

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,000
and build on each other we're really

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,240
excited as a new member of the cncf to

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,079
partner stronger and innovate

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,160
we're also really excited about finding

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,079
some new ideas that we can contribute

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,160
back and show leadership in the

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,800
community as well

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,800
discovering this together with cncf and

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,279
other linux foundation groups is going

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,920
to be

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,519
really exciting for us i want to thank

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,600
you for this opportunity

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,200
invite you to take a look at the case

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
study that comes out from our engineers

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,279
on our move to kate's

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,560
and wish you all a great kubecon europe

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,160
2021.
