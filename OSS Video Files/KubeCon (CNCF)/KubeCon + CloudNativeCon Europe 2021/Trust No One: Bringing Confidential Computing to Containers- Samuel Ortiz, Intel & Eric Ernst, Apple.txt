Trust No One: Bringing Confidential Computing to Containers - Samuel Ortiz, Intel & Eric Ernst, Apple

Today’s containers run in wildly heterogeneous environments. When deployed on multi-tenant clouds, they can span across nodes, regions, and multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) while sharing CSP-owned resources between tenants. In such hostile environments, protecting containers data and code requires full trust on the CSP stack. Confidential computing leverages emerging hardware technologies to build Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) that protect cloud code and data at rest, in transit and in use, allowing tenants to trust no one but themselves. In this presentation, we will describe cloud native gaps for supporting confidential computing through memory encryption, authenticated launch and application attestability. Attendees will learn how secure container runtimes like Kata can close those gaps and leave with a proposed software architecture to bring confidential computing to cloud native workloads.
