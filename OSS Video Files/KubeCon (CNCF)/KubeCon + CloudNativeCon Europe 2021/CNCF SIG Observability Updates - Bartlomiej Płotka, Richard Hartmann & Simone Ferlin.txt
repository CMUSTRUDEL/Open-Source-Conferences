CNCF SIG Observability Updates - Bartlomiej Płotka, Red Hat, Richard Hartmann, Grafana Labs & Simone Ferlin, Ericsson

The CNCF SIG Observability started in Summer 2020 to gather contributors and users from different areas passionate about Observability topics. During this talk, we will be giving an overview of work done, work to come, and areas where you can get involved and help. Consisting of open source project maintainers, standards authors, end-users, and more, we cover a wide range of experience and invite you to join us as well! Help us make the CNCF Observability space better, diverse, and more approachable!
