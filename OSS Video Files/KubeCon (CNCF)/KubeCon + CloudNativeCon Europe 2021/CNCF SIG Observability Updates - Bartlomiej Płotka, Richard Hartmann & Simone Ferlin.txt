CNCF SIG Observability Updates - Bartlomiej Płotka, Red Hat, Richard Hartmann, Grafana Labs & Simone Ferlin, Ericsson

The CNCF SIG Observability started in Summer 2020 to gather contributors and users from different areas passionate about Observability topics. During this talk, we will be giving an overview of work done, work to come, and areas where you can get involved and help. Consisting of open source project maintainers, standards authors, end-users, and more, we cover a wide range of experience and invite you to join us as well! Help us make the CNCF Observability space better, diverse, and more approachable!

hi and welcome to cncf observability

00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,440
updates

00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,920
we have three people today simoni freli

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,360
i'm an observability software architect

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,040
at erickson in sweden

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,799
and a senior at the junction lecture at

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,279
the university of cal state in sweden

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,119
and a sig observability member

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,880
hello richard permitted team member

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,359
openmetrics founder sick observability

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,000
teacher and i work at grafana labs

00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,400
hello my name is bartik plotka and i'm a

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,480
principal software engineer at red hat

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
i am a prominent use maintainer and

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,600
co-author of thanos product project

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,320
i'm sick observability technique and i

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
also write

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,960
book about programming with aurelie

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,960
so let's get started

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,079
what is all of this about well aesthetic

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,039
is a special interest group most of you

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,600
probably know this

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,600
and observability is fundamentally about

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,640
making complex system understandable for

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,800
humans

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,800
there's other definitions but like the

00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,199
distilled version of this is usually

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,399
this

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,520
that as systems become ever more complex

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,840
you need to actually be able to

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,280
understand them as a human

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
and that's what we're working on

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,760
what this also means as we are sick and

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,759
this is a group

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,439
that we want to talk to you this is also

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,200
true for this talk which is why we'll

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
try and optimize towards keeping it

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,360
relatively short

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,520
to have as much q a and open discussion

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,799
at the end of the slot

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,759
look under our charter we are basically

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,040
there to shepherd

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,720
the observability space within within

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
cncf and help different projects

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,400
different end users different vendors

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,759
come into the space and interoperate

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
nicely

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
okay so let's quickly recap what we did

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,399
from

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,159
really the beginning of the cncf seek

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,640
observability creation which was a

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
summer

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,399
last year so the most important duties

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,520
that we

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,079
uh we were told to do is the review

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,560
of the projects that are being proposed

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,079
to

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,600
change the stage um of the cncf

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,959
um um where they are in the in the in

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,520
the cncf landscape

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,400
so stand box incubated or graduated

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
stages

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
um so what we did we submitted four uh

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,800
reviews for four projects

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,560
uh two of them cortex and thanos and

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,959
ended up being incubated

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,400
and uh we kind of spent a lot of time to

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,520
review open matches and

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:30,160
open telemetry uh which are being passed

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,440
uh and the review has been passed to the

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,519
toc

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,879
and are awaiting their decision um so

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,239
that was kind of

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,599
a large chunk of our work but let's now

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,800
look on you know our you know overall

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,200
high level landscape of the

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,319
observability in the cncf

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,959
for better wars we still are you know

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,840
within

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,120
this old-school model of observability

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
free pillars

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
and that we we used to know which is

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,319
metrics tracing and logging

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,159
and the reason is that everything costs

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,159
right so um for example metrics while

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,519
adding less context that you might want

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,640
to to to have

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,400
um in terms of uh you know unknown

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
things that you you should observe

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,440
um still are worth to have because of

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,760
the

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,959
just just the lowest cost for um

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
collecting those and

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,400
visualizating um and usually that's a

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,120
start

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,280
for your journey in terms of you know

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
incident recovery and and finding out

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
what was the risk

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,400
of that incident and what is the overall

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
health of your system right so this is

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,239
what you

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,519
use for alerting and for immediate

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,799
triggers um or calculating

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,720
slo reliably over time right

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
and usually this is a starting point for

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,599
the incident

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,080
duties and with the help of the logging

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,280
this is how you start your debugging

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,840
investigations

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
and typically you would end up kind of

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,239
going into tracing

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,879
only if needed to gather more

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,879
crucial informations about the you know

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,439
their life cycle of the requests

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,840
that happen sometimes between microserve

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,159
multiple micro services in your cloud

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,720
um and um you know that used to be our

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,680
landscape but it is right now uh still

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,120
the case and

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,000
uh this is what what people use on um

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
on production but that's not at the end

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
right like

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
there are things beyond that and and we

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,080
are it was predicted

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,919
you know already two years ago uh that

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
you know there will be more signals at

00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,639
the end you know something that clearly

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,080
uh has appeared is something like

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,240
continuous profiling

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,320
where you want to know your performance

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,400
over time and you want to know

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:48,080
uh you know some historical performance

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,560
you can compare things you can

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,360
uh compare in you know kind of time

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,280
spent

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,639
um cpu time spent per every function or

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
memory allocations

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,039
and this proven to be very uh very

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,800
valuable and there are in the open

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,639
source communities project that

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
that allows you to do so for example

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,560
control

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,520
and at the end there might be more like

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
crash dams

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,160
this is something that um i think is

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,240
very valuable for for richie

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,360
and and i think it would be available

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,080
for everyone but

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,759
um yeah this is some you know uh million

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
dollars idea that that we are still

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,560
waiting to to to have someone to

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,360
implement it

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,520
and within the cnc app observability we

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,600
also have some methods to

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,759
activate more information from your

00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,000
system you would say that those are kind

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,400
of the testing practices that are

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,759
maybe a bit novel in the cloud native um

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,759
you know foundation

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,520
and this is essentially you know

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,800
advanced testing like fuzzing

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,600
or maybe something that i would say it's

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
uh

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,560
fuzzing on production right which is

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,039
essentially cows monkey techniques

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
cal state uh cows testing where you are

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,759
randomly

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,560
uh triggering uh fail uh over scenarios

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
uh in the random parts of your system to

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,840
ensure

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,600
stability and and you know good incident

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,319
reactions

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
so now when we look on the you know

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,120
project

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,039
landscape we've seen some movement from

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,000
the from the last year or from there

00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,199
even from the

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,560
last cube in uh north america

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,280
so we well first of all we we noticed

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,160
there are

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,880
new incubated projects cortex and thanos

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,440
and that

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,479
joined open tracing nothing changed on

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,960
graduation site

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,680
fluency yagar promotions are still very

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,319
prominent

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,160
and and still getting more adopted and

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:41,360
on the sandbox side we see

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:44,880
a new project trickster

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,199
which is you know known from

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,560
amazing caching capabilities on top of

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,400
promotions

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,919
we have open metrics and open telemetry

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,880
which were being proposed to get

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,120
incubated

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,000
and we still have cow smash and litmus

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,199
which are

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,720
our you know chaos testing

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:06,000
projects we have here

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,280
so what's in our to-do list

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,880
in the sig observability so we have some

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,919
activities in progress

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,759
uh mainly a white paper about

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,520
observability so

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,919
all all these stories and

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,039
telling a little bit um talking about

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,440
the foundations of

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,080
observability like like bartek shared

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,720
with you

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,639
previously including other topics and

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,720
most importantly we are including

00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,520
everybody in the siege and inviting

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
everybody to

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,440
to contribute to this document because

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,120
we see that there are people coming from

00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
different areas from different

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,440
industries

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,120
and they might have a different

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,479
references and also different

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,599
input to contribute to this document so

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,440
our goal here is basically have

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:59,440
a cncf stamp or

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,879
let's say a base document when somebody

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,960
comes to the cncf and

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,479
wants to learn more about observability

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,759
what it is and

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,599
how do i get from zero to hero and

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:14,160
what what exists in the landscape

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:15,680
this is at least one outcome we want to

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,560
have in the sig

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,240
the second document is best current

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,720
practices

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,080
on tracing for from the end user

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
perspective

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,560
so if you remember the triplers that

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,840
bartek talked about

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,200
um so we have logs metrics and we have

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800
distributed tracing

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
so in tracing you usually need a little

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,760
bit

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
of education on the application

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,200
development side

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,720
so you usually have to learn how to

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,880
instrument your code and

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,399
which information is relevant from your

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,839
code to be distributed

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,560
with what's relevant to be propagated in

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
a

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,600
in a distributed context when you have

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,320
several

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,160
micro services talking to each other so

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,440
this is a little bit what we want to

00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,080
share in this document

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,480
we have a smaller set of people from the

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,000
sig

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,800
contributing here um usually people

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,920
that already went on this path and

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,399
learned

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,600
from mistakes and learned best practices

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,800
and they want to document and share that

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,560
so and as a backlog we have

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,160
some activities mainly

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,360
webinars on observability

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,839
[Music]

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
and a white paper on overlap of

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,920
observability and a

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,800
i n ml so there is an l missing in our

00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,839
slide but

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,180
we we do want the machine and learning

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,760
aspect of that so um

00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:49,200
[Music]

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:54,080
and a little bit as input

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,080
so learning ways of working

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,800
we are trying to understand or trying to

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,839
to have a little bit of a way of of

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,680
working that

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,800
comes from let's say well

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,519
understood or well operating

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,880
communities such as the ietf if somebody

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,360
is familiar with the internet

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,200
engineering task force

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,800
so how the the process of coming from an

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,920
idea from a project

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,839
from from code to having a standard that

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,240
you can share with

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,600
um other vendors other companies and

00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,959
other developers and

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,360
they all need to interoperate so

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:40,720
in in the cncf or at least in the sig

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,720
we are trying to think about like

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,600
having a clear distinction like for

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,600
example in the irtf and iatf

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,399
what is experimental and more research

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,959
oriented versus what is more engineering

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,240
driven

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,839
problems and implementations

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,320
you can have implementations in the

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,279
experimental and research oriented part

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,399
as well

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:06,000
but trying to distinguish from

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,920
from where the the let's say the impose

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,480
is coming in the community is something

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,320
it

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,320
it's an engineering driving problem

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,959
that's happening in a certain

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,760
industry in a certain part that maybe

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,600
it's not

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,079
the community that i'm coming from the

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,279
industry that i'm working for

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,240
um also have a little bit more

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,880
of a process such as the the request for

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,360
comments in the ietf so like a document

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:33,040
that basically if you want to implement

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,920
a protocol

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,959
you have a document that describes or

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,000
not one but

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,279
a set of them and these documents there

00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,920
is a

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,040
it's not that simple so there is a

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,760
process and

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,240
sometimes a very long process to go from

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,200
a

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,880
proposal to have a standard at the end

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,320
that somebody can

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,560
follow and can rely on

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,079
that standard to be interoperable with

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
another system

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,760
so how how does the yeah

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,360
how should we better implement that how

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:10,560
should we better work

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,399
um should we copy this this way of

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
working should we implement something

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,320
different

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,079
is it interesting to have proposals

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,680
first in a document have

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,600
people who propose like having different

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
implementations and trying to make their

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,079
code to interoperate

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,320
and then based on this interoperation

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,680
you refine the documents

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,079
up until the stage where you have a

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,720
solid more solid document and then you

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,200
could have

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:44,560
an ifc so these are some things um

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,839
we're thinking about and

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:51,680
one thing that um and of course i'm

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,519
not not only trying to implement or copy

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,880
what's working very well from other

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,720
communities

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,120
but one thing that could work very well

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,680
in the same way that works in the itf is

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:07,920
also the mediation between

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:10,079
projects and vendors in a sense of

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,720
the goal is to have a standard the goal

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,680
is to have interoperable standards

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,800
and regardless of from which project

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,200
you're coming from

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
or from which vendor you're coming from

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
the goal here

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,360
is to have code that's running and code

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,240
that

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,480
interoperates

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,760
[Music]

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,560
and is let's say vendor neutral

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,480
so create a community that's based on

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,200
the technical problem that you need to

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,790
solve you need to implement

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,120
and it's less dependent on

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,120
[Music]

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
interests that could be coming from a

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,800
community from an industry or from a

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,600
particular vendor

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,560
well there are just three of us here but

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,839
all the work

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,880
being carried out in the sig uh

00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,160
observability

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,120
is there are lots of helping hands

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,000
behind us

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,120
so the list of people are here and

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,920
apologies if we forgot about someone but

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,079
we really try to include everyone here

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,639
that participate in the calls and

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:17,680
are active in in the sig

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,240
so thank you very much and if you want

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:24,399
to participate if you got interested

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,920
um in what we shared here with you

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,160
so we have our fortnightly calls um

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
the link here is here in the in the

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,440
slide

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,320
we have our repository everything that

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,839
we talked

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,120
about and we we share in the siege is

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,720
public we have a select channel as well

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,480
where people ask coming

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,120
ask things and whatever a mailing list

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,320
and if you have free time to spare and

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:57,120
would like to share with us

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
or no

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,680
so thanks everyone uh come to the seek

00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,440
observability

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,880
and yeah that's all from us

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,880
