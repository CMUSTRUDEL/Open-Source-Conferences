please give a warm welcome to priyanka

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,120
sherma

00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,320
[Music]

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,560
hello everyone remember that time

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,920
it was cute coin cloud native con berlin

00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:23,680
in 2017

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,519
so many years ago it was so much fun

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,119
i remember it like yesterday today is a

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,119
little bit different

00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,160
i'm filming this message with an amazing

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,239
group of people

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,600
who are all messed up and safely

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,440
distanced

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,640
needless to say very different from

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,920
cubecon cloudnativecon berlin

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,840
i miss meeting new people shaking hands

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,840
having conversations

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
and just enjoying myself in the

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,600
smorgasbord of humanity

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,600
that is our kubecons cloud native cons

00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,239
life has changed but cloud native

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
has persevered

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,960
life has been challenging for all of us

00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,680
as we have now shifted into new routines

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
when i think about the kovit 19 era one

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,280
thing

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,799
is clear this is not just a blip in our

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
history

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,920
just like many major world events before

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,560
this

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,080
it is my opinion that we will look back

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,400
at kobit 19

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,840
much the same in this change-filled time

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,799
we have all had to adapt i mean just in

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,200
the past year

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,600
suddenly all restaurants needed to

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,560
figure out how to take an online order

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,240
we needed to learn to work from home

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
pharmaceutical companies had to build

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,600
vaccines in record time

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
using mrna technology and finally

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,960
contact tracing apps had to be built

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,479
within three months

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,520
in privacy respecting manners this makes

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,520
me think

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,360
remember when digital transformation

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,040
used to be a buzzword

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,119
that time is gone now and cloud native

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,079
has been front and center of these

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,840
efforts keeping

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,520
everyone connected it is my belief that

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,480
because of this momentum in the world

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,599
today

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,080
we in team cloud native will usher in an

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
era of technology that will create more

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,920
intelligent

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,959
seamless experiences for the ultimate

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,120
end users

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:30,080
human beings take for example healthcare

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,959
kovit19 has made us innovate faster than

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,160
ever before

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,319
in that space and i'm proud to say that

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,120
cloud native has been the foundation for

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:41,519
this innovation

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,480
let's talk about anthem an innovation

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,480
leader dedicated to improving health

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,519
they use cloud native technologies such

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,959
as kubernetes

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,440
envoy spiffy and open policy agent

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,000
to build scalable applications which

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
require

00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,400
rapid development and deployment

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,800
anthem in collaboration with cloud medex

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,959
mapped covet 19 spread with c19 explorer

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,640
they estimate vaccine availability with

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,040
c19 vaccines

00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,319
and they identify communities at risk of

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,440
food insecurity

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,080
and food deserts with close at home all

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
this

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
is built on cloud native

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,720
these are just a few examples of

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,760
large-scale efforts

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,799
to combat covet 19 that directly impact

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,799
human beings

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,239
and cloud native has been the backbone

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,319
for them

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,280
in the future we will have much more

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,879
data available

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,720
because of the upcoming 5g smart devices

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,640
and i believe we will want to correlate

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,319
it to health

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:45,840
with cloud native's efficiency for

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,400
machine learning workloads

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,000
unique applicability to telco and edge

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
software development

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,120
and a privacy first mindset i see us

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,680
enabling an experiential

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,280
intelligent era for human beings to

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,040
benefit from technology

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,760
rather than be beholden to it

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,319
take for example the daily business of

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,400
food

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,640
and food delivery thank you

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
i was able to order on doordash to our

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,160
shoot location because i knew

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
i'd get hungry i wasn't wrong

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,240
food delivery companies have seen major

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,919
spikes with orders increasing

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,280
more than 100 percent during the

00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,080
pandemic i

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
might be responsible for half of them

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,000
doordash by the way

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,240
uses kubernetes other apps have used

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,880
project spire to securely scale

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
the authentication of critical services

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,600
bringing us

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,800
the restaurants we love and want to

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,240
support right to our homes

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,919
i imagine in the post pandemic era a lot

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,040
of the home delivery behavior

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,960
will stay as will a lot of other digital

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,000
behaviors which we have acquired or

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
accelerated during

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,800
this time with the immense amount of

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,479
data collected by these apps

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,080
they will utilize artificial

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,039
intelligence and machine learning

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,520
technologies

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,560
to provide a more intelligent nuance

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,759
experience

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,199
for human beings both in app and

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,280
irl in store however

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,039
it's no secret that machine learning

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,080
workflows are extremely compute

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,039
intensive and need

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,000
optimal resource utilization i mean this

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,320
is where cloud native

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,440
shines i was actually just talking to my

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,280
friends at ericto

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,440
and they were telling me how they've

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,919
helped the mlops team at shell

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,680
the oil and gas company speed up their

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,800
new energy training models

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
into production 30 times faster than

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,919
when they were using traditional

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,440
ml workflow tools back in 2018

00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,280
we heard from a totally different type

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
of company booking.com

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,440
when they shared how they were using

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,000
kubernetes for their ml pipelines

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,240
a totally different topic climate change

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,319
which is increasingly more menacing for

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,560
all of us world dwellers

00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,520
also greatly benefits from machine

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,160
learning

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,639
and cloud native is an excellent effect

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,720
for those workflows

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,000
let's talk for a second about the human

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,880
beings building all these workflows

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,960
we all of us who build all these things

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,240
are creating the human experience

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,000
with technology and now we're all in

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,160
home offices

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,160
we're actually glued to our workstations

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,120
now that we've worked from home it's

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,880
unlikely people will want the

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
restrictions of a nine-to-five job in

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,880
the office again

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
flexibility will be the key to the work

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,520
in the future

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
i imagine a new human experience where

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,520
our devices

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,759
will help us seamlessly transition from

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,520
in office to at home

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,479
or anywhere in the world really like

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,199
this studio for instance

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,000
while seamlessly sync devices are cool

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,960
being stuck to

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,520
the desk is not fun for most of us not

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,560
the best

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,759
human experience but here too

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,800
team cloud native never ceases to amaze

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,400
just the other day chris from hp shared

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,479
how they were so tired

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,080
of the usual zoom calls and this and

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,560
that that they used

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,240
quake cube which is a kubernetesified

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,880
version of quake js

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,560
that runs a dedicated quake 3 server in

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,960
a kubernetes deployment

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,440
and then allows clients to connect via

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,280
quake.js in the browser

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,960
so the team ended up playing quake 3

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,000
together remotely

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,160
they even used k3s and raspberry pi's

00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,240
talk about edge computing taking off

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,360
because of how critical we are to the

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,759
world right now

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,360
cloud native has grown to new heights in

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,360
the pandemic

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,840
the number of people passionate about

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,240
cloud native is growing

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,120
just looking at our code contributors we

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,240
have grown from

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:05,680
81 000 people in 2019

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,479
to over 118 000 today

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,160
you team cloud native have grown by 46

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,160
percent

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,479
and this doesn't even include all the

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,520
people in this community of doers

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,400
who contribute in other ways such as

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,000
evangelists marketers product people

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:25,280
event organizers

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
the list goes on it was during the

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,479
pandemic

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,240
that we introduced the sandbox process

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,279
for our projects

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,800
today the number of projects in cncf

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,120
has grown by more than 95 percent to 91

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,599
projects in total

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
every day i hear stories of all of our

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
projects

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,519
being used in new and innovative ways

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,720
and that

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,760
includes the sandbox for example

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,680
i just heard lately that project captain

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,200
is used in mission critical clinical

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,360
trial software teams

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,200
who are helping test covid related

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,680
remedies

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,200
inspired by all this momentum we have

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,519
had a 20

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,519
growth in the number of member companies

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,200
in cncf

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,040
two amazing organizations that have

00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,640
joined us lately are at

00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,160
t and new relic at the platinum level

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:20,399
let's go chat with zayn from new relic

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,240
hi zayn thank you so much for joining me

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,279
here today for my keynote with team

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,880
cloud native

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,320
hi priyanka thanks a lot for having me

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,200
here super excited

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,120
awesome so i hear that you're the

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
general manager of open source

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
and pixi at new relic and in addition to

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,720
that

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,120
you're also an adjunct professor of

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,080
computer science at stanford

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,600
that's a lot of work yeah it's totally a

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,560
lot of work but you know i like i like

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,000
sing busy

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,640
that's awesome so what is pixi

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,200
yeah so pixie is a kubernetes native and

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,000
cluster

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,279
observability platform and you know our

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,440
team really built pixie

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,800
uh with the vision that observability

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,640
should be painless

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,560
open and a part of every developer's

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,440
workflow yes

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,720
big believer yeah absolutely um and new

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
relic acquired as

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,720
at the end of last year to really help

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,240
us realize the shared vision

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,839
congratulations thank you so um

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,519
zayn you know here what we've been

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,600
talking about is how

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,959
because of the pandemic that we've all

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,120
been going through

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,959
a lot of human experiences are moving

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,640
online and companies are rushing to

00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,959
digitize

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,839
you have such a rich background i mean

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:33,120
edge computing machine learning

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:34,959
observability there's nothing i can find

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,240
that you haven't worked on

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,640
so tell me how do you see cloud native

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,839
powering this innovation yeah um

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,079
absolutely i'm happy to

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,680
you know give my give my take on it um

00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,800
you know as we've seen in the last year

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,519
it's really no secret

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,560
um that our lives are basically being

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,920
put online

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,600
but you know another change that's

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,959
really been happening is that software

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,000
is starting to get built more and more

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,200
using data

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,519
um you know some people call this

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,680
software software 2.0

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,000
and i actually think that that's going

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
to be a big part of what happens in the

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,200
future because

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,360
machine learning and ai which is a core

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,480
part of this can really leverage

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,720
the improved data processing and compute

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,399
capabilities like cloud native offers

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,000
can you describe a little bit further

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,800
software 2.0 or

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,399
building software with data yeah

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,240
absolutely so you know traditionally the

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,880
way software has worked for for decades

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,320
is that

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,000
you know you write code the code

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
explains like what the program should be

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,040
doing

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,640
and and really you'll end up with this

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,279
imperative program on like how do you

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
actually

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,880
on what the program should should

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
actually what functions of programs to

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,600
actually be performing

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,360
with software 2.0 the idea is that the

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,279
program's actually defined by data

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,800
right so if you want to build something

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
for a photos app which categorizes

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
photos in a particular way

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,839
you would basically build your

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,120
application by giving samples to data

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,120
and having some machine learning model

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
really figure out how that works

00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,240
and because our world's getting more and

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,360
more data-driven and we have you know

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
photos everywhere

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,480
tons of data available we'll be using

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
this this

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,560
data to actually construct the programs

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,800
that will ultimately

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,000
build some experience and one of the

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,200
things that happens over here is

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,959
that you actually will need to even

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,240
build observability for your data which

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
is something that hasn't really

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
really happened and you know my um

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,880
actually some

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,240
uh some of the work i'm doing at

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
stanford is actually around building

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,600
that for

00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,079
for edge-based systems very cool very

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,480
cool

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,519
that kind of ties into probably why new

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,079
relic was also

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,839
a sponsor of the kubernetes on ai day

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,200
absolutely and you know part of this is

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,200
pixi is itself also an

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,480
edge-based uh machine learning platform

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,279
so we do that

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,560
yeah so all sorts of amazing things are

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,480
happening now zane

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,959
i'm curious how did uh new relic decide

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:49,279
to up their investment and commitment to

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,760
cncf and become a platinum member

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,560
yeah absolutely priyanka are an increase

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,240
in investment

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,600
is primarily about making developers

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
lives easy

00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,360
right we really want to make sure that

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
all these observability tools really

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
connect together

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
and developers don't have to deal with a

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,600
bunch of different proprietary standards

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,279
as part of that you know we're we're

00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,560
going all in on open telemetry

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,240
suite um we are also donating pixie

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,240
which is open telemetry compliant to

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,320
cncf

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,360
right and you know we're going to be uh

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,959
using uh

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,320
using this and our investments in the

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,040
community to really help make

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,920
new relic the default observability sas

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,279
vendor

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,440
that is awesome suzanne you

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,200
are a man of many talents a lot of

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
knowledge and if the folks who have been

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,639
listening here want to continue the

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,399
conversation where should they find you

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,920
yeah so you know this year we'll be at

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,600
our virtual booth um

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,199
uh tomorrow so please you know feel free

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,959
to schedule some some time and i'll be

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,800
uh having a chat about it super super

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,920
excited to meet folks in the community

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,000
and chad moore

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,959
awesome so folks go to the new relic

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,360
booth in

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,399
the expo hall and set up time to meet

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,360
with zane

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,440
now that was fun i really enjoyed my

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,680
chat with jay

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,839
all of this is because of you

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,600
cloud native has been the scaffolding of

00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,240
the covet era

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,560
we team cloud native the beautiful

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,279
diverse community of doers

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,800
are the reason this has happened we have

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,680
taken care of each other

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,279
and helped the world i have met many in

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,320
the community who shrugged off

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,320
hopelessness

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,320
with the camaraderie in cloud native

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
i actually made a friend on twitter

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,800
britinje a student in

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,639
india who defeated depression nepotism

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,360
hopelessness about the future

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,079
with internships with us through google

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,240
summer of code and lfx

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,240
today he's a committed member of the

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,880
community inspiring others

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,880
and living our values let's go give him

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,399
a call

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:54,639
hi mr jay hi priyanka and

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,560
welcome and thank you to all the

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,519
community members of cloud native for

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,880
having me here

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:04,000
i am so honored to be here the honor

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,079
is all ours thank you so much for

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,800
staying up so late

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:10,320
no worries at all well no worries at all

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,440
so mutinjay

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,760
any message for team cloud native

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,760
yeah definitely i have i have a great

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,040
message to share as well as a small

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,199
little part of my journey

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,480
as well so before beginning i would like

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,480
to

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,399
pray and hope that whoever is watching

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,320
our video today

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,440
is doing well in this pandemic is

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,240
staying safe

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,480
and taking good care of their health if

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,199
i have to tell you about my story

00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,160
then i think it begins from my childhood

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,959
when i faced

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,079
tumor in leg at the age of 10. i think

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,560
that spirit

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,120
helped me face a lot of struggle that i

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,720
had to

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,680
in my college in college

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,279
i was made to think that life is ruined

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,040
here because i did not join a great

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,440
university

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,639
and i think that affected my mind a lot

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,399
in my first year

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,880
and i was told that i can't achieve my

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,399
dreams ahead i was bullied by few

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,079
classmates for being short

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,079
and that shortness was actually because

00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,639
of my tumor inlet

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,920
however somehow i started using linkedin

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,680
twitter and get

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,759
and i started getting involved in open

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,320
source communities and other communities

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,759
it was then when i started dreaming

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,519
again i started to

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,360
stream again and there was an

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,320
enlightenment within me that how to

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,560
achieve good things

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,639
even by being this in this college by

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,199
being outside the comfort zones

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
and so i got the opportunity to attend

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,880
open source

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,240
summit in europe 2019 and as a

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,320
scholarship recipient

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,440
where i got the opportunity to meet meet

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,399

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,959

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,120
himself

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,120
the creator of linux so that was an

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,639
amazing opportunity for me where i

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,560
got amazing friends as well as from

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,600
international communities

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,839
that helped me achieve internships or

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,440
programs like google summer of code

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,120
where i contributed in open source

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,799
projects like rtms and

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,160

and we are going through another

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,000
transition as we move towards

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,679
the end of this pandemic the

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,440
post-pandemic era will be

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,360
very different from our lives before

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,160
covet 19.

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,880
if nothing else businesses will be much

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,360
more modernized technologically

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
in an era of accelerated digitization of

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,960
business

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,080
we will see a proliferation of data and

00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,160
with the use of edge computing and aiml

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,280
i believe technology will be able to

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,919
create more

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,720
intelligent experiences for the ultimate

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,480
end users

00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,760
human beings as we are building and

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
rebuilding ourselves

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:22,160
and the world around us i think things

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,760
are starting to turn

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,679
vaccines are out and they're looking

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,520
effective we're all

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,919
on different vaccination schedules and

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,240
that has been very challenging

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,200
but there is light at the end of this

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,600
tunnel

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,480
it is my fervent hope that i will see

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,280
