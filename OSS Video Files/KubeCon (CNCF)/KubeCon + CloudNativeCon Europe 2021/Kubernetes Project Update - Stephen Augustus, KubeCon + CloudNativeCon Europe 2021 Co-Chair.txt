	00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,400
hey everyone

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,920
my name is stephen augustus i'm head of

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,320
open source at cisco

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
i'm also one of the kubernetes project

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,080
uh leads

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
for sig release today we're gonna be

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,000
chatting with you about

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
kubernetes project updates uh one of our

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,679
favorite projects in the world right

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,080
uh so if you have uh ever joined me for

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,600
a

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,559
presentation uh you know that i

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
value deeply uh the human component of

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,399
open source projects

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,840
and uh and kubernetes is a project that

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,559
is near and dear to my heart

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,600
so in every one of these presentations i

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,039
always want to talk about the human

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,480
component a little bit

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,879
now if you have uh

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,559
if you have read kubernetes press in the

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:57,680
past

00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,480
you will know that a lot of uh

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,680
a lot of our spokespeople if you will um

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,040
like to talk about

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:09,119
uh project maturity and and kubernetes

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,320
becoming boring uh and i think we're i

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
think we're moving

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,320
steadily towards that point now i'm

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,920
going to practice

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:22,159
a few numbers with you um

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,520
22 38

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,920
34 42

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,960
i like that one and 51. um

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,040
so okay

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,280
practice is over why did i choose those

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,799
numbers uh so if we look back

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,399
into uh the release

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:47,840
cycles uh going back uh going back from

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,320
117 those are the numbers

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
of enhancements that were landed for

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,119
each cycle

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,079
so if you're familiar uh with the

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,680
project you know that

00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,960
enhancements are our nate are our

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,119
designation for for features uh really

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,799
an enhancement is meant to an

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,319
enhancement is a designation for

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,720
a set of work that spans across multiple

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,480
release cycles right so it's not it's

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,520
not easy to encompass

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,840
uh the entire scope of a feature

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,360
in in a single cycle often it takes

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,640
multiple cycles for

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,560
a feature or a set of features

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:30,080
uh components to move from alpha to beta

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,080
to ga or stable so

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,959
enhancements is kind of that bucket that

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,200
we put um

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,879
all of those all of those components are

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,879
the set of components

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,879
that would be uh delivered within a

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,280
release or set of releases

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,400
now so again one more time with those

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,160
numbers

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:56,400
22 for uh kubernetes 117

00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:00,080
38 for kubernetes 118

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,360
34 for kubernetes 119

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:07,360
42 for kubernetes 120

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,360
and 51 for kubernetes 121.

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,760
now with those numbers you can kind of

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,519
see an upward trend right

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,360
we're kind of we're kind of going up up

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,840
into the right roughly you know with the

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,280
uh

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,800
with the exception of uh of of the

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,159
difference between uh kubernetes 118 and

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
um we're trending we're trending upwards

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,599
right and that's that's

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,040
that's nice to see uh in terms of

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,120
enhancement delivery

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,480
especially the the number of

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,640
enhancements going uh

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,599
being graduated or deprecated we're

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
looking at like

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,400
13 uh from uh from

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,239
kubernetes 121. now

00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,599
the reason i mention these numbers

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,959
is it very much so has to do

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,480
with the evolution of process

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,400
right and i think that we're we're

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,840
approaching a point in the

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,680
in the project where we have

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,000
we have kind of iterated over

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,280
different approaches for several

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,120
different things

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,560
and we're starting to find a fit we're

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,439
starting to find a lot of things that

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
work for us

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,040
we're starting to find a lot of uh

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,160
different ways

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,600
in crafting conversations uh to be more

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,120
effective to

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
increase the reach of those

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,240
conversations

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:32,320
so the first one if you were

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:35,919
hanging out with us for uh for kubecon

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,120
n a virtual in 2020 i talked about

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,919
the release cadence and

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,680
again the human component of the

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,960
kubernetes project

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,040
now in 119 we slowed down

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,160
the kubernetes release cadence or we

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,520
elongated

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,360
the the one the 119 cycle right that was

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,639
kind of a special case

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,800
and following that uh following that

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,720
choice this was kind of like the peak of

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:08,080
of um you know of uh kova 19

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
uh as well as uh protests across across

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
the world

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,039
and uh we thought that it would would

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,720
make a lot of sense to

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,800
give everyone uh the time and space that

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,160
they needed to really

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,320
process to be able to do good work

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,360
so we extended we extended that release

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,479
cycle after

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,199
many many discussions now what followed

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,880
were

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,919
uh were several questions about

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,240
would that be the new release cycle is

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,840
is

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,759
now that we've extended it now that

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,800
we've elongated that cycle

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:46,160
um it effectively moved uh

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,880
2020 from the standard four releases a

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,600
year

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,280
down to three releases a year and we got

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
several questions

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,720
is three releases a year going to be the

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
new norm

00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,560
uh so when i chatted with y'all last

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,280
uh we said we're gonna wait we're gonna

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
see

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,000
we're gonna get lots of feedback from

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,960
people we're we're not going to move on

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,199
this decision until we feel that we have

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
we

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,960
have had an opportunity to chat with a

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,840
bunch of different people and and get

00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,240
their takes

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,880
and and kind of incorporate that

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,919
feedback

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,960
into a proposal right so if you

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,520
uh the kubernetes enhancement proposals

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,080
are

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,120
uh caps as they're affectionately called

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,240
uh so

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,280
the uh so sig release along with

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,560
sig architecture and testing

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,199
produced a proposal for

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,080
changing the release cadence and we

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,199
recently landed that proposal

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,440
during the the 120 or towards the tail

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,800
end of the 120 release cycle

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,680
so that means that if you have not heard

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,880
the news yet

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,759
that kubernetes is officially after much

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,440
discussion

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,720
uh moving to a release cycle

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,000
of three releases for the year so it's

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
roughly 15 week release cycles with some

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,639
breaks in between

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,440
some breaks that we try to uh

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,199
try to have considerations around

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,479
kubecon cloud native con

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:21,919
as well as holidays across the world

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,960
um and and what that allows us to do

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,479
is to to take time to to spend

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:32,240
uh spend some effort in areas

00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:35,440
that uh that at times can can often be

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,960
overlooked right uh um areas

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:42,240
like like product management pro

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:45,440
product program uh project management uh

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,639
being able to do triage on active

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,599
uh on on active issues and pr's being

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,280
able to

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:57,360
bring more uh contributors to

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,120
your respective cigs or sub projects um

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
and and give them give them

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,759
opportunities that may

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,960
uh may not have existed in certain areas

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,720
um around triage around

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,240
the the product program project

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,800
management um and

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,319
and definitely not to be forgotten the

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,520
uh

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,720
uh time to uh improve tests

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,639
improve test coverage fix flaky tests

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,960
have discussions around uh the proposals

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,840
uh the the level of of effort that's

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:33,279
required and the uh the amount of commit

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:36,719
that sigs are going to to to to um

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:40,399
to have for uh for the next cycle

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,440
right so overall i think that um

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,000
we are we're fairly confident

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,120
in uh this being a quality of life

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,320
improvement

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,160
for everyone who uh both contributes

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,000
contributes to kubernetes as well as

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,040
those who consume kubernetes

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,480
so thank you to everyone who is involved

00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,600
in those discussions um

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
they're incredibly thoughtful

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,880
discussions um we took quite a bit

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,480
of time to to to ship this because we

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,440
wanted to make sure we had those

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,720
discussions

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
um so as a result of this this

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,880
um i want to go back to those numbers

00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,480
really quickly right so we're looking at

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,839
34 42 and 51

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,080
right uh those are the numbers again for

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,959
kubernetes 119.

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,800
the enhancements for 119 for 120 and for

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,399
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,760
so already um there is

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,920
a there's a net gain in terms of uh

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,519
in terms of the the the enhancements

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,880
that we're able to deliver

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,320
with uh with an extended uh slightly

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,360
extended release cycle right we're

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,000
really going from

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,080
we're really going from about a three

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,360
month or quarterly cadence into

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,040
a roughly four month or 15 week

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,360
uh cadence um so very happy

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,640
uh to see that very excited to see all

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,560
the people who have been pushing

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:08,000
that forward uh including um

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,959
the including all of the sig sub-project

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,760
owners enhancements uh enhancements

00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,360
owners

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,399
uh the release team and uh the wider

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,320
community for

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,160
communicating this message out to

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,519
to downstream consumers as well

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,120
so as part of as part of some of the

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,720
process changes that we've been going

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,640
through in the project

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,640
we've also we've also started to talk

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,360
about an opt-in process

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,000
for the releases and i think the opt-in

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,839
process

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,160
has also had a a a positive effect

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,880
on the uh on the amount of enhancements

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,160
that we're

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,519
able to deliver for a cycle so

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:54,959
what opt-in is is um almost as

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:58,480
as the name implies uh for a sig

00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,399
to uh to sign up for the release cycle

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,320
essentially they have to tell the

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,440
release team what they're planning on

00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,279
committing to

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,079
um and that that turns the

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,839
uh release team model uh for the

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,279
enhancement sub team of the release team

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,399
from a kind of a pull model

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,519
into uh pushing information out

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,519
from uh the sigs into the release team

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,800
so we've we've seen some success with

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,800
that

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:32,720
we have uh as a project sig testing

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:37,200
has worked on uh the removal of bazel

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:40,320
uh within the kubernetes kubernetes repo

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
that is a huge uh quality of life

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,800
improvement

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,240
for contributors especially if you

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,000
consider uh

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,839
especially if you consider new

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,160
contributors or

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,240
contributors that are just recently

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:55,440
getting engaged with the project

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:58,480
having to learn a new framework

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,880
uh essentially for for doing work um

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,639
you know when you may be used to say

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,279
using mate files or

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,920
or you know your handy dandy uh shell

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,040
scripts

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,519
um so i i believe that

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,360
you know the the year plus of work that

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,079
it that it took to put together that

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,880
proposal

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,600
as well as execute on it from uh sig

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,600
testing

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,519
uh has a huge quality of life

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,880
improvement for for the project

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,240
so hat tip to them um the community

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,600
meetings are back

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,720
uh we have been we have changed cadence

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,320
uh you know during during 2020 and and

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
moving into 2021

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,680
we've brought the community meetings

00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,639
back the community meetings are going to

00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:41,839
be a

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,519
more lively forum for discussion uh

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,399
there will be discussions around

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,240
enhancements

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,440
discussions around what's happening in

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,120
the community what

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,680
what you need to be aware of different

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,240
ways for you to get involved

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,680
so i think so i'm very happy to see uh

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,680
the community meetings coming back

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,800
those are uh you know those were one of

00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,839
my ingress points

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,639
when i was getting started with

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,600
kubernetes so i i hope that they are as

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,800
fulfilling

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,320
uh to new contributors and to uh ongoing

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,519
contributors as they were to me when i

00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,920
was starting out

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:17,279
um so with

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:20,480
121 uh with with 121 with uh

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:24,079
1 20 we've had some

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:26,160
interesting deprecations happen uh so

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,360
within previous cycles we deprecated

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,240
docker shim

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,120
and you may be aware that that uh led to

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,880
some

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,639
interesting discussions kind of across

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,200
the community across the internet

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,920
just to be clear deprecating docker shim

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,519
is not

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,760
defecating docker uh docker shim is a

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,279
component that allows us to interact

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,399
uh with uh containers within

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,560
uh the kubernetes ecosystem um it is

00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
uh it is something that is widely

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,079
discussed on

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,360
uh blogs and explained in great detail

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,639
do not worry

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,279
um we have your back there uh and there

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,320
is time

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:06,240
to uh make adjustments as needed in in

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
your running clusters or your clusters

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
to be upgraded

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,519
uh in addition to the docker shim

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,760
depreciation we also have

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,639
uh pod security policies have been

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,760
deprecated

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,959
uh pod security policies have been in

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:21,680
uh it have been in kubernetes since near

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,440
inception

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,760
it's one of the first features or

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,480
enhancements introduced into the project

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,000
um and we're moving on we're moving on

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,360
we have deprecated uh

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,839
pot security policies in favor of um

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,279
in favor of some uh new functionality

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,360
and we will see

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,760
um so the deprecation window has started

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,920
uh during the 121

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,800
cycle and we'll see pod security

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,800
policies

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:52,079
fully deprecated within uh by 125.

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,639
now a few other uh very interesting

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,199
things that

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
have happened um kind of around

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,760
communicating

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:02,800
uh the uh steering committee

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,600
has started to do or we're continuing to

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,399
do now

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,040
uh annual reports for sigs so annual

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,680
reports

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,639
we piloted the annual report program

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,800
within

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:18,079
uh for working groups and now for 2021

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:20,079
we're reflecting as a community on all

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,720
the work that our sigs have done

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,639
uh really across the year and we'll

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,240
continue to do that every year

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,440
um so very excited to see that work

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,279
happen um as you know as as someone who

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,920
doesn't necessarily get to touch

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,320
every sig it's great to be able to go

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,560
back

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,160
and and read information about all the

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,680
the great work that other states have

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
been doing

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,759
asynchronous communications is another

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,399
thing that has has been huge

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,680
especially as we we look at our our

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,800
global situation

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:55,920
121 was the first time that we had

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,880
uh that we had a release team lead who

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,320
was based in

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,120
uh aipac and that has led to

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,959
uh that has led to a lot of rethinking

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,160
of all the processes that we kind of

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,720
we have within the release team

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,759
and i think and i think has has

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,320
encouraged

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,920
a discussion around asynchronous

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,480
communications

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,839
kind of across the community so hat tip

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,279
to everyone who is involved

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:26,399
in improving our processes

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,560
and making them more uh friendly for our

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,759
global community

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,519
so we have uh wrapping up lots of

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,759
interesting things that have happened

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,079
across the last few cycles structured

00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,440
logging is now in beta

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,680
pod resource metrics are are are now

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,560
active uh being able to defend against

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:49,839
logging secrets via static analysis

00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,240
uh for so hot tip to sig instrumentation

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,240
cron jobs are now stable cron jobs have

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,560
been in beta since 1.8

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,920
they're now stabilized of 121. ipv4 ipv6

00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,000
dual stack

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,640
support has gone to beta which means

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,480
it's on by default graceful node

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,480
shutdowns are now in beta

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,880
persistent volume health metrics are now

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
in alpha lots of fun things to check out

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,880
in the community

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,600
but unfortunately that's all the time we

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,520
have

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,720
so when you have a chance check out the
