Scaling Apache Spark on Kube to Apple Scale - Amanda Moran & Holden Karau, Apple

Amanda and Holden will explore the customer workloads that easily ported to Apache Spark on Kubernetes, and which ones had more difficulty. The goal of this talk is to help the audience in their journey as either the operators of an Apache Spark-Kubernetes platform or as an end user. Considerations and best practices for end users of an Apache Spark on Kubernetes platform will be discussed. Additional advice for folks migrating from YARN with HDFS to Kubernetes will be included. This talk will include how to effectively deploy the new enhancements of Spark on Kube, like shuffle tracking and graceful decommissioning, as well as when not to use this.
