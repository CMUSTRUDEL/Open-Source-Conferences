COSI: The Common Operating System Interface - Steven Borrelli, Mastercard & Andrew Rynhard, Talos-Systems

This talk introduces COSI, the Common Operating System Interface, which defines an API for the configuration of container operating systems. While there has been innovation in the development of minimal Linux distributions for running Kubernetes, the distributions diverge from each other in terms of management and API endpoints. Similar to other projects such as the Container Network Interface (CNI) , COSI has a focus on the configuration of the underlying operating system, providing Protocol Buffer definitions and a gRPC API reference implementation for configuration settings such as DNS, network, and kernel settings By utilizing a flexible plugin system, multiple backend implementations can provide a consistent API to consumers. In this talk we’ll review the configuration and APIs of popular container operating systems and Kubelet-node interactions. We will then review the COSI API, the plugin architecture, and demo node management using backend plugins written in Go and Rust.
