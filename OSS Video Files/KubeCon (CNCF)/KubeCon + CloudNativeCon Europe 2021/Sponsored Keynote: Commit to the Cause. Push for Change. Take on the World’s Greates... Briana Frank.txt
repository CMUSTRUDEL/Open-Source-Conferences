00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,280
hi

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,879
i'm brianna frank i am the director of

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
product here at ibm cloud

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,239
and i'm so honored today to talk to you

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,879
about the call for code challenge

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,160
over the past three years call for code

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,960
has proven one

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,480
simple truth teams of developers with

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,360
the right mindset

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,960
the right technology and the right

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,480
deployment ecosystem

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,399
have the power to solve some of the

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,960
world's greatest problems

00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,799
cover code is a movement started by four

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,840
organizations motivated to use

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,119
technology

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,119
for good unlike other

00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,439
tech for good challenges call for code

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640
does not just award a prize and send

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,720
everyone home

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
call for code is committed to deploying

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,920
solutions and to ensure they live on

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
in strong open source projects anyone

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,840
can use

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,840
or improve

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,759
call for code has inspired participants

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,079
from around the world

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,960
to learn new skills and to apply them

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,520
towards the issues that affect them most

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,079
regardless of their experience thanks to

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,360
tools

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,520
from the open source community

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,840
over the years call for code has asked

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,479
for technology solutions to a variety of

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
pressing

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,640
social environmental and justice issues

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,880
with challenges

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,000
formulated by bringing technologists

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,159
together with domain experts

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
by helping developers know how they can

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,439
solve

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
important issues and develop a solution

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,439
that makes

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,399
a real impact we've seen amazing

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,160
creativity

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,480
and we've supported their testing and

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,959
deployment around the world

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,319
in an effort to tackle specific elements

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
of climate change

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
that are of high priority the call for

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,120
code challenge announced three focus

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,879
areas

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,319
to tackle in this year's global

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,400
challenge clean water and sanitation

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,760
zero hunger and responsible production

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
let's take a look at some of the

00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,120
previous winning solutions

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,480
open eew saves lives with an

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,200
earthquake early warning system open eew

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
has deployed a set of low-cost

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,200
accelerometer-based devices

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,200
to detect tremors data is collected

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,239
and processed using kubernetes and

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,560
generates alerts to nearby residents

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,080
this open source-based system provides a

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,720
way for communities

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
without a full national seismology

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,120
system

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:08,080
to gain access to life-saving technology

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,200
the next example is promiteo as

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,280
wildfires

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,680
and other natural disasters become more

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,800
prevalent around the world promiteo

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
protects the health

00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,080
of firefighters primoteo created a

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,319
device

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,159
containing sensors for the toxic

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,959
chemicals that firefighters are

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,159
repeatedly

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,000
exposed to a kubernetes cluster

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,920
hosts several microservices that

00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,640
interpret the iot readings

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,640
calculate long-term analytics and push

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,519
alerts back to ruggedized

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,920
samsung mobile phones and smart watches

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,400
this

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,599
cognitive platform measures toxin levels

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,840
in real time

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,120
and sends color-coded alerts to keep

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,680
firefighters safe

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,239
and finally project al project al

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,239
provides

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,080
critical communication in times of

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,959
natural disasters

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
hurricane maria a category 5 hurricane

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,120
hit puerto rico

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,280
and wrecked havoc on the island not only

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,080
did it destroy people's homes but also

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280
people's

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,280
way of communicating cell towers and

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,519
generators were destroyed

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,920
project al provides a system for quickly

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,639
deploying emergency mesh networks for

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,560
short but critical communication

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,000
their dashboard is based on clown

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
foundry today

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
but they're exploring using kubernetes

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,160
for edge-based devices

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,880
and ibm cloud code engine for faster

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,160
development

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
of containerized apps

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,800
are you ready to answer the call the

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,000
technologies we are building together

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
with cncf

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
can be used to make a huge difference in

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,240
the world call for code is

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,520
also a fantastic opportunity to learn

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,160
new technologies

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,560
including ibm cloud code engine you can

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,000
use

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,560
