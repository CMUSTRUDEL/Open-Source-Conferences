There is a New Spec in Town: Getting to Know the Device Information Spec - Billy McFall & Adrián Moreno, Red Hat

Cloud Native Network Functions (CNFs) will be the cornerstone of the 5G revolution. Unlike traditional workloads, CNFs require access to high speed network interfaces. Unfortunately, Kubernetes traditional networking does not fulfil this requirement out of the box. In order to close these gaps, a new specification has been developed called the Device Information Specification, which expands the existing multi-net specification developed by the Network Plumbing Working Group (NPWG). It not only enriches the information about the network interfaces, but also allows new accelerated technologies to be added and consumed by CNFs using an API-compliant library. This session will give an overview of the Device Information Specification and provide details of how it enables new network accelerating technologies to be integrated into Kubernetes through an end-to-end example.
