Title: Webinar: A Compilers View of OpenMP
Publication date: 2021-06-10
Playlist: Webinars
Description: 
	In this webinar we will look at the interpretation of OpenMP API directives by the compiler frontend, including OpenMPâ€™s interaction with the compiler optimizations and how OpenMP runtimes are used behind the scenes to implement directives.


We will discuss how different implementation choices impact user experience and performance, either explicitly or due to their interaction with optimizations. In addition to best practices, participants will learn how to interact with the LLVM/Clang compiler to determine how OpenMP directives were implemented and optimized. We will follow with time for your questions.


The webinar is presented by Johannes Doerfert, researcher in the Math and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory. He is the code owner of the LLVM/OpenMP target offloading implementation and a member of the OpenMP language committee since 2018 with a special interest in accelerator programming.
