um so the openmp users group has been

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,840
um happening for a couple of years now

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,879
um back in 2017

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
uh tim conference organizer and simon

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,840
mcintosh smith

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,840
met up and started to discuss ways that

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,840
we can help encourage the openmp

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
community

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,120
around around hpc developers in

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,879
particular

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,399
and this led to the first conference

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,160
that happened in oxford

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,760
in 2018 two years ago and then

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,359
last year the conference moved up to

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,000
edinburgh hosted by

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,879
the edinburgh parallel computing center

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,280
this year

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,159
um we're a virtual conference but we've

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,600
used this

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,200
and and tried to reach a broader

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
audience as a result so

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,240
um it's it's been great for us as an

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,880
opportunity

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,240
to expand the audience um into the eu

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,000
and this is something that we're

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
we're really hoping we'll be able to

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,200
continue over over the

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,640
over the following um meetings

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,560
next year we're going to host this

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
conference again this uh next year is

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,439

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,600
form part of the

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,439
i want conference the international

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,079

um that's going to be in september

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,759

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,240

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,880
this year we've had over 110 people

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,520
registered which is a lot more than

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,280
we've

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
had previously it just shows that by

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,159
being a virtual conference we're able to

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,000
reach

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,520
a larger number of people um which is

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,439
which is fantastic

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,439
um we've got 25 different countries

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,280
represented and 67 different

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,680
organizations so this is all

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,479
um a brilliant outreach and it's great

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,640
that we can

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,319
start to build this uh ecosystem and

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,239
community together around

00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,360
openmp uh yesterday there was a tutorial

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,440
on openmp uh going all the way from

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,200
from serial code through all the the

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,120
common core of openmp

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
and the quick stop for lunch before

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
continuing um

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,760
using the the target directives in

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,000
openmp um

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,239
to write openmp programs that will run

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,560
on gpus and there was around 71 people

00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,640
that

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,640
that attended uh during the course of

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,239
the day so that's a really great turnout

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,200
and thank you everybody for joining that

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,200
tutorial yesterday

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,000
as we uh go through today in

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,480
zoom there's a q a button somewhere near

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,640
the bottom where you can

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
you'll find on the menu please use the q

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,480
a for questions

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,599
um it's much easier for us to uh to pick

00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,840
up the questions and then be able to

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,760
relay them to the speakers as we go

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,280
and the chat is there but it's quite

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,920
difficult to keep an eye on that so the

00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,440
q a

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,920
is the um our preferred way for you to

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,200
ask questions of the speakers um we'll

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,319
we'll have you have lots of time for

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,239
questions so please

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,840
answer ask your questions there and

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,720
we'll ask them and relay them to the to

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,360
the speakers

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,879
at the end of their talks we can have a

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,599
number of breaks and during that we're

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
going to

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,879
um show some polls and ask you all some

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,440
some questions about

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,040
how you feel about openmp and um those

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,040
sorts of things so

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,799
um really great if you could participate

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
in them all the feedback is all

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,000
anonymous so we won't know

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,360
who has said what but we'll be really

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,879
interested to learn

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,640
and what the community thinks about the

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,480
questions that we're going to ask

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,760
um so that should be a really fun way of

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,239
getting involved

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,440
