Presentation Abstract :
In the second part, we’ll have a whistle-stop tour of the features in OpenMP for writing programs for heterogeneous nodes with GPUs. We’ll walk through the target directive for offloading both data and parallel execution to GPUs. At the end, you’ll be able to write programs using OpenMP for massively parallel GPUs.
