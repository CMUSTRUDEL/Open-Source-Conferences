Presentation Abstract :
In the first part, we’ll introduce shared memory programming for multi-core CPUs using OpenMP. The most common parts of OpenMP will be explained alongside hands-on exercises for attendees to try for themselves. We’ll discuss some important performance optimisations to consider when writing shared memory programs.
