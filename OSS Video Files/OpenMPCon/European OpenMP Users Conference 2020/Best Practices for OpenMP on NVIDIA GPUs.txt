Presentation Abstract :
The OpenMP target constructs extend OpenMP beyond the realm of CPU computing and allow codes to run on a variety of heterogenous devices. Running on diverse devices, however, requires writing code in a manner that will be scalable to a variety of devices. In this talk we will present an update on NVIDIAâ€™s OpenMP compiler and best practices on how to write OpenMP code that will perform well on NVIDIA GPUs.
