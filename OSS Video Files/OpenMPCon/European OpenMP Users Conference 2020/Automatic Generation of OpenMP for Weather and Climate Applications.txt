Presentation Abstract :
The Met Office is developing a new weather and climate model to exploit exascale computing. This new model, named LFRic, is being written using a Domain Specific Language API and this allows a Domain specific compiler, PSyclone, to generate parallel code for different programming models, such as OpenMP. The DSL approach allows the science developer to be productive by writing code that looks “like the maths”. The code generation then allows the model to be portable and by exploiting different programming models. How OpenMP is being used for CPU shared memory parallelism and how accelerators and other architectures can be targeted will be described. An analysis of performance presented.
