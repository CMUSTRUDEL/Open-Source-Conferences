Presentation Abstract :
In the development of parallel applications that make use of multiple parallelisation techniques including the use of third party parallel libraries, the correct use of OpenMP can be very challenging. We make use of MPI, threads, OpenMP, SIMD, CUDA and SYCL to provide efficient parallelism and the widest hardware support. We will present the challenges we faced developing zCFD to operate efficiently at scale for multiple architectures.
