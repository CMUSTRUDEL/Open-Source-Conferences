hello everyone this presentation is

00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,919
about the membership structure in the

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,080
openmp architecture reward

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,480
i'm michael clem i'm the chief executive

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,240
officer of the openmp arb

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,599
and let's just dive right into the

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,760
contents and

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,439
i'm going to start with what is the

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,720
openmp arb

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,640
so our mission is to develop

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:29,760
and standardize a programming language

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,920
that is based on directive as openmp is

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,520
that is multi-language so the base

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,200
languages here are c

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,920
c plus plus and fortran and what we want

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,000
to achieve

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,680
is to have high level parallelism so you

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,520
don't have to care about specific

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,680
low-level details

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,440
and we want that high level parallelism

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,079
to be performant productive

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,520
and portable and that's what we do with

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,039
openmp

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,280
and the application programming

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
interface the upcoming specification

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,399
that we are going to release

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,760
mid of november is open in p51

00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,240
that's our next minor release on the way

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,520
to have openmp as one core component

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:15,200
of the exascale era we do

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,240
publish uh the openmp api specification

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,000
as a book

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,280
um usually the the main channel for us

00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
to

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,200
publish the openmp specification is as

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,040
an online pdf

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,560
in the recent years we have started to

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,720
also publish

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,040
the specification as books for those

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,280
users and community members

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,439
who want to print the spec and have it

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,920
sitting on their desk in easy reach

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,520
or a good looking book in there in their

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,759
bookshelf

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,320
but we also do publish the openmp

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,200
specification as an html version on

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,399
on the website anyways if you want to

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,520
get that book

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,719
um get it at amazon the link is on

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,960
that page and in the video

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,320
once we have released the online pdf we

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,640
will also release

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,280
the corresponding book version at amazon

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
we sell it at wholesale price

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,239
the openmp arb is a non-profit

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,120
organization so essentially

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,599
we do just charge you for the printing

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,080
cost

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,239
at the amazon publishing service

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,080
so why does openmp matter well first of

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:26,319
all openmp is an open industry standard

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,440
it does matter it's driving the hpc

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:31,280
industry since 1997.

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,040
it is widely adopted and implemented

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,760
across the ecosystem

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,959
there are countless implementations

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,879
ranging from intel

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,280
ibm nvidia to the open source compilers

00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,680
like

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,519
gcc and clang the good thing about

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
this being an open standard is that

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,080
anyone can use it

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,239
for free right so we don't charge any

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,360
license fees to our

00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,560
users or implementers we just

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,319
publish the specification

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,040
to the public and anyone who's

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,720
interested in or has a vested interest

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
to implement it can download the

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
specification implement it and sell a

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,400
product around it

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,080
it is maintained as already said by

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
industry leading companies we'll we'll

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,200
get

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
back to that in a minute and key

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,920
national labs compute centers

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,080
and universities uh influence it so we

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,280
have a good representation

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
between the leading vendors of hpc

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,879
systems

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,640
and compilers for these systems and the

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,599
user community

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,799
and the leading large-scale compute

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,799
centers

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,239
who have a vested interest in in how

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,360
openmp develops and

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,920
we we as a joint group make sure that

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,440
common practice in hpc is standardized

00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,680
as part of openmp

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,480
and as already said it has been helping

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,360
to shape hpc since 1997

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,360
this is when the first version of openmp

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,319
came out for fortran

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,280
and ever since then hp's openmp was

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,480
driving

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,480
hpc and shared memory parallelism in the

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,840
ecosystem

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,840
the openmp roadmap is actually very well

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
defined we have a five-year cadence for

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,479
major releases

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,280
in between we do a minor release at

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,880
least one minor release

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,320
this year we have decided that we add

00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:27,759
openmp52 as a second minor release

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,759
before openmp6 comes out

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,600
and in between the releases we try to

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,479
stay active and engaged with the

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,639
community

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
by publishing at least one additional

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,600
technical report

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,680
that shows feature previews um before

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,639
so that the community can actually

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,160
interact with us

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,080
and give us feedback on the direction

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,600
we're developing if you want to

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,160
visualize that

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,919
so i put a timeline on this slide so

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,240
openmp50 that was our last major release

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,440
in november 2018.

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,280
as i already said openmp51 will be

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,479
released this november

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,000
uh openmp52 right now the next minor

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:09,919
release is scheduled for

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,320
november 21. uh november 22 we will not

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,240
have

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,479
a full openmp release but openmp6 will

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,840
then be the next major version

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,720
coming out in november 2023. and as i

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,560
already said

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
in the in the years where we don't do a

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,280
full release we at least

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,080
publish technical reports so in november

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,120
2019 we had technical report 8 as a

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,840
preview to open in p51

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
this july i believe it was we published

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,520
a public comment draft

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,039
technical report nine that contain kind

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,880
of the final

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,479
thoughts about the openmp51

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,600
specification

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,880
uh shortly before we launch openmp52 we

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,320
will have another common

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,880
public common draft tr to show what's

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:58,000
what will be coming in open mp52

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,479
november 22 will be tr-11

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,600
kind of as a first preview towards open

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
mp6

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
and then as usual public common draft

00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,600
shortly before open

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,039
is released and then you know future

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,400
looking we will have more technical

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:13,600
reports coming

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,680
to show what the thinking of the openmp

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:18,800
airbs

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,039
now coming back to the members this is

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,919
a logo list of the renowned members that

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,080
we have

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,840
on board in the openmp architecture

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,240
review board

00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,880
if you go through the list you see all

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,440
the

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:38,000
important hpc and it vendors

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,280
both for regular traditional host

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,440
execution like

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,880
regular processes but also gpus and

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,280
accelerators

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,160
and when you also look through the list

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:51,840
of non-vendor members we have

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:55,680
the the top-notch labs of the

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,880
doe in the u.s as well as the tier zero

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,280
compute centers from europe

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,960
and japan the membership evolution just

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
to break these members down into

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,120
membership

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,120
categories so since 2018 we do have a

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,800
new membership structure to ease the

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,880
access to the arb

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,240
i'll have more details on the next slide

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,400
about this

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
that's just as an explanation why the

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,120
colors change right in the middle of the

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
graph

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
as you can see the membership has been

00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
growing

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,639
steadily so over time more and more

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,840
members

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,039
joined our community and the arb

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:37,360
to give feedback and provide

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
input into the technical specification

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,000
process

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,319
and the way we develop openmp

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
now as you can see since 2018 we have

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,520
three membership classes

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
advisor member and contributor and the

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,759
membership structure

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,000
basically says that arb members that's

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,800
the highest membership category

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
they get a say in technical discussions

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,199
and organizational decisions

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,879
so they actually can influence the

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,680
strategy

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:12,080
of the arb as a non-profit company

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
of course they have voting rights so

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,039
first of all on

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,639
the organizational decisions and

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:18,400
organizational topics

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,160
but they also have voting rights on

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,960
technical topics so that means

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,120
change tickets technical report and

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,000
specification documents

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,280
arb and advisors and arb contributors

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,120
are slightly cheaper in the yearly dues

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,839
they can contribute to the technical

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,719
discussions and they have voting rights

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,599
on the technical topics again tickets

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,800
technical

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,600
reports and specification documents

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,399
if you're interested in joining and if

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,519
you want to

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,839
influence the direction of openmp please

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,760
let me know you can contact me at ceo at

00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,680
openmp.org or you can can get in touch

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,279
with us through our website through

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,440
twitter through facebook

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,959
through linkedin and some other social

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,360
media channels

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,480
that i can't name because there are so

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,560
many that we're

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,880
engaged with the development process

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,480
that you can influence as a member looks

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,480
as follows

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,320
so the modifications to the openmp

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,080
specification go through a couple of

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,880
steps

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,720
usually first it starts with a proposal

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,720
this is a proposal that can come in

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,920
from research teams from user

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
communities

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,519
uh or from vendors this

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,839
proposal is then implemented in latex

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
that's the

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,279
primary language that we use to develop

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,680
the specification document

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,279
then there are two votes in the process

00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,440
to make sure that everybody

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,200
in the in the air b and language

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
committee is aware

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
of the proposal and the implementation

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,680
in the specification

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,000
if the proposal and the implementation

00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,959
passes all two votes

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,800
then that patch or that modification to

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,720
the specification is merged to the

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,800
mainline version our current draft

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
of openmp and then there's a

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,279
verification path that makes sure that

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,519
all the

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,680
stuff that we applied is actually

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,920
implemented correctly

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,680
um there are a couple of cycles so

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,360
typically what happens when a new

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,279
proposal comes up it is

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,440
iterated a couple of times to make sure

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,839
that it's going into the right direction

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,279
and that all the technical merits are

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
discussed as well as

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,560
all the technical issues that may arise

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,040
when somebody tries to implement that

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,959
in an openmp implementation the

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,519
implementation in latex of course is

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,160
also an

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,240
iterative process where uh you know we

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,760
will do refinements to the specification

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,320
text to make sure it's in

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,519
in line with the style that openmp as it

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,240
as a text

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,519
uses but also that everything that needs

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,680
to be touched in this

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,440
specification is actually being touched

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,040
and verification of course can also be

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,640
an iterative process to make sure that

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,680
we don't introduce any unnecessary bugs

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,760
the release process for specification so

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:08,240
going from the draft document that

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,279
contains a couple of those tickets that

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,640
are implemented in the mainline version

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,480
we do a corrections pass so basically as

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,880
part of the quality assurance we read

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,760
the specification back to back

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,160
um and make sure that we try to find

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,000
every

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,480
everything that we that we possibly can

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,680
find we do an editing pass

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,079
to make the document look pretty like

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
you know

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,480
pagination and stuff then we release

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,360
that as a common draft so that the

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,519
community can come back with feedback

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,839
that is then turned into the final draft

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,480
and once the arb

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,920
members approve the specification

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,120
document

00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,000
it is going to be ratified and released

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,760
to the website

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:57,120
and then consequently to amazon

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,760
for people to print the book all right

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,959
as a member you can also be part of the

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
user outreach

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,320
and education there are a couple of

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
events

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,279
throughout the year that are very very

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,639
important to us in our community so

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,519
first of all there's openmp

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:17,920
con that's a user group conference where

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,240
people who just use openmp or have

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,920
thoughts about openmp or want to engage

00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:25,040
with the openmp arp

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,839
can come give a presentation network

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,040
interact with the arb members and just

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,720
have a good time

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,480
talking about openmp technical topics

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
then there is iwomp the international

00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,920
workshop on openmp

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,160
that is the research workshop where

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,560
it's following the traditional paper

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,680
publication process so people submit a

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
paper draft

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,519
which is going through a program

00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,200
committee and then once invited to the

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,120
workshop they can give a presentation

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,440
they appear in the proceedings

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,200
so the idea is similar to openmp con but

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
it's more like you know in line with

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,200
academia

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,839
and the regular research process then

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,279
there is an

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:07,680
openmp user group in the uk um

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,880
they also have a yearly conference where

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,920
similar to openmp

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:15,519
con people can simply come and indirect

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,399
and you know discuss issues uh findings

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,440
feedback

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,040
around openmp with some of the available

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,959
arb members

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,560
and then of course supercomputing and

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,519
international supercomputing these are

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,240
the two major events for hpc in general

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,920
at sc openmp usually has a booth this

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,880
year of course we do have

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,720
a virtual booth but this is our natural

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,560
conference where we also interact with

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,760
the community we give a lot of

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,839
open and peace whack um to to our

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,880
community so that they can show

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,160
their openmp pride uh and iac of course

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,279
is also

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,920
in germany is a big hpc event at both we

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,279
do have

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,199
openmp tutorials openmp talks

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,720
and that kind of stuff if you want to

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,480
know about that check out the website

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,399
there's an events calendar where you can

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,680
find the specific details about those

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,720
conferences

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,839
and also the links to registration

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:13,040
submission websites and the program

00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,480
all right so to summarize why should you

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,199
be joining the openmp

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,240
arb well there's five good reasons i'm

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,600
sure there's many more

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,959
but these are the five that i could come

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,279
up with so openmp is important

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,480
and it's our members mission to keep it

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,760
that way

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,519
so if you care about openmp uh

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,079
please come talk to us we will be

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,079
happy to help you with questions but

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,360
also take your feedback and accept you

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,399
as a member

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,360
to help us drive openmp as a very

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,120
important hpc program model

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
as a member of course you get first-hand

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,079
access to all the drafts of the

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,160
specification document

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,240
when you look back at the mem

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,199
documentation process

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
um you will see you know there's going

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,560
to be a couple of drafts

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
and you you will see all those drafts

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,920
and you can talk to us

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,680
and you can influence those trust and

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,399
work with us to refine them

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,279
and improve them uh we do actively

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,320
solicit

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,440
input from the from the community and we

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,079
welcome new

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,040
members who want to help shape openmp's

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,720
future

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:24,240
so anything that you may have

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,760
in terms of thoughts or requests for

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,079
improvements

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,680
or potential shortcomings of openmp in

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,360
terms of what you need for your

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,720
applications

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,160
then this is the right way to

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,000
come and see us as a member to help us

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,320
improve openmp and then finally

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,480
you know we are a fun crowd to work with

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,040
we have very smart and proud people

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,920
on the architecture review board coming

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,959
from all sorts of different domains

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,480
and with scientific backgrounds and so

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,120
there's a lot of

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,040
also non-openmp fund that you can that

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,880
you can have with our members

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,160
in terms of you know scientific

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,360
discussions uh

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,639
and other discussions uh of interest
