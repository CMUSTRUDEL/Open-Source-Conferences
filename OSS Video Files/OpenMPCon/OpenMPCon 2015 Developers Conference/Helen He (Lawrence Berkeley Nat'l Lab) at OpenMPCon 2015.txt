okay Helen thank you for joining us at

00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:12,300
the openmp call helen is a hpc

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,130
consultant and Lawrence Berkeley

00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:22,289
National Lab and you gave a very nice

00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:24,480
presentation on the nurse using using

00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,039
over there ve of the applications and

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,330
the hardware plans so that gives you an

00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:32,759
excuse eee consultant you have a nice

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,040
overview of the open EP usage i

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,710
mentioned forty percent of application

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:43,500
of the projects use openmp and hope the

00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:46,620
NPI plus x then fifty percent also are

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:49,410
using opening fee so can you tell us a

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:53,789
bit more on the type of applications

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,520
using the characteristics version so i

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:59,340
am a consultant at supercomputing center

00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,609
north right so nurse face a do in

00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:04,070
facility we support all face basic

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,710
science

00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,750
it's so when you asked me about what

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,729
science applications are using OpenMP

00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,450
it's actually pretty much every as a

00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:17,060
science area mm-hmm yes yes I so you go

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,290
from astrophysics yeah astrophysics

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,610
climate nuclear biologies are all big

00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:27,780
users of opening to

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:31,230
there are some areas are kind of still

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:36,480
need more an hour encouraging to

00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:39,990
adopting OpenMP okay so you gave OpenMP

00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:42,270
courses and nurse yes as we do openmp

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,630
changes and hybrid mkay OpenMP change

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,880
this openmp is now becoming more people

00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,370
more and more important for our next

00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,040
architecture for the current system we

00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:55,020
have we have twenty four cores per node

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,990
and with hyper-threading up to correlate

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:02,450
with the next four resistor we have 72

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:05,580
cores or Hardware threads become 288

00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,560
possible you can integrate open and he

00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,200
was of course we don't encourage users

00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,989
have to scale that pie you don't want we

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,170
don't want users to use 280m characters

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:18,660
or 280 open and his friends would be a

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:23,430
combination of a

00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:27,790
eight to ten like say five to fifteen

00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:32,590
usually we say I'm get asked x 82

00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:35,980
find the sweet spot okay you advise who

00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,480
uses to analyze first the behavior of

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:44,769
the applications to find the sweet spot

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:49,569
forex hybrid mpi opening you measure

00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:52,780
also the twenty percent of oh baby you

00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:54,489
search in terms of CPU hours yes I see

00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:59,139
few hours currently is about twenty

00:02:54,489 --> 00:03:01,870
percent but more higher unwitting see

00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:05,220
the higher core counts they usually the

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:09,760
higher percentage of openmp you stand

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:13,930
birthday yes yes so that's right so you

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,170
did you say SMP nature of course who is

00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:21,100
a high court out high number of hours in

00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:23,110
this can envision you plans for the next

00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:27,450
generation machine will have even more

00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:30,850
pores yes SMP note so you probably

00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:32,560
expect even more opening music we

00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:36,580
expecting a more open until you said we

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:38,770
also are helping applications to adopt

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,170
and I'm pleased some of the recent

00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:44,080
projects we picked our starting from

00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:46,090
adding OpenMP to do application

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,090
some of them already have it today we

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,040
are optimizing it with OpenMP and

00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:53,470
vectorization to open if you can also

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,840
help aggravation the services are

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,760
deconstruct but if you look at

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,400
applications that are used in the

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:06,060
computer system are those mostly user

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,480
applications or commercial off-the-shelf

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:12,520
others have created more more a

00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,760
scientific institution of applications

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:19,420
we have fewer commercial not so many

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,390
commercial okay so you work together

00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:23,970
with users to include open and in the

00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:26,889
phones

00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:31,930
we cannot help out everybody we have

00:04:26,889 --> 00:04:35,130
over 850 projects then our key projects

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,520
are boxes I which projects are covered

00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:41,169
majority of application area so we would

00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,169
share our experience learned without

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:47,200
general users

00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:48,970
web documentation so make

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,400
users aware of the importance of

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:55,350
reproduction okay wait thank you very

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:55,350
much okay good luck

00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,330
