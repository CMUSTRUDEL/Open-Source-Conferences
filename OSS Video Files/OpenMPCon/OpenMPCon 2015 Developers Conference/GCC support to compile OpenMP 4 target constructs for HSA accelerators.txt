Abstract: The talk summarizes our experience from ongoing development of a GCC branch which takes OpenMP code and compiles it so that it runs on HSA GPGPUs. We outline the architecture of the process with emphasis on the differences between compilation for the host and HSA accelerators. Furthermore, we will discuss what kinds of input we can compile in a straightforward manner and, on the contrary, what are the problematic cases and how we have tackled them. We intend to merge the branch to GCC 6, and so the talk will also serve as a preview of what will be available in the GCC released in spring 2016
