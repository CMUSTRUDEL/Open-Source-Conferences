well Oscar and unless welcome to openmp

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,759
calm and thank you for your presentation

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,109
as far as a research staff of Oak Ridge

00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,910
National Lab and I would like to ask you

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:24,689
some questions about the OpenAPI usage

00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:26,010
in oak ridge national lab can you tell

00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,810
us something about the number of

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,700
applications the fields present any idea

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:36,540
of the percentage of hope that we use it

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,390
yeah so a opening be it something to get

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:44,070
this more of you such a day at the lab

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:47,059
because a our notes are getting have

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:51,270
more a capability small pores in

00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:53,940
morrison traitors and for us a using

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,370
openmp in applications as strategically

00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,270
is very important to move to the future

00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:03,270
and through openmp were looking also to

00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:05,460
address the issue of exposing more

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,920
parallelism with applications within the

00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,010
node and at the same time write

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,270
applications and are portable across

00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:19,200
architectures so right now we have a

00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:21,689
applications that use a opening p a the

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,259
traditional way for a cpus and

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:27,450
multicores but we want to explore a

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:31,200
write a note when in pain they

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:33,730
accelerate or a smaller a this is very

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,650
very important for us because we

00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:39,010
in our future existence we're going to

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:45,220
be programming ADP use or accelerators

00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:48,460
with opening before right now in I on

00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:50,680
top of my head a we have a few

00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:55,240
percentage of applications using OpenMP

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,310
a probably in the range of a twenty

00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,940
thirty percent of applications but now

00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:05,410
we are like we want to use opening pin

00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:07,750
all of them so that a you know we can

00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,149
increase its usage and at the same time

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,240
the portability of of the applications

00:02:10,149 --> 00:02:15,490
yeah and you want to focus on using over

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,800
the beat with work for the selectors yes

00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:21,550
accelerator yes with you if you use a

00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,440
and then self hosted in NC on files we

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:28,960
want a single programming model that

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:32,290
works everywhere so we're looking for to

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:37,630
use opening people that a at the same

00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:41,860
time we like that openmp is it's moving

00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:43,750
a fast to the future we just a are going

00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:47,200
to see opening p for dot one this year

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:52,150
and a and we are also looking forward

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,400
for openmp five dot 0 a witch please see

00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,610
that is a we're going to get a big

00:02:54,400 --> 00:03:00,390
changes there and that may help us to

00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,620
manage the complexity of programming

00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:07,090
accelerators or these very difficult a

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,959
computer devices that would be there by

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,959
so that we have in the note

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:17,459
okay well thank you very much and I wish

00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,459
