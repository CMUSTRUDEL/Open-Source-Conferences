I can change well welcome James is a

00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:13,889
director and chief evangelist at Intel

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,240
Corporation and just gave a keynote

00:00:13,889 --> 00:00:21,539
speech at the openmp calm very

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,269
interesting and so you mentioned you you

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,170
gone through many customers get feedback

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:29,789
and openmp and you have you seen the

00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:33,510
opening be used on the variety of

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:36,750
devices what is your experience it and

00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,579
you really see it I think yeah there's a

00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:44,579
lot of interest openmp is dominant for

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,559
note level programming in hpc so there's

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,870
a lot of interest in seeing that stay

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,930
that way so you know it's got a rich

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:54,059
history supporting CPUs and a number of

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,360
the features added starting in the 40

00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,109
version extend that to GPUs and I see

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,000
that as a continuing trend because the

00:01:00,109 --> 00:01:04,979
openmp codes that are in the world and

00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,310
the knowledge are very important to

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,049
extend into that space and I see people

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:12,360
starting to do that and I expect to see

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,520
more of it in the future so you

00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,479
mentioned that you would like open and

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,450
be too

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:25,490
EXPAREL cbus gpus or FB TAS embedded

00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:29,119
sisters and out how can we best go along

00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:31,130
to forward that back right I think I

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,830
think the two big challenges for opening

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:37,009
p1 is making sure that they address the

00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:39,380
ability to use this broad collection of

00:01:37,009 --> 00:01:40,880
devices efficiently and the other is to

00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,240
address something I call composability

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:50,299
which is to find a way for OpenMP to be

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,819
easier to mix and match with libraries

00:01:50,299 --> 00:01:55,009
that use openmp modules that use openmp

00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:57,470
mix and match that today it's a little

00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,539
challenging the nest openmp and get

00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:02,240
effective performance it requires a

00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:04,520
deeper understanding they don't open MP

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,130
than I think that we want to maintain

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,599
long-term so I think that's a challenge

00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:14,599
for openmp to increase its applicability

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,140
and teach ability in the future so you

00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,900
think being able to use open be born in

00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,180
Mozilla form that your bits and pieces

00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,910
in openmp and can plug in your program

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,310
make it easy to use more even more easy

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,680
to use yes if you could be open at

00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,040
pianos open XEL if you mention

00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,569
open in B's fragment-based so it's an

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:42,799
opening cialis is a deeper more

00:02:37,569 --> 00:02:46,250
intricate or standard question opencl is

00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:49,040
different opencl origins are different

00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,310
than OpenMP open mp's origins are very

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,609
much htpc very CPU centric and looking

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,969
to expand opencl comes from a more GPU

00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:01,609
centric world but um i would i would

00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:03,709
describe it as less abstract then open

00:03:01,609 --> 00:03:07,010
in p it's it's lower level it's a

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:10,010
specific design goal analysis to be able

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,230
to utilize any feature that you may have

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,209
in your hardware so it's really

00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:16,730
well-suited to take advantage of special

00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,829
things on GPUs like texture maps or to

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:21,129
be able to take advantage of specialty

00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,719
features that might be present in fpgas

00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:26,870
the challenge is because it's lower

00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:28,909
level it's not as easy to write code

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,400
that would that report in fact it's a

00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:33,169
little bit orthogonal to the goals one

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,849
of the reasons you would use opencl is

00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:37,310
to use features that are unique to a

00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:39,709
particular piece of hardware so writing

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,229
more abstractly so that it courts across

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,900
a lot of devices is not what I see

00:03:42,229 --> 00:03:48,560
opencl used for primarily in production

00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:50,329
so I think OpenMP has a different role

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,519
to play in the industry of being more

00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:54,650
abstract a little more Hardware agnostic

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,389
but has the challenge of stretching

00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,120
across these devices and getting good

00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:02,840
performance yeah so hopefully we will

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,519
see open and be getting expanding FPGA

00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,409
world they used to come so

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,930
hey I think that's inevitable but I

00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:12,970
think it's a very big challenge for the

00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,769
industry and one that I think opening

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,819
Pete we'll meet eventually okay thank

00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:17,819
