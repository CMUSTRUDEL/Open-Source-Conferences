Understanding how and why OpenMP programs lose performance is difficult! In this talk I will attempt to enumerate all the possible ways that OpenMP programs can deliver less than ideal speedup, divided into six main categories: lack of parallelism, load imbalance, synchronisation, communication, hardware contention and compiler non-optimisation. For each category, I will explain why it happens, and offer some possible solutions.
