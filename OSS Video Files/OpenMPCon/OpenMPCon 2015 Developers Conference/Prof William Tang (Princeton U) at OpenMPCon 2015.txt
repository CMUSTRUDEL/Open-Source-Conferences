okay welcome professor tang thank you

00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,809
for joining the open and be calm and

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,950
giving a very inspiring keynote just now

00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:16,350
thank you very much it's a pleasure

00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,189
being here and I really am very grateful

00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:24,240
to all of you organizers like a long and

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:27,199
an end company and it's it's really been

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:31,230
a stimulating experience being here

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:36,210
because surrounded by the openmp experts

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:38,940
from around the world I'm learning some

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,090
very interesting new developments and

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,379
such which will be very important for

00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:47,940
application domains such as the one that

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:52,199
I spoke about yes the fusion energy so

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,670
you mentioned the applications work that

00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,059
you've been doing or your group has been

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,920
doing and at Princeton your professor at

00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:07,619
Princeton and you mentioned also the key

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:10,530
roles of openmp in that development so

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:13,590
the incremental approach and others

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,909
could you elaborate more on those be

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:20,820
sure sure openmp with its capability to

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,820
deal with for example the multithreading

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:28,799
of engaging many many many processors is

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,780
very key to being able for application

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,970
domains like ours which I spoke about

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,340
here in an illustrative sense you know

00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,650
this applies to many different

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,810
application domains that the objective

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:47,250
is to be able to engage the modern super

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:49,140
computing platforms as they evolve to be

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,250
more and more powerful sorts of systems

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:58,290
and OpenMP is a key tool with a bright

00:01:53,250 --> 00:02:01,290
future that we can build upon and for

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:03,000
example during yesterday's presentations

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,440
that are listen to they talk about

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,590
future versions of OpenMP like open mp4

00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,620
with its associated flexibility we will

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:18,860
be engaged on the advanced platforms

00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:22,710
worldwide that will need the openmp

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:26,070
approach to be able to fully utilize the

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,230
machines to our objective is to deliver

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:31,740
at an accelerated pace important

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:35,190
scientific discoveries and that is more

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:38,450
and more of a imperative these days for

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:43,070
the governments around the world I

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:46,500
mentioned during my talk that in the US

00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:51,110
President Obama issued an executive

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,460
order not long ago engaging all of the

00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,410
research agencies that use high

00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:59,310
performance computing Department of

00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,890
Energy and SF National Institutes of

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,460
Health and so forth to be fully engaged

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:09,960
in keeping the US you know at the

00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:12,870
forefront of supercomputing and but the

00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,510
imperative there is not just to evolve

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,440
to more and more powerful systems but to

00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:22,080
be able to utilize those to deliver

00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,390
accelerated results in areas that are

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,760
important for the country with heels and

00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,910
you but you also for the professor

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:35,570
President Xi Jinping of China yes yes

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:39,660
yes very good yeah the so I didn't meet

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:42,690
President Xi Jinping of China but he's a

00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:45,150
leader in China right now his background

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:48,450
is very interesting because his degree

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:52,100
is in electrical engineering obtained

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:55,769
from Ching hai University which is the

00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:58,800
the equivalent of MIT analogous to MIT

00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:01,019
in the US and also where they'll

00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:04,920
organize an I walf a couple of years ago

00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:08,790
yes and so they're very you know very

00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:12,360
aware of what the potential might be and

00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:14,220
he has already made it very clear to the

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,669
high performance computing leadership in

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,049
China that he's very proud of the

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:25,139
achievements

00:04:19,049 --> 00:04:26,789
in China of putting on the floor the 22

00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,470
number-one machines with totally

00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:31,680
different architectures within four

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:34,139
years but now he's saying including the

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:38,370
current can huh to which is by far the

00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:40,680
most powerful system in the world and he

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:45,479
said but the real challenge right now is

00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:49,379
to demonstrate how helpful it will be

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:52,080
for China in terms of impacting areas

00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:56,400
that will benefit the society in China

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,379
and also next year when the openmp Khan

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,650
and I walk will be organized in Japan

00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,659
then we might see some more contribution

00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:07,110
from a Chinese OpenMP community

00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:09,780
absolutely and yes actually Michael Wong

00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,229
talk to me about that too and it'll be

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,379
very interesting to continue to move

00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:18,599
forward in this area and well another

00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,879
point in your presentation where you

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:26,069
discussed the just two example where

00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:29,159
openmp had an edge over MPI yes yes you

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:33,539
say a bit more about that sure the the

00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:36,659
again it comes back to this much greater

00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:40,080
ability to engage many many many

00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:42,449
processors because the extreme

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,819
concurrency or extreme parallel ISM is

00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:46,830
not going away it's going to be you know

00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:49,770
much more strongly emphasized in the

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:54,029
future platforms we already see this in

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:56,069
the early information on the 100

00:05:54,029 --> 00:06:00,330
petaflop systems that are being pursued

00:05:56,069 --> 00:06:02,400
and MPI is very limited in terms of

00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:06,870
being able for example to efficiently

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,599
deal with the multi threading and we

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:14,370
already have seen the powerful impact of

00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:18,539
MPI in multithreading deployment and

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:20,879
being able to engage machines such like

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:25,529
that such as the blue jean q you mean

00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:28,980
open and be apart yes yeah MPI you had

00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:32,880
to use OpenMP it's we and

00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:36,090
and as I also said during my even

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,300
for the solvers you know the Poisson

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:43,380
solvers and such the existing

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:47,250
capabilities by and large deal still in

00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:49,440
a legacy sense with mpi mm-hmm but the

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,860
solvers as they engage more and more of

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,190
the compute run time in advance codes

00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,470
like ours you're going to have to

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:03,750
involve evolve to an open MP capable

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:07,020
solver algebraic multigrid solvers and

00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:10,530
we've identified some already and and

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:13,080
will aggressively pursue that so by

00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,300
certainly by next year we should should

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,270
be able to you know speak to those

00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:21,510
advantages too and just to finish off

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,300
you mentioned that in your presentation

00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:28,890
a new physics result that was obtained

00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:34,140
by HPC simulations right so that's where

00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:37,830
you really have the added value of this

00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:41,970
type of yes yes because in the fusion

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:45,780
area Fusion advanced development of

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,450
fusion energy the biggest challenge one

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,370
of the biggest challenges is to

00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:53,400
efficiently confine this very hot gas

00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:56,580
from escaping and the processes that I

00:07:53,400 --> 00:08:00,560
spoke about today involve turbulent

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:04,580
kinetic dynamics and you can only

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:07,050
capture the dynamics in a predictive way

00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,470
through high performance computing and

00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:12,570
what I spoke about the day was to deploy

00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:16,320
the full power of the modern

00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:21,600
supercomputers aided by algorithms like

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:25,020
OpenMP to be able to gain much better

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,750
resolution boat in phase space and also

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,570
the real grid space to deliver

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,810
unprecedented new results in this area

00:08:30,570 --> 00:08:36,780
that advances the ability to identify

00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,060
how you can best combined is the hot

00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,320
plasma and ultimately the balance

00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,450
between these losses which you can

00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:47,090
completely avoid and the fusion energy

00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:49,490
production from the basic reaction will

00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:52,190
determine the size and cost of a fusion

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:55,160
reactor so it's very important okay yeah

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:58,990
thank you very much for your time and

00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:02,950
hope to see you another opportunity

00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,950
