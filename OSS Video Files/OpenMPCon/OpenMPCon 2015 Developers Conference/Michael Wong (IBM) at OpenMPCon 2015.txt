impressions of the conference I it's I

00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,439
would say it's extremely successful you

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,480
can hear by the number of people here

00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,909
and the noise in the background and the

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,529
excellent questions people are asking

00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:34,810
this is exactly achieving the kind of

00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:37,120
aim we were hoping for and that is to

00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,890
connect the the users and the developers

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,810
with the language designers they're

00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,760
giving us feedback as to what they need

00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,580
and we're giving them feedback as a

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,750
helmet how features are designed along

00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:48,670
with that people are getting a lot of

00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,010
good tips and tricks about how to use

00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,680
openmp as well as exposure into the

00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,820
latest open interview 4.1 features and

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,080
we're having a lot of fun at it too

00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,910
there's no point doing anything less

00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:00,730
it's fun so we had a great banquet

00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:03,010
yesterday we had some great grilling of

00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:05,049
the committee it's today so that's

00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,329
that's always fun when you can help over

00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:09,100

00:01:06,329 --> 00:01:11,740

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,149
way to as the conference moves it allows

00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:42,860

00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,950

and maybe some people from India with

00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,350

to it very good yeah yeah this would be

00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:07,520

people to help so in fact i right right

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,510
now we're gonna have a openmp con

00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:13,280
planning session for next year look at

00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:15,350
what's done right and you know whether

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,870
we can improve for this session maybe

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:19,850
ask more volunteers to help we started

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,160
this mostly as it as may our be driven

00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:24,590
driven method using much of the openmp

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:28,299
staff but ideally for this conference to

00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:33,200
self proliferate it would be better if

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:37,239
if other people volunteer and help ok ok

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,239
