	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
today I will be talking about the

00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:06,379
performance and energy optimization in

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:08,880
putting the applications so i am

00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:12,179
abdullah shah noise body i make easy

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:15,360
student from university of this ship i'm

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,460
doing maybe circle dr barbara chapman so

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,880
as we're in open if they put this stuff

00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,369
with what is opening I know most of us

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,369
maybe know so when a bit usually is the

00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:30,449
de facto standard for our shared memory

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:33,210
from the parallel program and open it is

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:35,309
mainly a quick best parallelism so the

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,250
whole thing is are given away to

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,930
different place to do the work and two

00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,910
kinds of power ism if your existing

00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:45,360
opening each one is regular parallelism

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,610
which is done by work sharing constant

00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,710
so we have some constants and also

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,190
irregular parallelism that's being done

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:54,859
using the fast

00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,640
now as we are going towards the exact

00:00:54,859 --> 00:01:00,350
scale Kyra what tradition like there's a

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,140
lot of talk that how can we go to the

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,030
existent era so let's see what can be

00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:08,600
the main barrier to us they existed here

00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:13,250
but if I Sagan was and his main barrier

00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:16,399
will be power power and power now

00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,369
because we know that really set a limit

00:01:16,399 --> 00:01:23,000
of 20 megawatt hour limit to be to the

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:25,909
exact scale era but as of now we have

00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,670
the largest supercomputer which is

00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:31,520
around 33 patter pitter pop and it

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:34,909
consumes around 17 make out of power

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,450
she's got a huge issue for us to reach

00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:41,380
that limit well previously it used to be

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:44,210
a problem of vendors so as a software

00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:45,920
software stack people please really care

00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,899
about that okay they will manage the

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,429
power and will your programming so we

00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,310
need to go to that as much performance

00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:54,380
and you can gain but now there is no

00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:56,629
more pronounced we all have to chip in

00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,410
the software stack people we have to

00:01:56,629 --> 00:02:03,590
keep into so what kind of solution from

00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:07,879
the software that can we provide to get

00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:09,440
this barrier out of our ways so one of

00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,480
the trash of that we have been getting

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,470
one of the idea that's getting a lot of

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:18,110
traction in the APC community is a

00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:21,040
powerful spent company the main idea

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:24,349
behind power percent of aging is that

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,849
usually you see a lot of application

00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:27,470
they don't really use the maximum

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,690
allowed our of the process

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,510
and as you all know the posture is the

00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:35,600
main power hungry part of the whole

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:38,270
system so in that situation what we can

00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,760
do is that as they are not consuming the

00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,610
maximum power we can have the power in

00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,310
your limit in that sense if we kept the

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:49,220
powerwall limit the same budget you can

00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:51,290
add more nodes and as we all know in

00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:54,740
whole system level if you add more node

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:56,810
we can get more performance so this is

00:02:54,740 --> 00:03:00,050
the main idea between the power of Spain

00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,840
computing so there will be lot of work

00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,970
done in this area sounder but the whole

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,800
idea is that they have been mainly

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:09,140
professional on the whole system level

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,050
performance rather than going to our

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:14,240
notepad organs some of the related words

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,250
you can say that this monster road

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,200
Takashi a party and berry retreat

00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:23,510
they've done some work in this area well

00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:27,709
ok whole system little is coming

00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:30,260
up why do we need to do well like where

00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,410
we know benefit the main idea is that

00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:35,660
although in the system level performance

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,790
they're making a lot performance

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,190
improvement if we want to reach the

00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,010
maximum limit if you want to give the

00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:45,739
pig poo poo we have to improve the

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:50,300
cardinal or prophets also them and we

00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:53,150
all prepare it is the most use internal

00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:54,920
passenger load our programming model so

00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:56,989
what you have to do we have to improve

00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:58,000
the performance of OpenMP opening

00:03:56,989 --> 00:04:00,670
applications

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,710
now how do we do that to improve the

00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,690
performance and energy in co-pending

00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:06,760
certain things we first need to know

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:11,920
that what are the things that actually

00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:15,190
impacts this scenario so as as of now

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,410
most of the applications in the science

00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,329
community is mainly based on what

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,739
sharing constant although there are new

00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:22,780
application that's been coming on

00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:25,330
they're actually in the past based off

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,000
that also so in this part we will mainly

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,120
concentrate on the work sharing part of

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,440
the community now what are these factors

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:37,900
that actually impact the performance and

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,260
energy optimization of virtual

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:44,520
reconstruction first of all how many

00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,520
workers are working in my world

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:52,170
in other words scare you you can do it

00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:55,320
with scheduling policy how much work are

00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:59,580
given to each worker at each time we can

00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,890
do it with some changes then how the

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,370
data is laid out as we all know the dj's

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,290
data moving positive a really big fast

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,230
in terms of completing and also energy

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:13,200
consumption so clear definitely musical

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:17,100
definitely written device of the data is

00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,900
going out and at the end well what do

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,460
the workers to win during the break like

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,650
when they're waiting in the barrier to

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,230
do the juice we can operate with web

00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:27,330
policies so good thing about OpenMP is

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,850
that we can puncture all these five

00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:32,610
parameters in the runtime using

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:35,490
environment variables so what we decided

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,590
up so the main reason actually came to

00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:39,660
this point is whenever we talk to

00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:41,910
different computational scientists they

00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,070
said okay most of the time we don't

00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,840
really care about lot of them so

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,700
whatever we use is let the default

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,030
strategy that have been placed we use

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,830
that detox ready so we decided okay can

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,620
we improve the performance and also

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,590
predict that ok for a certain parallel

00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,460
region what will be the placed on Craig

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,160
erection

00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,800
so for that reason we decided to pay off

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,410
some experimental in our experimental

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,810
with us we selected different parameters

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,800
number of this is a level of tamil of

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:15,539
test different scheduling policy

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,770
different jumps lightest weight policy

00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:21,930
and also to adapt ability the thing is

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,789
decibel saying that our constraint

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,860
computing its arcane node will be under

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:28,289
a certain our family so what we did is

00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,210
that we provide this oxidation selection

00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:34,830
of five different power cap levels and

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,650
for power capping and energy measurement

00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,349
we use to wrap oh and for the kernel

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:44,370
level measurement we use the recent wave

00:06:40,349 --> 00:06:50,039
PT we find our experiments on espero

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:54,349
benchmark so they see how would it be

00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:56,849
surprised so this is the comparison of

00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:59,849
default static compared to the best

00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:03,389
possible settling in for a certain pero

00:06:59,849 --> 00:07:06,270
region so 0 is the just people staring

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,340
and the performance improvement of all

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,479
you can see is the strategy that's not a

00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,919
default static Ram so you can see that a

00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:16,080
configuration selection can improve the

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,430
performance up to ninety percent and you

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,849
can see that in all these 40 kernels 30

00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:25,740
of them actually as a common simpler

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,639
more than twenty percent choosing the

00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,189
best figgity

00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,719
now I decided okay well getting

00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:33,370
performance implement that's really good

00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:35,560
can we do anything about energy

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,469
improvement or not so then we went it

00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:42,639
again and to the configuration that

00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:46,689
saves a lot energy to guess the results

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,669
as you can see here also that compared

00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:51,430
to the default strategy choosing the

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:55,680
best possible strategy actually gives a

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:58,470
lot of lot of energy incremental

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,990
after that we decided okay we are

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,520
getting a lot of improvement under so

00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,030
one of the main important thing is that

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,770
we I talked to the beginning is that in

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,720
different power kept level that a

00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:13,770
certain application doesn't really reach

00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,530
the maximum power so then we going to

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:19,740
look into it very deeply you can see

00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:21,600
this is the five different our camp this

00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,669
is the configuration that gave the best

00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,470
configuration in this our cap the best

00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,570
execution time this is the configuration

00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,940
that is the default execution time in

00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:32,250
that power cap and also this is the

00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:35,159
execution and that gives down this is

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,149
the without any power so without any

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,589
problem or anything so maximum possible

00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:42,979
because you're using for the position

00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:45,540
this is the execution time for time and

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:48,320
if you look at that you can see is that

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,459
in all different high power caps like it

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,540
you can sip choosing the best

00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:55,980
configuration you can save a lot of

00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:58,889
performance you can loop is a lot of

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,769
performance objective arms

00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:04,889
now he's a real interesting fact is that

00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:09,480
if you look into this tube part is that

00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:11,759
this is a 115 wat this is 71 okay so

00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,970
previously we already we have the notion

00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:18,480
is that okay if you increase the

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,429
frequency of the processor but if you

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,189
don't indicate any performance

00:09:20,429 --> 00:09:25,739
improvement when we will not lose it and

00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:27,509
here we can see is that in 70 what they

00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:30,600
actually getting up this performance for

00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:35,579
discarded at seven to one we assume due

00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:37,559
to some IO issue and I Oh issue this

00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:39,569
might be happening so you can see is

00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:42,449
that the base configuration for sr

00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:45,680
incarnate is not the best the maximum

00:09:42,449 --> 00:09:48,110
frequency of the process

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,120
so this is the kind of so what we're

00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:52,779
currently trying to do is that coming up

00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:55,040
with a model so that we can model this

00:09:52,779 --> 00:09:57,890
behavior and choose the best

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,260
configuration when I am NOT application

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:01,850
comes here so it's easy to do like over

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,680
and over or a loan application but when

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,570
you're on the application comes here we

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,670
can do this based on a model

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,910
there were some other words that being

00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:15,240
done in my lab by some of my other

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,210
colleagues one of the work is that how

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:22,260
much these effects the power consumption

00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:23,700
of here can we change the power

00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,940
consumption and based on this

00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:28,670
configuration solution so this one to

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:31,770
the stroke we did an experiment on a

00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:34,050
stream benchmark and here you can see

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:36,660
that you end up with policy number of

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:39,330
fish at person time in the number of

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,340
pain as expected so if you use next time

00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:44,220
more number of Chris usually the power

00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:47,700
will be for more power use because boom

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,670
for fedex is in the same memory and

00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:53,460
other hand most important thing is that

00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:56,250
here is the data process bind or more

00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,740
likely to appear if you choose your pin

00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:00,420
up really well you can save the power

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,830
consumption as the Green Line is that

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,050
where you can see that green line is

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:06,690
very small compared to all of them so

00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,220
that means if false is the default so

00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,140
red one is that before stated before

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,560
opening page you can see that you can

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:16,230
save a lot of power even interior if you

00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:21,210
choose the your configuration wave work

00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:23,370
or casual thing and one of my colleagues

00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:25,530
also working on to ask best so how does

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,680
it affect the energy consumption task

00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:30,260
this application

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,500
so what you did is that we experimented

00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:35,890
on Barcelona opening with us good to

00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,600
application from the ETS and float back

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:41,660
you can see so what you did is that

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,050
initially we look into the Corporal our

00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:46,730
energy consumption he decided okay you

00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:49,880
know that for a second degree is a real

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,330
TV show but most of the time the energy

00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:55,430
consumption effects is the different

00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,050
company events like how many time are

00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,760
you waiting the barrier so how much

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,550
energy or you can say we have in the

00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,390
barrier so you can see that based on the

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,380
different scheduling policy the energy

00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,420
consumption actually carries along and

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,620
also choosing the different number of

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:16,350
paste doesn't really make

00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:18,870
if you use next number of the maximum in

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,490
a flag energy consumption so here we can

00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,370
also see is that choosing the

00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,740
configuration intelligently and help the

00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,510
performance and energy consumption of an

00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,430
applicant like full open except

00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:31,970
occasionally get into a lot of

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:31,970
performance

00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,560
here's how the ongoing work they've been

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:42,720
doing is that we're planning to adopt

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:45,000
this model to a dynamically so let's if

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,430
a new application come see we can do the

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,730
dynamic adaptation without that users

00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:53,760
any so what will happen is that the user

00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,610
will give their code it will run just

00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,000
like any old but they will get a lot of

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,430
parking system manages we're planning

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,620
we're actually working on so our initial

00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:06,780
work represented is mainly relationship

00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,730
anyways compiler now we are actually

00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:10,730
looking into different open-ended online

00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:13,710
because based on different

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,720
implementation things may vary the model

00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,130
may vary so to fit the model we're

00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,920
looking into different open appear on

00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:23,910
time open you ate GCC and also into a

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,710
vodka and also as we know that different

00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,050
architecture also has different way to

00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:31,200
handle things so we're also looking into

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:35,190
different architectures into sandy beach

00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:37,050
and also IBM power8 now some of the

00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,440
future work so what can it do in the

00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:43,170
future how the future works as you saw

00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,060
that just of the configuration is

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,280
selected it was a discrete

00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,200
configurations but this calculation are

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,170
not very discreet they can support

00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,090
schedule for chunk sizes we use 7th

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,550
district or figuration and they can go

00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:57,670
from one to three so that Oh like a

00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,320
continuous

00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,960
so what we're going to do is that we can

00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,690
actually make a more complete model for

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,280
this information center channel and we

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:08,440
didn't look into VLAN capping yet so

00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,820
we're planning also to be physical how

00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:13,120
does it affect the performance if we

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,920
kept update empower and also we can use

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,720
some other energy efficient strategies

00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:23,380
like DP a pest or conferences rofling

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,440
absolutely modulation and definitely

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,840
last but not the least because and then

00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,760
we want it to run in a bigger inaudible

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,340
so definitely we had to combine it with

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:38,140
a distributed completely distributed

00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:41,950
programming model such as MPI so this

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:44,440
was mainly my talk so i decided i tried

00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:46,600
to in overview that what is the main

00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,240
reason propane in the application or

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,190
comments like how can you be the

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,820
definitive

00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:59,230
we given the factors and also use some

00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:02,950
experimental results you also feel sorry

00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:06,090
what can we do in the future so this if

00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:06,090
