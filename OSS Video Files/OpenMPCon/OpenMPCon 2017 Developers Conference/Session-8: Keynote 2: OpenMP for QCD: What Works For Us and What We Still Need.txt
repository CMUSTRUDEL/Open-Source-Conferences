Title: Session-8: Keynote 2: OpenMP for QCD: What Works For Us and What We Still Need
Publication date: 2017-10-15
Playlist: OpenMPCon 2017 Developers Conference
Description: 
	Dr. Meifeng Lin, Associate Computational Scientist, Computational Science Initiative of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)
Dr. Lin’s research interests include computational physics, high performance computing and numerical algorithms, with a focus on lattice quantum chromodynamics – a numerical approach to understand the fundamental interactions of particles and their effects on our visible world. In this keynote Dr Lin will will survey the common OpenMP directives used in lattice QCD software, and provide a personal wish list for OpenMP features that we may need towards the exascale computing era.
