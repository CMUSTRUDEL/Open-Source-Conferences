The foundation is also a community to advance adoption of CI/CD best practices and tools. This talk outlines the initiatives and ways to get involved so we can all work together to accelerate CI/CD adoption. CDF includes projects in the cloud native space so this talk will highlight those and the GitOps efforts there to uncover opportunities for cross-community collaboration. This talk also looks at initiatives toward interoperability between open source projects and share how you can get involved so we can all work together in open source to drive forward the direction of CI/CD and make software delivery & GitOps better for all.
