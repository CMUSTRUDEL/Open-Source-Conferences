Title: Cloud-native Patterns - Ops Edition
Publication date: 2021-05-03
Playlist: GitOpsCon 2021
Description: 
	Itâ€™s been roughly a decade since 12factor.net was first published by some engineers working with and on Heroku, arguably one of the first, truly successful developer/DevOps platforms. Many of the practices hinted at and described therein have become de facto-standards - mature source code control and continuous integration, horizontal scaling, and loose coupling, for example - but arguably most address the earlier parts of the SDLC. A similar level of maturity is lagging on the operational end of that lifecycle.

That is where GitOps comes in. Building on the foundational elements of declarative configuration and reconciliation (popularized by Kubernetes), GitOps brings a model for management of that declarative configuration and a disciplined set of operational practices that are ideally suited for cloud-native systems. The result is an increase in developer productivity (more frequent releases, anybody?) and operational excellence (you still want compliance, no?). GitOps offers cloud-native patterns expressly for operations.

To kick off the first ever GitOps Con, Weaveworks CTO, Cornelia Davis will share the history of and vision for the GitOps movement. She will talk about how the industry is coming together as the GitOps Working Group to advance innovation and understanding of this industry leading paradigm. And she will present the first artifact of the CNCF OpenGitOps sandbox project: GitOps Principles.
