Title: Closing the gap: OpenShift in a disconnected environment with GitOps
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: GitOpsCon 2021
Description: 
	We will talk about our journey with fully automating Openshift multi-cluster installation on an on-prem air-gapped environment, in one of Israeli's largest banks - Bank Hapoalim.

We used ArgoCD, Ansible, and GitlabCI to transform our infrastructure into a single source of truth form. We will share how the GitOps methodology inspired cultural changes in our company.

We will show the hard-fought details of our implementation and the evolution of the automation process with GitOps.
