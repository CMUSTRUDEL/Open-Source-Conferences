Title: The GitOps Journey
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: GitOpsCon 2021
Description: 
	I will show why GitOps is a major waypoint in the journey from old-style Dev vs. Ops data center operations towards a truly automated hands-off operations future. GitOps is the technological core required for compliance automation, large-scale operations, and lowering the cost of compliance & governance as well as lowering the cost of internal tooling.

GitOps will give us a future, where we all take a step back, watch the bots do the admin job, and where we Dev, Ops, everybody work on improving the bots and invent new automation solutions.
