Title: GitOps as a means of distribution
Publication date: 2021-04-30
Playlist: GitOpsCon 2021
Description: 
	In GitOps we mostly talk about tooling. How you can set up the GitOps loop? How you can automate your deployments? How can you standardize your tooling and take it with you between projects? Argo or Flux?

What if we tell you that maybe not just the tooling what's worth sharing between projects?

In this talk, you will learn about two consultantsâ€™ experiences in applying GitOps at European companies, and their ideas on how to share not just the tooling, but the stacks defined in GitOps repos.

This talk is also a call to action to set up open-source reference stacks that equip your cluster with the typical cluster components. And use GitOps as a means of distribution.
