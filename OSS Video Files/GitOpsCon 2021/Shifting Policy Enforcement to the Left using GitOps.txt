Title: Shifting Policy Enforcement to the Left using GitOps
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: GitOpsCon 2021
Description: 
	Open Policy Agent’s Gatekeeper provides a policy-based approach to managing admission control and identifying policy violations, stopping bad things from happening to production deployments. But those checks only happen at deploy time - what if we could move that process back into the GitOps workflow?

In this session, we’ll review the basics of implementing policy controls using OPA Gatekeeper, and go in-depth on bringing those policy checks back into the branch-commit-merge process. We’ll demonstrate the different approaches to integrating OPA Gatekeeper with GitOps, bringing policy enforcement to the left and identifying policy violations much earlier.
