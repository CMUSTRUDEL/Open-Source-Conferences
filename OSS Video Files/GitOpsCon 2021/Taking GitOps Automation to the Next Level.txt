Title: Taking GitOps Automation to the Next Level
Publication date: 2021-04-29
Playlist: GitOpsCon 2021
Description: 
	We all know that GitOps can easily scale across hundreds of endpoints, but what about the ability for humans to scale to support many deployment files across multiple environments.  In this discussion, we will look to the future automation needs for scaling the human side of GitOps. Generation of .yaml files, separating the data from definition and the automation of pull request will be discussed as ways to take GitOps automation to the next level. Research from the Ortelius open-source community, a CDF incubating project, will be explored including what data is needed for auto-generating .yaml files, how to manage the metadata, and what is required to automate the pull request process as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
