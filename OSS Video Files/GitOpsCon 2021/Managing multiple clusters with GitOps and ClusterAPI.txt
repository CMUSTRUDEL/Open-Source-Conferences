Title: Managing multiple clusters with GitOps and ClusterAPI
Publication date: 2021-05-04
Playlist: GitOpsCon 2021
Description: 
	We will show how to create and manage the lifecycle of a cluster fleet in a GitOps way using native Kubernetes primitives and objects, utilizing a seed cluster to spin up a series of dedicated managed worker clusters to run our application of choice. Since we leverage the popular ArgoCD project, we can easily visualize the entire fleet thru the Argo UI. We will show how reconciliation works by enforcing both infrastructure and application desired state.
