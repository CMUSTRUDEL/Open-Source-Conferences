Description: 
	Today Machine learning can be seen in literally every aspect in life. Machine learning helps us make good decisions by learning from the existing data models and applying good predictions of the next output to give us suggestions and feedback over existing solutions.

The question arises about applying machine learning to GitOps! 
Can we use machine learning to GitOps so that we can increase the chances of improving the deployment accuracy and make predictions on which deployments are likely to fail and need more attention?

Is it possible to use machine learning to improve some of the existing quality metrics and drive for better deployment results? 

Can machine learning be used to improve the deployment validation processes?
