I'm here to talk about leveraging Drupal

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:10,560
contribs to make the admin process a

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,440
little easier I'm gonna start off real

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,910
quick go to the next night for me just a

00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,619
little bit about me I've been doing this

00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:19,500
you know development kind of stuff for

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,890
about 10 years and doing Drupal for four

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,490
or four more years now all the way 46 up

00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:29,460
to current and a lot of job titles and

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,020
had ten years web developer systems

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:35,690
architect I I'm actually currently a a

00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:38,039
partner at OS solutions part owner

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,210
during this a lot of this stuff that

00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:41,399
makes this a little bit quicker for us

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,960
we use Bluehost which is a real cheap

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,119
hosting environment if you ever want to

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,080
kick around Drupal kind of want to learn

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,130
a little bit of this stuff without

00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,390
having to pay a whole lot you can get

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:50,460
hosting it for like four bucks a month

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,290
they have simple scripts which gives you

00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:54,030
kind of like a one-click install Drupal

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,119
which will help you get to get off the

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:58,890
off the ground here josh is great we

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,170
actually give talks about drush itself a

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:04,020
lot of times I actually presented rush

00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,460
here last year devel which is another

00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,450
good one help me generate some test

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:10,769
content in a hurry before i go to the

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:12,660
next slide i'm gonna get kind of a gauge

00:02:10,769 --> 00:02:16,170
for the room how many people here are

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,110
relatively familiar with drupal okay it

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:21,030
looks like just about everybody out of

00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,820
that portion of people here how many you

00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:28,650
guys are developers anybody that's fine

00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,390
any of you guys admin sites kind of do

00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,190
contact management for them or those

00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,739
kind of things this talks to me mostly

00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,790
for you guys there's a few of these

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,110
modules that we're going to talk about

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,670
that are actually going to be helpful

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,590
for people like me that actually build

00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:43,320
the sites or spend time actually

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,930
developing the backends just to kind of

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,720
make things look a little bit nicer not

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,579
overwhelm you as a user trying to go in

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,830
and try to admin some content or just

00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:55,020
try to add some different things instead

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,069
of using the Drupal default stuff we're

00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,740
going to go ahead and use some of these

00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,780
contribs

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,550
that's out there to kind of make that a

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,870
little bit easier process most of this

00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,730
is going to geared toward rupal 6

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,320
because I've actually been using these

00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,170
modules for drupal 6 for quite some time

00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:09,490
a few of them are available in seven

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,740
some of these things are kind of no

00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:14,470
longer useful in seven because Drupal 7

00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,610
takes care of a lot of before yeah we

00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,870
can talk about that a little bit at the

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,970
end or if you have specific questions

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,360
let me know the first thing we're going

00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:24,850
to talk about and go ahead is

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,270
administration things a lot of people go

00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,120
ahead and just use the default darling

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,440
that will drive you nuts eventually the

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,900
first thing I got to say about that kind

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,910
of stuff is make sure that you always

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,280
always always use an administration

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,710
thing because otherwise you start making

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,510
CC our CSS changes and template changes

00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,240
on the front end that are meant to be

00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:47,680
for users say you're actually changed in

00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,540
your same theme that using for all your

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,520
admin that's going to drive you insane

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,470
down the road there's a lot of these

00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:54,940
kind of admin themes out there that are

00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,680
actually designed just to be an

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,180
administration theme they're not meant

00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,820
to be a front end they're not meant to

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:04,240
be seen by the general public those kind

00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:06,880
of things root candy 7 oddly enough is

00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:10,210
the admins being 47 they've got to

00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:12,910
backport 46 you'll see that in the modal

00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:15,310
popup since seven now you know there's

00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,120
there's a long list of them we're going

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,510
to go ahead and we're going to talk

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,820
about rubik on to the next slide rubix

00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,560
you'll see that on all these slides I'm

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:25,870
basically going to give you the project

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,220
page and I'm going to give you a you

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,680
know the little synapses that they have

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,060
on the page right from the developer

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,110
some of these will make sense

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,200
something's want but we'll talk about

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:39,460
them so if you can go ahead and pull up

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:42,730
the the demo site that we rolled just

00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,040
for today this is kind of default

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:46,750
durable it's using the garland theme in

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,210
front and the garland theme on the admin

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,470
end right now i just used evolved and

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,240
generate a bunch of content so you can

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:56,680
actually see some of this stuff in use

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,900
you wanna go / admin for me so here he

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,590
hears your admin section using Garland

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:04,120
it's a bit crowded it's it's not

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,610
designed to be an administrative theme

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,260
it gets to the point where you get a

00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,729
little confused evil loss and obviously

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,199
like I said if you start

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:12,819
and templates and things like that for

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,529
your front end display you're going to

00:05:12,819 --> 00:05:16,210
be changing these same templates over

00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:17,740
here so what we're going to do is we're

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,870
going to able rubix which is just an

00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:21,909
admin theme open publish uses it which

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:25,539
is a relatively large drupal install

00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:26,889
profile they're used open publishes

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:30,969
mainly used for sites that do

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:34,419
publication we've actually myself and

00:05:30,969 --> 00:05:37,270
steven here who's my assistant is well

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:40,059
sis thing here business partner let me

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,069
clear that out real quick we actually

00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:44,649
got our start kind of in the published

00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:46,059
publishing business and working for some

00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:47,529
newspapers and things like that so we

00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,330
came across open publish and took a

00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:51,249
liking to it so just kind of like the

00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,490
theme for it you'll go ahead and go to

00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:55,749
the admin theme and in Drupal 6 by

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,460
default you had a little part down here

00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:59,199
says administration theme that didn't

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,020
used to be there but that's that's kind

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,460
of a newer thing in six and we're going

00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,110
to go ahead and instead of using system

00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:09,210
fault which is a no no we're going to

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:12,039
pick rubix here and we're also going to

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,129
click the use admin for content entity

00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:16,569
because once again CSS adjustments

00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:18,490
template adjustments that were meant to

00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:19,959
display are not necessarily the best

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:22,060
things for when you're going to the edit

00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:23,319
pages on different nodes it'll drive you

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,969
nuts you don't want to have to start

00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,159
putting a conditional CSS for different

00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:30,569
things so now you'll say we got a much

00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:32,529
cleaner looking little little interface

00:06:30,569 --> 00:06:34,060
everything's kind of Road out a little

00:06:32,529 --> 00:06:35,830
bit you gotta if you scroll back up a

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,069
little bit you've got all these nice

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,870
little icons that the theme developer

00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:43,689
cuff brought in for you so kind of gives

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:46,419
you a visual cue as to what you're

00:06:43,689 --> 00:06:48,159
actually doing this will make things a

00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:50,319
lot easier this is designed to be an

00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:51,699
admin theme so all these kind of things

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,110
are taken care of for you and if you do

00:06:51,699 --> 00:06:54,759
need to make some changes you do need to

00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,839
make template changes do you make CSS

00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,259
changes you can make them here and

00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:01,629
that'll only affect this section when

00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:04,539
you're an admin only as an privileged

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:09,699
user go ahead back to the slides there

00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:13,389
for a second the next thing we're going

00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:14,649
to talk about is a kind of kind of a

00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:17,379
module that we use in conjunction with

00:07:14,649 --> 00:07:19,689
us it's called the admin module this

00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:21,409
gives you a list of you know gives you a

00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,229
menu that basically let you go

00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:26,119
a lot of the admin section without

00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:28,580
having to go to that / admin page every

00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:30,409
time that loads all that stuff right go

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,339
back over and enable that for me if you

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,419
wouldn't mind so there's there's a few

00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:36,949
of these kind of modules out there

00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:38,599
there's one that's called admin menu a

00:07:36,949 --> 00:07:40,819
lot of people like that if you likes a

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,439
little a little black bar at the top

00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:44,119
that gives you all the drop-down menus

00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,319
and all that the problem that we come

00:07:44,119 --> 00:07:48,259
across because we work on a lot of

00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:49,729
larger sites that have banner images

00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,569
have all these kind of things that are

00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:54,709
high you know high scalability stuff I I

00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,389
publicity kind of stuff you end up

00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:58,099
having to do a lot of templating a lot

00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:59,689
of CFS adjustments and feenin on the

00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:01,939
front end and that kind of gets in the

00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,169
wake for it so you don't want to you

00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,719
know be trying to get two different

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:07,699
different aspects of the page and have

00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:10,429
this admin menu sitting in the way so we

00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:11,419
use this admin module here this just

00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,610
gives you a nice little wrench in the

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:16,399
corner kind of let's hide away when you

00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,679
don't want to use it and it kind of

00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,479
takes all that interference with your

00:08:18,679 --> 00:08:22,339
theme out of the way for it just gives

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,749
you a nice little little menu that just

00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:25,490
gets you to all the different places on

00:08:23,749 --> 00:08:27,709
the site all the stuff on the backend

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:30,649
you don't have to go to you know go to

00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:31,819
the / admin and then go two blocks and

00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:34,849
all that you can actually just go there

00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:35,959
directly from here this will make this

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:38,300
will make users life a lot easier

00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,430
because obviously Drupal as a whole is

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,490
all permission based in role-based if

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:45,410
your role doesn't have have access to a

00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:47,120
particular link and you're logged in

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,560
even though you have the admin module it

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
just won't render that link for you

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,649
because it's not something that you have

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,589
access to so then I'll stay a lot

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,600
cleaner the the ad like the super user

00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:58,009
admin sometimes get a little crowded

00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,480
over here because you have a lot of

00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:00,790
different modules enabled you have a lot

00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,529
of different permissions as it as a

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,350
privileged user but I said if you're

00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:08,750
going into a publishing company like

00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,529
we've come from and you have you know

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:14,269
content editors you have you know actual

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,100
site editors those kind of things where

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,170
you may have different privileges for

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,870
different roles this is real nice

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:22,100
because if you don't have privileges to

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,930
any of these things just going to go

00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,550
away so you have a real nice clean

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,259
little interface it just gives you just

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,899
the links that you can use and like I

00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,250
said once you close that it'll just take

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,990
it right out of the way for you puts it

00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,040
up a little up corn can hit the clothes

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,090
that for just second

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,350
then I'll just pull that away and that

00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:39,550
doesn't interfere with your theme it

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,530
makes it a little bit nicer you can

00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:44,110
actually browse the site you want to go

00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:45,340
back to the homepage for your second now

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,490
you'll notice we didn't change the front

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,840
end still ugly Garland and but you still

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,860
have your little wrench in the corner so

00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,570
that means you can browse through each

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,880
light you're still going to have quick

00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,350
access to all your admin tools all the

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,320
little things that you might be able to

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:03,850
do and it won't kind of get in the way

00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,490
for it no they don't basically what

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,680
happens well let me take the question

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:11,520
actually was well anonymous users see

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,870
this this branch that's actually

00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,520
controlled in the permissions you can

00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:18,430
actually say if you can who can see the

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:20,140
admin the admin module obviously if they

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:22,000
see the admin module but they have no

00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,950
permissions anything else they're not

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,390
going to get anything you can turn the

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,790
songs for just certain roles you know

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,140
you may have people that are just you

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,340
know fact checkers or those kind of

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,240
things so they don't actually need any

00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:33,670
of this they're just going to read

00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:36,600
through so you can take that away go

00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,600
ahead and go back to slice coin

00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:44,029
block at it this is another one that's

00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:46,249
real nice instead of having to go

00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,199
through go to your admin area and go to

00:10:46,249 --> 00:10:49,699
admin build and go to your blocks page

00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:51,619
and they have to go to find the block

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:53,389
that you're looking for which if you're

00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:55,459
on a large site you have you know let's

00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:57,829
say dozens or hundreds of blocks which

00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:59,389
actually happens quite a quite often

00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:00,739
instead of having to search through all

00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:03,919
those and try to figure out you know

00:11:00,739 --> 00:11:05,119
what was that block named because not

00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,160
everybody uses real good naming

00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:08,419
conventions what what it says on the top

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,609
of the block isn't always what the

00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:12,559
blocks actual title is or what is the

00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:14,749
configuration and is this will actually

00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,879
give you a nice little visual cue once

00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:19,040
again handle by permissions that once

00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,959
enabled you can go to a block any block

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,609
on your on your site and as you hover

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,980
over if you have the correct permission

00:11:22,609 --> 00:11:26,809
it'll give you a direct link to the

00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:29,359
configure for that particular block if

00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,949
you use that you get to skip all those

00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:34,100
intermediate pages it's a real

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:35,329
time-saver obviously like said because

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,499
it's permission-based you're not going

00:11:35,329 --> 00:11:37,779
to have problems with other people

00:11:36,499 --> 00:11:40,309
getting into it that aren't supposed to

00:11:37,779 --> 00:11:42,459
but it also gives you a real direct

00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:44,869
route of people that may not actually be

00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,339
developers of the site but they may need

00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:48,199
to change some of the content a block

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,819
maybe it's just some wording or

00:11:48,199 --> 00:11:51,769
something like that and they don't want

00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:54,019
to say you know put in a ticket to go

00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,220
okay well how do I get to this to find

00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,619
out how to do or and you don't want to

00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,509
give them all the you want to train them

00:11:57,619 --> 00:12:00,649
on how to navigate the back end side of

00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:02,629
it you just want to let them have a

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:07,369
configuration link you want to go ahead

00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:09,850
over to the site and I think we have to

00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:09,850
enable it

00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:34,180
block of the links is on okay so you can

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:37,540
go back to the front page there and go

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:39,040
ahead and close your and if you go ahead

00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,990
and mouse over that you'll see you have

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,880
a nice little configure like they're so

00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,890
instead of navigating on the back end to

00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,900
find that basically click right there on

00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:48,880
that link you're going to go ahead and

00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,560
you want to change the body say hello

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,210
world bang I don't know go ahead and

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,090
save because Drupal does save your

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,140
destination where you're originally from

00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,970
take you right back to our once and see

00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,020
we've made that change in literally

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,760
seconds instead of having to go back

00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,960
through the admin said I haven't have

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,870
somebody put a ticket and go ahead and

00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:17,470
make this change let's go back to the

00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:20,470
slides context now context is a much

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:23,290
cleaner way a much more controllable way

00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:25,450
of admitting blocked the old way of

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,580
doing blocks was that you went to your

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:30,040
admin you're a headman bill block page

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,110
and you just started assigning blocks to

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,960
regions and then within that you start

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,750
going and you want to go back and click

00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:39,070
on one of those blocks or just second

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,550
you might want to set visibility you

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:45,010
know this block only shows up on article

00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:46,420
pages or on you know blog posts are

00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:49,330
those kind of things so instead of

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:50,980
putting page specific saying okay well

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,270
everything's got to be / blog or

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,290
whatever you may not have that name if

00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:54,640
you mention your padding may be

00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:57,100
different those kind of things you want

00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,710
to have some kind of some kind of logic

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:01,900
in place to say okay well if it's this

00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:04,330
content type or I want a site-wide

00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:07,420
context those kind of things you can do

00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:10,030
that using the context module which will

00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:11,800
allow you to go into a specific context

00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,200
that you set up say you set aside a

00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,210
site-wide context if you go into edit

00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,790
that particular context you know that

00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:21,040
that is for all the pages on the site

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:22,810
because it's a site-wide context if you

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,510
make a context that is only applicable

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,710
on the page content type you can go in

00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:28,900
there and change the blocks that are

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,760
just on the page content type you can

00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,740
use different PHP conditions those kind

00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,320
of things that will say you know if a

00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:37,210
user is of this role if they

00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,830
are from this city you know in their

00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,380
profile those kind of things then show

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,590
these kind of blocks you could have a

00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,930
you see tools are you could have all

00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,390
sorts of you know conditions in context

00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:51,120
that'll that'll save you a whole lot of

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,200
time instead of going to your admin bill

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,730
because once again if you start getting

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,490
to a large-scale site where you have

00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,220
dozens or hundreds of blocks you may

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:02,650
have 30 blocks that are in the right

00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,030
rail but they only show on different

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,980
sets of pages and those kind of things

00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:09,580
this makes it a much cleaner interface

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,480
for it you know I can get that enabled

00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:14,860
for right now and like that also gives

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,330
you a lot more control over to wear

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:18,940
these things show up instead of just

00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:20,500
giving you what pages it shows up on or

00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,110
what pages it doesn't show up on and

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,500
gives you you know gives your use some

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,610
PHP access to do those kind of things

00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,590
we're going to go ahead and enable this

00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,540
and I'm right now i'm currently using

00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:35,890
the admin building to put that to put

00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:38,320
that block that was on the front page in

00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:40,480
the right rail will go ahead and now

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,370
that we have you'll see we've got my

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,230
block on the right sidebar so now if we

00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:46,620
go now that context is enabled you can

00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:49,000
go ahead and set that to none right now

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:51,400
because we we can actually go away from

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,320
using this this interface completely we

00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:58,710
don't have to use this at all now that

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,710
will be gone

00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:17,540
a little technical difficulty there

00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:22,000
looks like didn't quite enable or

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,000
something something along those lines

00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:38,990
well I'm going to clear cache or

00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:38,990
something

00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:45,799
what you see him doing here is just some

00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:48,499
drunk commands really useful for

00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,720
developers especially you can run you

00:16:48,499 --> 00:16:52,790
know you can clear caches you can get

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,470
into your sequel command line you can do

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:56,660
a lot of kind of kind of neat stuff from

00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:58,009
there generate content those kind of

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,040
things without ever having to come to

00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:03,319
the interface downloader naval modules

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,409
instead of actually going to going to

00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:09,100
drupal.org going finding a module

00:17:05,409 --> 00:17:11,480
downloading it ftp ended up going in

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,130
extracting it there go ahead and go into

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,799
the modules page and enable in it you

00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,350
literally type drush download name of

00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,579
the module and then drush enable name of

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,589
the module and it's taken care for it

00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:22,429
you don't have to go into this at all so

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,019
we're going to go ahead and add a

00:17:22,429 --> 00:17:31,159
context real quick see if we can't add

00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:33,399
one just for the front page yeah just do

00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:33,399
path

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,060
so we're doing now is we're actually

00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,290
making a context for the plug where

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:41,430
we're going to say these are the blocks

00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,410
that show up on the front page and

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:45,060
that's it that way when we go ahead and

00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:46,380
place this block will have this block

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,970
show up in the right rail on just the

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,370
front page you may have this for a

00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:52,080
number of reasons you may have ads that

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,870
show up on specific pages you may have

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:57,030
you know blocks of blocks of content

00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:00,420
like a weather block or you know social

00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:02,070
media links those kind of things this

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:03,540
gives you that kind of access and this

00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:05,310
way once we do this when we add this to

00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,390
the front page context we'll go ahead

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:08,940
and we'll show it to you on the front

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,560
page and then we'll go to an interior

00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:16,440
page and you'll see that that that block

00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:18,000
is gone the other nice part about this

00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,000
is that if you have if you're using the

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,410
admin build and you have let's say the

00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,150
same thing you have a social networking

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,890
block that you want to show but you want

00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:27,930
to show on the Left rail in certain

00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:29,790
times or the right rail on others that's

00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:30,750
very difficult to do you use them Edmond

00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,400
bill block because you're basically

00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,380
telling it I'm you're either a right

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,200
rail block or your left rail block or

00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,150
your content block or whatever by doing

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,130
this with context for each one of these

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,180
contexts that happens you get to reset

00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:45,240
that you could start all over again

00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,890
you'd say okay well I want you know on

00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,450
article pages on with the social network

00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:49,950
the thing to be on the right rail on the

00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:52,670
front page I want to be on the left you

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,670
can do that this way

00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:08,890
so you'll see that we got it on the

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,040
front page again still there yeah we'll

00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:39,100
just click on any one of these little

00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:41,830
generated pieces of content yes yep yeah

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,110
gentleman makes a real good point the

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,580
sorting order that's on a on the edmund

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:48,370
build blocks page is actually determined

00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,440
by the by the weight but it's not

00:19:48,370 --> 00:19:52,390
displayed so you can drag those things

00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,950
up and down using the little you wat it

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,290
gets really confusing when you start

00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:58,720
having a number of blocks I've worked on

00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,550
sites like Jacksonville com which is the

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,650
Florida times-union site they literally

00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,840
probably have 400 different blocks and

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:07,030
at the time that I was working there

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,790
they didn't use context they use the

00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:11,740
actual blocks they use the admin but

00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:13,000
bill block page and they use panels to

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,800
control those kind of things that was

00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,990
their work around which is really

00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:19,720
inefficient as far as large-scale kind

00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:23,770
of sight you're talking places like

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,510
Jacksonville com Miami Dolphins the NCAA

00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:28,180
com like large sites like this that

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,610
we've worked on scalability is really a

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,470
big problem you want to make sure that

00:20:30,610 --> 00:20:34,390
you keep as little overhead as possible

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,770
so you use these kind of things use

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,810
feature some other kind of things to

00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:40,420
make these these blocks only have to be

00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:41,800
rendered on certain context it really

00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,640
helps with scalability and it really

00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:48,010
helps sanity levels of of the everyday

00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,630
you know content entry person that's

00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:51,280
just trying to get their job done

00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,760
instead of them having to sort through

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,070
things or worse yet put in a help ticket

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,900
and kind of spend your time spend you

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:00,670
know the sports time to kind of you know

00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,990
move that map that over to it this

00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:04,360
allows them to get to this a whole lot

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:07,180
easier and a whole lot less confusing

00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,520
for for the user and for the developer

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,680
because on some sites you may not be the

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,750
original developer you may be somebody

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,790
coming in and you don't know what

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:16,710
they're naming convention was you don't

00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,750
know what

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,130
modules they have in place you know we

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:22,020
don't you don't know how they're making

00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:23,399
this thing these things happen if you

00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,679
use context it's a little bit more of a

00:21:23,399 --> 00:21:29,340
standard it's nice easy interface to

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:33,860
look at really helps kind of streamline

00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:33,860
that process go ahead and go back to the

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,510
yep all right the next one I'm going to

00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,830
talk about its taxonomy manager this is

00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:44,730
one of my favorite ones how many people

00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:46,289
here are familiar with taxonomy okay for

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:49,049
those of you aren't taxonomy is

00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:51,620
basically a interesting way of saying

00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:55,309
tagging you've seen tag clouds online

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,270
it's basically you tagging some content

00:21:55,309 --> 00:21:58,799
taxonomy is a little bit more in depth

00:21:57,270 --> 00:22:00,480
there you can set different content

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,240
types you know different things here and

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,620
there the problem with taxonomy the

00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,899
built-in taxonomy that's built into

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:10,580
Drupal 6 is that you want to go ahead

00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:12,750
and go to the admin just taxonomy page

00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:15,720
is that when you want to go ahead and

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:19,429
enter a taxonomy term you literally go

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,480
I've added one go ahead and do add term

00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:24,299
we're going to add a term to this

00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:26,880
vocabulary literally for us to do this

00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:30,630
we have to do this page for every single

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,880
term and that's fine unless you have 500

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,549
terms and if you don't want to go

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:39,149
through this this set of 3 pages 500

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,320
times you might want to look into look

00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,370
into something else here so we're going

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,860
to go ahead and he's going to save this

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,230
you have this term we're to go now we're

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:48,330
gonna go up to text on the manager

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:50,580
instead here's all of our vocabularies

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:56,880
we're going to pick one and we're going

00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:59,820
to say okay we want to go ad now I can

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,529
put a whole bunch or if I really have a

00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:05,490
lot of them say I have two or three

00:23:01,529 --> 00:23:07,260
hundred there is also a tech a mass term

00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:09,720
import with a text area under there

00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:12,899
where you can literally just open it up

00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:17,159
and slap in a hundred terms 200 terms

00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:23,279
whatever i'm not sure if we do both at

00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:26,429
the same time will give a shot yep there

00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,049
they are that quick just done the other

00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:30,090
nice part about this is you have you can

00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:31,470
do exports you can be merges

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:32,520
the doubletree is really nice you want

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:35,730
to go ahead and click on doubletree for

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:39,659
me what doubletree yep just enable

00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:41,130
doubletree is lets you kind of have you

00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:43,169
may want to move a taxonomy term from

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,659
one vocabulary to another or you may say

00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:48,360
okay I actually want these say i want

00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:50,730
manager to be under my term you can

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:52,770
actually click manager and click my term

00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:56,520
and drag it underneath it making a sub

00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:58,679
term just that quick really useful if

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,120
you have a bunch of these you want you

00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:02,909
know you have somebody if your client

00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,010
gave you you know or your boss gave you

00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:06,690
500 terms and he just gave them to you

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:09,450
in a text document it says here you know

00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:11,130
and then a week later they said well you

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,779
know these terms or child's of these

00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:14,669
terms I need to go back and change all

00:24:12,779 --> 00:24:18,090
that if you use the built-in taxonomy

00:24:14,669 --> 00:24:20,010
that's real real complicated with this

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,510
you can just start you know selecting

00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:22,799
them and dragging them underneath move

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,289
them all around make a whole bunch of

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,549
changes at one time and a really really

00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:31,529
cut down the amount of time it takes you

00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:33,210
to kind of add these tags really really

00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:36,029
big favorite of mine because almost

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:39,649
every every large-scale site is going to

00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:39,649
use taxonomy and some form yes

00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:05,040
the question was can taxonomy manager

00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,580
also be used to kind of manage the terms

00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,400
and so he brought up the specific case

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:14,220
of you know people wanting to put in

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,830
free tags where they say maybe snake or

00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,750
snakes or South Carolina or SC by the

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,640
way that is the that's the devil don't

00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:23,130
ever let them have free tags give them

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,590
choices don't let anybody will help

00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:29,160
people put stuff in a camel case people

00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:33,060
put stuff in misspelled it'll it'll

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,400
really be a nightmare for him oh I'm

00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:38,280
sure you do it we work for the newspaper

00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,500
and a lot for a portion of time they

00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,690
were letting people freitag stories and

00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,580
well one that kind of gives them the

00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,040
ability to put in some not very nice

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,900
terms which are not nice either because

00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:52,230
that all of a sudden gets indexed by

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:55,830
Google and yeah yours Jacksonville com

00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,880
on top of Google for some arbitrary set

00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,470
of words that you don't want to be

00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,490
associated with but yeah you can use

00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,080
them here you can delete different

00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:03,330
things here if you actually click on the

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,850
term that'll take you to the term page

00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:07,470
the go ahead click on them where you can

00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,880
set right here you can set synonyms

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:11,060
relations parents all those kind of

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,920
things all that functionalities here

00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,660
it's almost insanity to not use taxonomy

00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:18,930
manager especially if you're on a site

00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,540
that has any size any kind of any kind

00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:22,980
of user base it's going to be it's going

00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:25,350
to drive you not Steve's anything about

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:34,200
this so go ahead and move on to the next

00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:37,110
one wrinkle tabs yay so you want to go

00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,960
into edit a note for me basically when

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:42,540
you go to a note at it and these ones

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:44,370
won't be quite as crazy but you'll

00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,990
notice at the bottom here I've already

00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:47,280
got it enabled see how you have all

00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,010
these things kind of set in these

00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,850
vertical tabs right you want to go ahead

00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:54,900
and disable vertical petrol I'm talking

00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:56,250
what that does is that gives you that

00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,540
interface like that and I'll stack all

00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,480
that stuff for you instead of this

00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:02,870
having this really long page your add

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,150
edit page that just goes on forever

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,680
this kind of puts that stuff and

00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:08,480
combines it into those little vertical

00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,630
tabs on the side which allows you to

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,520
kind of interact with it right there it

00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,750
doesn't look so bad in a default Drupal

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,640
install like this but once you start

00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,120
adding some other modules like content

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,860
profile and you start using node

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,780
relations and all these other kind of

00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,830
things they keep adding little things at

00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,840
the bottom here see how we have

00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:28,730
authoring information now and we have

00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,170
revision information and this would

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,720
actually look much worse than we not use

00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:34,850
an admin theme because rubix is smart

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,140
enough to collapse these things by

00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:38,600
default for a so it doesn't give you

00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,440
this overwhelming page to look at it's

00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:44,780
just edited out when we turn that

00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,790
vertical tabs back on you'll see that

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:48,470
stuff kind of all classes for it it

00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,540
gives you a much nicer cleaner interface

00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,910
it kind of hides all that stuff for you

00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:55,970
if you're not really looking for it it's

00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:57,380
still there it just makes the makes the

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,050
person that's working on the site that's

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,940
not a developer that's not a manager

00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:04,670
there that just needs to go in and says

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,020
say I need to look at the revision

00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:07,850
information you literally got it right

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,740
there and does a nice little load over

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:12,280
there on the side for you once again

00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:14,929
another thing just a streamlined look

00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,929
streamlined feel streamlined the amount

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:20,540
of time you spend on the site you know

00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:23,179
time is money and we all all don't want

00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:26,300
us you know has all over these are our

00:28:23,179 --> 00:28:28,610
co-workers or our employees or for that

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,830
matter we don't want to have our clients

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,870
getting overwhelmed by the system we

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,580
want them to enjoy Drupal as a whole and

00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,530
these kind of things make this a little

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,809
bit nicer form makes the user experience

00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:40,160
a little bit nicer and makes the chances

00:28:38,809 --> 00:28:41,840
of you get another you know either

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,820
another contract with them or keeping

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:53,690
your job they're using Drupal a little

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:56,450
bit more likely filter perms okay so has

00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:58,640
anybody here other than myself worked on

00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:04,280
any larger scale kind of drupal

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:05,780
implementations great you'll if you

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,830
worked on larger ones you'll notice

00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,630
especially if you use content

00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:11,929
construction kit and you turn on the

00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:13,940
content permissions where each field has

00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,870
its own set of permissions and you may

00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:18,640
have maybe have three or four or five

00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:21,910
or 10 different different roles on the

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,530
site and you have 25 different content

00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:25,780
types and they all have their own fields

00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,250
and maybe your developer didn't think

00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:28,750
far enough ahead to reuse the same

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,030
fields on a lot of these different ones

00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:33,280
so every content type has its own image

00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:36,100
field you'll start seeing the

00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:38,920
permissions a really really long set

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,890
permissions you want to go to the admin

00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:45,190
permissions work this module will let

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,720
you kind of consolidate a lot of that

00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,790
stuff and we're actually going to use

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,350
this it gives you this hair permission

00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:51,760
filters it'll let you permission or

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,890
filter by just the role that you're

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,600
looking at because as you start to get

00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,580
really really large we have a lot of

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,890
roles you kind of get cross-eyed and

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,320
look at it going ok I need to follow

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,360
across where this one is for this

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:06,280
particular role this lets you only show

00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:07,720
the stuff you want say we only want to

00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,700
show stuff for an honest or me you only

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,320
want to say I only want to look at the

00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,490
block permissions and I want to look in

00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,320
it for all the rules or I want to look

00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:16,690
at it for a particular role those kind

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,460
of things we're going to go ahead and

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,559
see a much smaller list now that's a

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,660
whole lot less overwhelming than that

00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,600
really really large list of stuff that

00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:27,040
was there once again just going to make

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,510
your life a lot easier as an admin

00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,490
you're not going to have to filter

00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:32,590
through three thousand permission sets

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,809
in order to say okay I just wanted to

00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:36,910
update you know I wanted to update the

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:38,679
content managers ability to see this one

00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,330
particular field instead of loan that

00:30:38,679 --> 00:30:42,880
entire thing and trying to look through

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,400
it you know doing us doing a search for

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,400
the term that may not be what it's

00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,200
called because modules are contributed

00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,510
by third parties they're there by the

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,850
community we contribute modules anybody

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,220
in this room German a module your naming

00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:00,630
convention may not be a sane naming

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:03,280
convention you may have a module cold

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,400
block admin but you're actually calling

00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,540
it administration block in here so what

00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,250
you're looking for or what it's actually

00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:11,110
called may not be the same thing this

00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:13,270
lets you say okay I know what module it

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:18,640
was BAM only show the permissions for

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:21,460
that particular module check heavy you I

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,830
this goes and goes with that needs to be

00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:27,450
enabled for me as well this goes along

00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,980
with that permissions so say you have

00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,820
ten rolls again and you have three

00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:33,850
thousand permission

00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:38,620
and you need to make you need to give a

00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:41,259
role of I don't know developer every

00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,630
single permission except three of them

00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:47,110
so instead of checking a thousand

00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,000
permissions minus three so 997

00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,730
permissions you can use check heavy you

00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,850
I go back to that same it's that same

00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:56,620
permissions page and there will be a

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,509
nice little little check box at the top

00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,279
that'll basically check all that in that

00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:02,200
column for you so you'll have all

00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,149
thousands and able to begin with now I

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,490
go ahead and disable the three things I

00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:07,809
didn't want them to have it gets to be

00:32:06,490 --> 00:32:09,190
really crazy you can see already how

00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:11,590
many permissions we have and this is a

00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,840
very default site I rolled this site

00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,210
this morning so you can see how this

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:22,210
gets to be overwhelming I don't know

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:23,379
that didn't seem to take sometimes we

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:24,580
have to clear cache and some other

00:32:23,379 --> 00:32:27,370
things to get these things to kind of

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,779
show up if it doesn't show up once again

00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:31,210
it's just a little check box at the top

00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:33,070
of each one of those there's actually an

00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,960
admin area for this particular module

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:37,090
that lets you have some other places

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,769
like you may have content types that

00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:40,539
have a lot of check fields and those

00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:43,240
kind of things to this will enable you

00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:46,950
to put that on there as well see how

00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:49,539
that shows up yeah no good all right

00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:51,370
trust me it works and just have a little

00:32:49,539 --> 00:32:56,950
problem with this one so I'm going to

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:58,299
keep moving use bulk operations this one

00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,529
we're actually going to demo for it i'm

00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:00,970
just going to talk about it a little bit

00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:02,830
because this site doesn't have nearly

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:06,279
enough content to really show you how

00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:08,200
how powerful it is you need to have use

00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:10,509
installed in order to use it but say you

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,399
go here admin content node which is

00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:13,779
where you're going to you know you're

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:15,100
gonna go to admin just click on content

00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:17,230
that's where all your content shown if

00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,639
you want to you know use all these nice

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,909
little filters and stuff that we have in

00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:24,549
here now where we we pick out a group of

00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:26,230
nodes or something like that well you're

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:29,639
only actually it when you go ahead and

00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:32,100
select the title here you're you're only

00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:35,289
selecting the ones that are being shown

00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:37,059
drupal paginate there may be a hundred

00:33:35,289 --> 00:33:38,679
thousand more of these that match the

00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:42,760
same criteria that you just you just

00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,019
talked about but they're not going to be

00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,890
selected because you're literally just

00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:47,200
selecting what's on the

00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:49,300
use both operations allows you to check

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,180
this it'll give you a nice little pop-up

00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,580
right here that says check you know

00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:56,020
select the 3,000 other nodes that also

00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:57,880
meet this criteria and if you do that

00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,980
then you can actually pick any of these

00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,260
update options at that point and select

00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:03,850
that for all all the matching nodes as

00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,590
opposed to just the ones you're seeing

00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,740
on the page so they having to go through

00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:10,120
page by page by page very useful like

00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:12,429
said the site doesn't have nearly enough

00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,890
content to really show you how well it

00:34:12,429 --> 00:34:16,810
works but trust me you get into large

00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:20,679
publication site to get in large new

00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:23,169
sites large-scale sites you're going to

00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:24,370
really really want a usable use bulk

00:34:23,169 --> 00:34:26,230
operations even if you have your own

00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,419
site and you're just using this for a

00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,179
blog or something like that you know a

00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:32,710
year from now you may have 300 blog post

00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:34,630
well you don't want to you know you

00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,510
don't want to go through 60 pages of

00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:38,620
that at2020 nodes per page views bulk

00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:46,390
operations going to allow you to select

00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:48,310
all those things at once em enroll now

00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:52,320
this gets back to what we were just

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:55,600
talking about where okay there's 3,000

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,150
3,000 permissions on this site I need to

00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,060
have a role that is basically the

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:03,370
developer or an admin a super user by

00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:05,790
default Drupal has one of those it's the

00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:08,560
user one account usually called admin

00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:11,200
you may have a team of two or you may

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,060
have a team of 20 or 200 and they need

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,550
to have all the access to everything to

00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,950
be a developer instead of making your

00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,810
own role in every single time you enable

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,310
something going back to this permissions

00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:24,760
page and making sure they have all those

00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,740
permissions you can use admin role which

00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,500
will basically when it's enabled which

00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:34,420
already is it'll go go to admin from

00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:36,070
under users it'll automatically make a

00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,470
role for it called administrator and

00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,860
it'll set all your all your privileges

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:43,210
to it so every time you go back to that

00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,800
permissions page or I think if you go to

00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,600
the blocks page as well it automatically

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,060
rebuilds those permissions so if you've

00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,760
enabled something new you've you know

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,530
upgraded a module and it's changed as

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,970
permission set instead of having to go

00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:57,250
through their manually update those

00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:58,430
permissions for the users it'll

00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,380
basically do that for you

00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:03,200
single time so you'll have a super user

00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:05,750
role as opposed to a super user account

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,339
this this helps immensely when you have

00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:09,440
a number of people work on your site and

00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:11,329
you're using watchdog logs or any of

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,550
these other things to find out you know

00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:16,579
who went and made this change on this

00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:19,940
page well if you're given everybody the

00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:21,619
admin account you have no idea there are

00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,420
some very large companies that you'd be

00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:25,520
surprised to hear their names that still

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,589
do it that way everybody has the user

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,290
one account they have admin and they

00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:32,869
have a universal password that all the

00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:35,540
developers share that takes away all

00:36:32,869 --> 00:36:37,400
accounting you don't know what user you

00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,559
take away all the all the built-in

00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,660
tracking that Drupal has you take that

00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:44,390
all away by doing that don't ever share

00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:46,520
passwords make sure you use use them in

00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:48,470
straight rows make sure everybody has

00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,329
their own account this is going to make

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:52,309
not necessarily pointing the finger at

00:36:50,329 --> 00:36:54,559
somebody easier this is going to be a

00:36:52,309 --> 00:36:56,359
make going to somebody to find out how

00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:58,849
we fix what just got broke a little bit

00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:00,980
easier you know I see you turned off

00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:03,079
this module and it broke all this

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,119
functionality well said of me just

00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,670
saying oh well user one did it I better

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,589
re-enable it and then you know my

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,140
coworker may not be in the same building

00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:15,260
he may not be in the same state timezone

00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:18,710
country of me may be working in you know

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:21,230
India and he's up at midnight my time he

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:22,640
goes back in and sees out this month I

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,990
thought I'd disabled this module its

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,280
back on I better go turn it back off

00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:27,920
next day you got the same problem all

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,170
over again this way you can go oh you

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,000
know Joe turned off this module let me

00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,460
find out why Joe turned off this module

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,109
find out what was causing him issues and

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,790
find out how we can rectify that so that

00:37:36,109 --> 00:37:39,859
way we're not just disabling something

00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:42,099
or enabling something that everybody

00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:44,809
else doesn't need and it'll help you

00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:47,920
help you get past that a lot quicker and

00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,920
track down those issues but

00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:03,240
so next one contenttype our video this

00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:05,220
is nice for if you have multiple content

00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,460
types on a site by default Drupal 6

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,740
gives you page and gives you story you

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,630
can enable blog few other things if you

00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:15,150
want to go to content types there's

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:17,040
going to be a new little tab there this

00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:19,380
will give you one place instead of

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,910
having to actually click into H content

00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,320
type to look at all the settings for

00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:23,940
each content type this basically give

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,260
you a little overview in the upper

00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,510
right-hand corner this will basically

00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,180
give you a nice little overview of

00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:31,950
everything you know what default option

00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:34,710
workflow options you have like you'll

00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:38,010
notice right here page is not promoted

00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:39,630
by default but story is you may have

00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:40,920
different settings for comments those

00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:42,630
kind of things you might say well I need

00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,940
to do an audit on the site to find out

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,980
you know I need to know what content

00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:48,630
types have from you have the comments

00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,100
turned on how many comments are showing

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,380
per page you can make all these changes

00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,750
at one time instead of having to go

00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,030
piece by piece by piece and walk through

00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,500
each content type you know keep yourself

00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:00,270
a little spreadsheet and start kicking

00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,160
things off as you went through them you

00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:12,690
can literally just as a line item know

00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:14,880
each one right here the the question on

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,190
this one was how does this paginate in

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,230
the honest-to-goodness answers I don't

00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,880
know I've never had enough content I've

00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:24,540
never used this on a site large enough

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,640
to have enough enough content types that

00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:28,050
doesn't show I've gotten to the point

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,180
where it starts to scroll to the right

00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,530
quite aways I'm assuming that that's the

00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,850
way it's going to continue to work but

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,930
that's obviously just an assumption by

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,120
me I haven't actually looked at the code

00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,220
for this particular module most modules

00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:39,930
that I use i'll try to take a look at

00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,990
the code first just to get an idea of

00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:44,330
what's going on and also for another

00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:46,710
module going to talk about a minute

00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,900
module info a lot of times you'll

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,760
download enable a module but the

00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,490
documentation is what we would say is uh

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,430
is lacking from the developer so you're

00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,660
not actually sure what urls to go to to

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:00,420
configure this module that you just

00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,880
installed module info will actually give

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,840
you a lot of that as well tell you where

00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,160
those kind of things are what the

00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,480
configuration is you don't need to hunt

00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,570
so much but we'll get to that in a

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,570
moment

00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:16,800
menu editor once again another thing to

00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,710
allow you to edit a number of things at

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,619
one time the default way the Drupal

00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,599
works Drupal 6 is especially is that if

00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,760
you have a menu you go into the menu

00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,559
you'll go in you'll see the items you

00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,650
can either add an item or you can edit

00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:34,200
an item one at a time same same kind of

00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:35,849
way the taxonomy work one at a time you

00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,829
can piecemeal go through all your stuff

00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:39,000
well in a larger scale site or if you

00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:40,470
just want to save time on your small

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,940
site you may have a menu with 10 items

00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:45,990
so they having to go through each one of

00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:48,480
these they're going to edit menu I

00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,760
believe oh noes power at it I'm sorry

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,329
now you're gonna get this new tab called

00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:56,250
power at it which now everything in his

00:40:54,329 --> 00:40:58,650
hierarchy is shown right here the title

00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:00,660
of the path if it's expanded by default

00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:02,910
all these things you can make changes to

00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,190
30 innings at one time if you wanted to

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:07,050
oh you know theoretically it's unlimited

00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:08,640
how many you could but you can make

00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:10,950
these kind of changes wholesale changes

00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,619
like said this whole talk is about how

00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:16,200
to make how to save yourself time how to

00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:19,470
make this a lot easier experience a lot

00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,150
less time-consuming experience drupal's

00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,680
a content management system you want it

00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,900
to manage your content well in order to

00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,160
manage manage the content yourself you

00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:28,619
need to be able to use it and use it as

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,190
quickly as possible these are all

00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:33,780
shortcuts of ways that ways that you can

00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,490
make changes that you couldn't

00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:36,930
necessarily make by default all these

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:38,730
kind of things you can make these

00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:40,170
changes individually but these are all

00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,210
things that are automate this process

00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:44,520
make this much faster cleaner process

00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:46,920
save you time save you money save you I

00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:48,180
think once again you can see that all

00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,000
these different things are here you can

00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:52,559
delete a number of these at one time if

00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,130
you have a large menu like this it could

00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:57,690
take you 10 15 minutes an hour to make

00:41:56,130 --> 00:42:01,309
these kind of changes opposed to a

00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:01,309
minute here yes question

00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:16,980
yes that's great okay the the question

00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,869
was this menu this this module this menu

00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,359
editor module comes with sub modules a

00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:24,150
lot of modules in Drupal do that views

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,590
comes with a number of them a lot of one

00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:27,510
will this kind of stuff where they

00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:31,350
depended on on their parent or they met

00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:34,530
me dependent at all menu editor node

00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:36,750
creation is what like it just says here

00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:40,020
and it allows you to make a placeholder

00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:42,450
like you may be going ahead and add in

00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,920
piece of content say or you know you're

00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,590
writing a new article or something like

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:49,590
that but you're not ready to sign a path

00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,180
yet you're not ready to let it be seen

00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:57,270
to the world you just want it to be node

00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:59,160
/ 580 6230 instead of having that this

00:42:57,270 --> 00:43:00,660
will let you say okay well when it's

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,400
ready this is where this is going to go

00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,780
on the menu it's just a placeholder for

00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:09,450
it the path path autocomplete is really

00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:11,630
nice on a large site where you may have

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:13,980
menus that are just kind of pointing to

00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:18,080
two arbitrary nodes or things like that

00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:21,950
you want to say okay instead of going to

00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,000
go into the menu and add in a new item

00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:25,320
individually and then going okay well

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,119
where's that page let me make sure I get

00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:28,619
the right path for it those kind of

00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,280
things and copy it over this will

00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:30,990
actually give you a nice little

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,090
autocomplete start taking the title or

00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,950
certain types of the pack to it it'll

00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:36,930
auto complete for you'll say okay well

00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:39,869
you know I know the first word of that

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:41,310
that thing was you know Montana you

00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:43,200
start typed in Montana and it'll give

00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:45,300
you all the different matching results

00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,859
for Montana and then you go okay it's

00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:49,230
this one boom there you don't have to go

00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:51,810
back and search the Edmond Edmond

00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:53,369
content node you don't need to use vuze

00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:54,750
to write your own stuff to kind of you

00:43:53,369 --> 00:43:56,540
know find all these things this will

00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,540
just give you a nice little autocomplete

00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,540
good

00:44:00,819 --> 00:44:06,770
module and thought about this shortly

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,119
ago you'll notice that if you go to the

00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:11,089
admin build models page you have you

00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:13,730
already here you'll notice that each one

00:44:11,089 --> 00:44:16,040
of these now has a little little link

00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:19,280
for module info you want to click on the

00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:22,670
add context I guess when you click this

00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,109
link it'll give you a little bit of info

00:44:22,670 --> 00:44:25,790
about them let's try a different one Oh

00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,400
contacts you why sorry because that's

00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:30,460
the that's the default here see you'll

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,230
notice that like I said before sometimes

00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,690
people that contribute some Drupal

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:39,500
modules may not actually have the time

00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:42,170
or may not have the knowledge to sit

00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,420
down and take take good documentation

00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,369
put it on the project page those kind of

00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,190
things say you found a module that does

00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:50,569
exactly what you want to do but instead

00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,000
of having to look through the code and

00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:54,319
try to find out where all the the hook

00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,059
menus are and all those kind of things

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:57,829
to find out where where do i go to

00:44:56,059 --> 00:44:59,960
configure this module you know I just

00:44:57,829 --> 00:45:02,180
download this thing I just want to kick

00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,319
it around it's in a sandbox I don't want

00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,180
to spend time looking at the code right

00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:07,309
now how do I found out where to go to

00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:09,740
look for for the functionality of this

00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:11,540
well if you install module info you now

00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,190
have this you'll see there's a settings

00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:14,809
to go to the settings page it'll

00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:16,900
actually give you a link to it it'll

00:45:14,809 --> 00:45:19,190
tell you it's under it's under sites are

00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:21,619
administered site-building context

00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:22,910
settings so I can actually do that right

00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:25,309
in the path one wanted to or I just

00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:26,660
click on this there's context inspector

00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:28,849
there's there's a number of these kind

00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:31,280
of links here there you want to click

00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:33,079
back on the taste you directly to the

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,240
settings for this it gives you a nice

00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:37,040
little shortcut and start and you know

00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,839
trying to dig through and guess where

00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,640
things might be said of go into the

00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:42,680
straight admin page and just looking for

00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,329
the name of the module you'll have this

00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:47,680
little this little settings here will

00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:47,680
tell you where to go directly

00:45:56,529 --> 00:46:03,680
tab pamer is another nice little utility

00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:06,109
module here you'll notice that on a lot

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,119
of teens when you start you start

00:46:06,109 --> 00:46:09,440
logging in as a privileged user they'll

00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,569
give you a little tabs at the top for

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,569
edit for view for delete those kind of

00:46:11,569 --> 00:46:16,400
things well you may not want to

00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:18,049
necessarily take those permissions away

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,289
from somebody but you may want to hide

00:46:18,049 --> 00:46:23,180
the tab if you go to just / admin there

00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:25,190
be tab tamer on the bottom right I

00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,500
believe you may just want to go ahead

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:30,160
and you may want to reorder it you may

00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,720
have 10 different tabs depending on what

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,849
contributed modules you've used you may

00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,980
have no to use installed you may have

00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:38,329
all these kind of things you want to you

00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,480
might want to rename that instead of

00:46:38,329 --> 00:46:42,680
saying node q you might want to call it

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,259
front page slider because that's what

00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,349
what's driving the front page slider so

00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:50,839
that your your end user doesn't have to

00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:53,210
know that oh that front page thing in

00:46:50,839 --> 00:46:55,460
order for me to change that I go to the

00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:56,539
node Hugh I think it is and change the

00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,970
surround you can actually name these

00:46:56,539 --> 00:47:00,529
you'll see you got view edit revisions

00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:02,390
to Val right now like that as other

00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:04,460
modules are enabled you'll have these

00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:06,049
the night that gives this nice little

00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:11,869
way of changing the what it's actually

00:47:06,049 --> 00:47:13,849
called yep yeah perfect you can actually

00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:15,680
hide them you can completely disable

00:47:13,849 --> 00:47:18,759
them you can move them up and down using

00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:21,200
the weighting system that Drupal has

00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:22,309
we'll go ahead and do that and just save

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,589
it and we'll go ahead and take a look at

00:47:22,309 --> 00:47:30,289
one now you know this list can actually

00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:33,529
get really long by the way so let's just

00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:35,539
go to there you go so you'll see right

00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:37,039
now you've got view at it devolved now

00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:38,750
that he's changed that link when he

00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:42,019
changes that analysis changing the

00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,549
content it's a lot nicer for for the

00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:45,529
people that aren't developers people in

00:47:43,549 --> 00:47:47,359
our Drupal experts people that don't do

00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,400
this for a living to just be able to go

00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:51,289
okay well I know what that means I don't

00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:53,240
necessarily know what it means or you

00:47:51,289 --> 00:47:54,710
know edit is a little different develop

00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,690
I don't know what develops I don't know

00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,460
what node q is but if I give it a nice

00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,779
little title that makes sense now I can

00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,109
I could point people there and point

00:47:59,779 --> 00:48:04,579
them in a hurry so I think we've got a

00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:05,080
few more I'm just going to kind of gloss

00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:06,580
over

00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,720
real quick because we're starting to get

00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,430
a little closer on time and I want to

00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:15,280
want to open up the discussions at the

00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:16,950
end better formats so basically you can

00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:21,310
give different users and different roles

00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:23,320
different different I'm trying to think

00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:26,620
the way to say the input formats

00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:28,210
basically you can let people say okay my

00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:31,810
content editors they don't know HTML

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:35,710
they they can't have they only get

00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:39,970
filtered HTML to begin with but my web

00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:42,760
development team has PHP and has a full

00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:44,800
HTML and has filtered HTML well by

00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,410
default you know they're always going to

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,140
use full HTML so better floor mats lets

00:48:47,410 --> 00:48:51,640
you go ahead and buy roll select which

00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:54,640
particular filter that they're going to

00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:56,350
use so that way you say okay well if

00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,140
they're of this if they're developer

00:48:56,350 --> 00:49:00,460
make them default to full HTML because

00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:02,560
what you'll end up having a lot of times

00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:04,510
is some you'll have developer that's in

00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,250
a hurry he wants to go ahead and put a

00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:08,170
little widget on your site or something

00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:10,180
like that it's just before lunch he's

00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,560
getting ready to run out the door he say

00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:13,330
hey I need you to do this he goes okay

00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:15,730
all i have to do is add this content

00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:17,500
type let me slap in this little code hit

00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:19,990
save and i'm gonna get out of here well

00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,060
when he does that because you know it's

00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,740
not defaulted to full HTML all of a

00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:26,590
sudden now on where that pretty little

00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:28,480
widget is you see script equals blah

00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:30,250
blah blah blah blah blah blah and that's

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,420
no good one because you're just showing

00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:33,820
everybody or code at that point

00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:37,270
especially its PHP code that's real bad

00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:39,160
but you may want to you may want to save

00:49:37,270 --> 00:49:40,630
that bit of hassle this may only happen

00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,400
to you once they may happen to you a

00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,140
hundred times but this gives you a nice

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,970
little way of saying okay Walter

00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,070
developer always make them do this if

00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:49,540
they're a content entry person and they

00:49:48,070 --> 00:49:51,160
have multiple ways they can put

00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,990
something in default it to the most sane

00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,990
one form instead of having a site-wide

00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:58,840
default let's do it for individual roles

00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:01,620
that way we don't get you know script

00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,030
tags put on our front page of you know

00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:05,560
the New York Times which has happened

00:50:04,030 --> 00:50:08,410
because they're a nice little Drupal

00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:11,080
shop two up there now go ahead easy

00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:13,060
launch easy launch it is a nice little

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:17,200
block it gives you basically lets you

00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:18,779
kind of start typing in different menus

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,189
menu items and

00:50:18,779 --> 00:50:21,119
she launched directly from there we're

00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:23,039
not going to go ahead and show this one

00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:24,599
because we're just going to kind of talk

00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:27,989
about it real quick it's got some neat

00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:30,539
little JavaScript d kind of stuff you

00:50:27,989 --> 00:50:31,829
can use it and it's really nice because

00:50:30,539 --> 00:50:33,419
it puts them that block it gives you

00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,189
complete control over to where you put

00:50:33,419 --> 00:50:37,199
this on the site instead of like the

00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:38,849
admin admin module that puts in the

00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,109
upper left hand corner this thing is

00:50:38,849 --> 00:50:42,269
just a block it lets you put it anywhere

00:50:40,109 --> 00:50:44,249
and you can just start typing different

00:50:42,269 --> 00:50:44,999
different pieces of functionality and it

00:50:44,249 --> 00:50:48,359
will actually give you little

00:50:44,999 --> 00:50:49,709
suggestions is where to go the problem

00:50:48,359 --> 00:50:52,650
with it is if you start doing some crazy

00:50:49,709 --> 00:50:55,249
jquery stuff and and things like that on

00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:57,959
your site you may actually break this so

00:50:55,249 --> 00:50:59,400
nice for you know if you have a small

00:50:57,959 --> 00:51:00,900
site you just want to get people quick

00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,369
way to get stuff you were just running

00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:03,419
your own blog site something like that

00:51:02,369 --> 00:51:05,789
and you don't want to have all these

00:51:03,419 --> 00:51:07,619
other modules that are cluttering up

00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:08,729
your your site make it run a little bit

00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:11,189
slower because for every module you

00:51:08,729 --> 00:51:14,369
enable that's a little bit more code

00:51:11,189 --> 00:51:16,859
that the platform has to has to digest

00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:18,419
every time the page is loaded it's an

00:51:16,859 --> 00:51:20,309
applicant ripples an application it

00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:22,679
reads all those files all the time so

00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:26,880
the more stuff you have the slower your

00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:28,529
site is going to be good checkbox filter

00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,380
that's that goes back when we were

00:51:28,529 --> 00:51:34,439
talking about before once you get on

00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,449
really useful on permissions pages some

00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:38,489
of these things are different ways of

00:51:36,449 --> 00:51:40,979
doing the same thing we had the the

00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:42,269
filter permissions earlier this is

00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:44,009
another way to kind of use that where

00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:45,689
you can start just starting to type in

00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:47,549
the name of the module or start typing

00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:49,589
in the name of the different permission

00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:51,509
or type in the name of whatever checkbox

00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:53,390
might be on the page and it'll give you

00:51:51,509 --> 00:51:55,529
a little place to jump right to that

00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:57,869
like said I don't use it very often

00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:59,759
because I use the filter permissions

00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:01,289
which gives me most of the functionality

00:51:59,759 --> 00:52:03,959
I want I don't usually give people

00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:05,219
checkboxes on site I like to do select

00:52:03,959 --> 00:52:06,869
lists I'd like to do those kind of

00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:08,309
things instead but it's a nice one

00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:15,179
that's out there that you know you may

00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:18,719
find useful content lock really really

00:52:15,179 --> 00:52:21,929
useful on once again multi-user site if

00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,849
you have a content editor you know that

00:52:21,929 --> 00:52:25,439
may not be in the same room or even may

00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:27,630
be in the same room as another content

00:52:25,439 --> 00:52:30,150
editor and you're both making changes to

00:52:27,630 --> 00:52:31,260
the same node at the same time well you

00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:33,270
got race conditions

00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,800
whoever gets their last is the one

00:52:33,270 --> 00:52:37,230
that's going to win because that's the

00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:39,690
one that's going to be overwritten this

00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:42,060
allows you to say okay it lets you say

00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:44,430
by content type okay well for articles I

00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:45,750
don't want people doing that so for

00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:47,430
articles i'm going to put a content lock

00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:49,470
on what that means is that when somebody

00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,690
is in that particular article or that

00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:53,550
content type of that node and somebody

00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,050
else tries to load the edit page for it

00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,760
it'll give you a nice little red warning

00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:58,410
or whatever colors you have on your site

00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,240
nice little warning at the top saying

00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,280
you can't edit this you know such and

00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,680
such user is already editing it it's

00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,060
locked for now and that means okay well

00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,370
I know that I don't want to make changes

00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:10,680
while they're making changes let them go

00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,090
through once they make their save then

00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,560
you can go back in and you can adjust

00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:16,800
whatever you want to adjust at that

00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,090
point there's also a lock timeout that

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,300
comes to this module it's another sub

00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:22,500
module this gets into what we're talking

00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:24,210
about before with the sub modules but

00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:26,970
this gives you a nice little thing of oh

00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:30,150
well you know meri decided she's going

00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:32,730
to edit the the news story about the the

00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:35,660
church down the street on the front page

00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:37,590
of our site well she started to edit it

00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:40,020
decided oh well I'm gonna go take a

00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:41,610
coffee break I'm gonna go you know have

00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:44,160
a smoke or something she walks outside

00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:46,950
and she's all the 15 minutes she gets

00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:48,450
sick goes home for the day how am I

00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:50,250
going to edit that node you know unless

00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:52,080
you're an admin you wanna be going to

00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:53,670
break it for this gives you a timeout

00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,880
says okay you can set the number of

00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:59,670
seconds maybe 30 second 60 seconds 120

00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,830
seconds whatever where if this amount of

00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:03,990
time passes and that person hasn't

00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:05,100
hasn't saved the node break their lock

00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:07,110
so somebody else can get in there

00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:10,170
there's some other modules out there

00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:12,420
block block does the same kind of thing

00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:15,510
for editing blocks there's a views block

00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,010
as are as well our views locks are as

00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:20,700
well that'll let you do that same kind

00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:24,350
of thing with views but you know this

00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:28,520
one especially very useful go ahead

00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:31,050
improved Edmund this if you start using

00:54:28,520 --> 00:54:34,610
organic groups or you start using a lot

00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:36,990
of taxonomy you start using a number of

00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:38,760
number of controls that start letting

00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:41,100
nodes have a lot more association with

00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:42,770
it instead of going your headman content

00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:44,480
node page that just lifts

00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:48,260
your things and says you know let me

00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,270
filter by content type or filter by you

00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:51,800
know the built-in filtering that Drupal

00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:53,150
gives you this will give you a nice

00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:54,890
little improved admin all the way across

00:54:53,150 --> 00:54:58,010
that'll let you filter about groups

00:54:54,890 --> 00:54:59,420
filter by taxonomy filter by you know

00:54:58,010 --> 00:55:01,760
any different things that might be

00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:04,280
associated with a node this is really

00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,340
useful because a lot of times when you

00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:09,470
get into larger sites you have requests

00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:11,540
from your customers or your clients or

00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:14,180
whatever that say hey can you make me a

00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:15,920
page that lets me make all these kind of

00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,690
filtering things well you can you can

00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,700
use views and expose a bunch of filters

00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:22,250
and all these kind of things it make

00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,130
this thing happen but or you could just

00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:26,420
go and use improved admin enable it boom

00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:28,190
all that functionalities already there

00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,660
for it it's just to say it's a time

00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,540
saver it's a five-minute install as

00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:37,910
opposed to a 20-minute views writing

00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:40,700
session yep question yeah it's it's kind

00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,260
of the same kind of deal this has a

00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,410
little bit more control on which

00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,850
particular filters you display I believe

00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:49,310
it actually even has permissions that

00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:53,810
says you can use the group group filter

00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:54,920
or you can use this filter that's a very

00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,350
good question there there's a lot of

00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:59,240
modules out there because like said it

00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:02,720
is a free wielding community that's

00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:05,660
growing you know Stephen and I may write

00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:07,010
a module and then you know three weeks

00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:09,950
later somebody else may were in a module

00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:12,230
that's essentially the same as ours but

00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:13,700
there's dozens of a little different way

00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:17,060
or they have some different

00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:18,980
functionality so you end up with modules

00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:21,500
that do the same kind of thing that are

00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,700
only tailored to the specific set of

00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:25,100
requirements they have when they wrote

00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,000
it that's why we always try before we

00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,130
decide that we're going to write a

00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,710
module always always always before you

00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:32,420
decide you want to you know go out and

00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,890
write your own module look and see

00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:35,330
what's already out there don't reinvent

00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,410
the wheel that's what Drupal is about

00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:38,990
that's what this community is about

00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:41,150
don't waste your time doing something

00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:42,650
somebody's already done it may not be

00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:44,270
exactly the way you want it and if it

00:56:42,650 --> 00:56:47,660
does if it isn't use it as a starting

00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:50,240
point improve their code use their code

00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:52,310
as a base as a framework and change it

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,230
don't don't go ahead and decide that I'm

00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,680
going to rewrite you know rewrite this

00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:56,480
or I'm

00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:58,010
rewrite that if there's not a specific

00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,390
need for it you're just you're spending

00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:01,040
your time that you don't need to be

00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:03,350
spending you're wasting either your

00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,910
boss's time or your clients time use

00:57:03,350 --> 00:57:06,650
what's already out there there's a you

00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,930
know the searching on drupal.org is

00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:10,640
really nice Google you know Google index

00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:13,100
is everything you can use Google to find

00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,230
what you're looking for always search

00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:17,720
before you go ahead and start writing a

00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:19,850
lot of developers will want to just just

00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:29,060
you get get into cases where people

00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:31,370
decide that they want to they want to go

00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:33,740

00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:46,640
John Doe trained his replacement and

00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:48,620
gave him the same credentials that

00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:50,300
wasn't the way to do it but that's what

00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:52,880
happened now you just deleted your other

00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:55,100
user out there you can use in critical

00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,100
users you can flag particular users in

00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:59,660
the system like user one believe it or

00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:03,380
not people try to delete the admin user

00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:04,640
and people do delete the admin user you

00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,340
start deleting things that you don't

00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,380

00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,590
those things that says you can't you

00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:20,090
can't delete these unless you go into

00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:22,070
specific admin area for this and uncheck

00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,840
that and then delete it just another

00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:28,730
little check to make sure you don't do

00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:30,590
