00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,269
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,390
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,059
make these videos possible alright well

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,340
thanks y'all for coming I'm Nikolai

00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,940
Burton I run the Charleston drip user

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,800
group in South Carolina and I just

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,840
wanted to do a little overview of civ

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,100
ecrm rather than slide so I'm going to

00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,160
do more of a walk through and talk about

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,960
what civvy can do for you either as a

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,750
non-profit if you're working for one or

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,219
if you're an implementer and you know

00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,050
you're already doing Drupal sites and

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,600
you want to try to put CRM in there and

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,219
there's not really any great you know

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,870
the Drupal CRM project didn't quite work

00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,240
out and the sugar isn't really a good

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,920
fit for nonprofits and then the other

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,270
software is just tends to be

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,479
ridiculously expensive or not very

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,400
useful in terms of CRM systems so

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,720
civvies really awesome it's been around

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:22,340
a few years and it works both in Drupal

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,810
and in joomla and there's a little

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,549
grassroots thing they're trying to

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,159
actually find it for WordPress as well

00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,200
so you can once you learn this you can

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,420
kind of take it to eventually any of the

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:39,119
big CMS's civvy CRM is CRM for the Civic

00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,200
sector this is not something you wanna

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,200
consider if you're looking at it for

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,210
like a sales organization it's very non

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,049
profit driven civvy lets you manage

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,909
contributions memberships we can do

00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,710
special events like fundraising events

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,560
where you need to sell registrations and

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:57,090
maybe give out swag because we can do

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:01,560
premiums we can do different event

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:03,119
levels it works for grant management not

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,439
on the application side but if you're an

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,840
organization that is a granting

00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,099
organization like a United Way kind of

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,950
thing where you're puling other people's

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,050
money and giving it out it can handle

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,010
pledges with pledge reminders on a

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,530
regular basis I'll

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,829
automated and we can do case management

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:22,560
for some of the humanitarian and and

00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:25,280
Gordon zom you know the organizations

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,189
that are dealing with a case work like

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:33,420
homeless shelters you know domestic

00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:35,129
abuse centers that kind of thing and one

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,250
of the other cool things is it's got

00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:40,049
built in email marketing I mean you can

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:42,239
do the whole MailChimp thing or work

00:02:40,049 --> 00:02:43,829
with another source for it and it's got

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,349
a little bit of push and pull into some

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,849
of these different systems but their

00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:49,709
email marketing is pretty solid on its

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,659
own we've got open tracking click

00:02:49,709 --> 00:02:58,560
tracking anything that you can get from

00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:59,819
the professional software suites so I'm

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,840
just going to run through like just

00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,780
can't start going through some of the

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,290
screens and show you basically what what

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:12,209
we're looking at with City and I will

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:17,900
start by giving some response from my

00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,900
mouse there we go

00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,490
maybe

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,129
alright so with contacts you can do

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,120
multiple types this one's the sample

00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:35,250
data is geared a little more towards the

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,560
school I've got my students parents and

00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,510
staff so definitely does from your

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,579
question earlier about universities you

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,579
can do that for that works quite well

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,250
feeling a little slow here I'm not even

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:52,250
on the Wi-Fi

00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,669
whoa

00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,090
sorry all I don't know what's up here

00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:58,540
let's just restart Firefox

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,369
I apologize just bear with me some work

00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:21,009
and find all morning so I don't know

00:05:09,369 --> 00:05:23,319
what's up here all right well while it's

00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,909
doing its thing one of the other really

00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,710
cool things about civvy is we can create

00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,409
custom fields on any of our object types

00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:33,069
our main object types are contacts

00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:37,089
memberships events participants for

00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:38,649
those events and so for any of those you

00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,860
can have an unlimited number of custom

00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:43,119
fields so for example it doesn't have

00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,349
like a volunteer management thing out of

00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:46,659
the box so what we can do is create a

00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,490
custom field group and we'll call it

00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:50,439
volunteer info and then we can maybe set

00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,029
availability with some date fields we

00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:55,029
can set their preferences with a series

00:05:52,029 --> 00:05:56,830
of checkboxes and all this kind of stuff

00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:59,740
they can manage themselves like your

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,809
your users aren't I can because civvy

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,369
users will sync with Drupal users or

00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:10,659
civvy contacts i should say will sync

00:06:03,369 --> 00:06:12,610
with drupal users and it's got an actual

00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:14,889
a really cool feature on here to where

00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:17,919
your when we create relationships with

00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,330
folks you know spouse's or parents and

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,180
children or whatever kind of set up

00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,249
there one of the people if you allow it

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,139
can edit the other person's information

00:06:24,249 --> 00:06:28,539
so like a head of household can keep

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:30,069
everybody's info up to date and we've

00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:31,330
got address sharing so you only have to

00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:32,800
enter an address once and when it

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,089
changes you don't have to try to

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,159
remember everyone else who's at that

00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:40,259
address you just share it out change at

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:40,259
one time and then you're all set

00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,260
I

00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,510
we'll try to launch him again I had

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,210
mentioned unlimited contact types and

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:01,260
and there's there's sort of three levels

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:03,480
of things we can do we have contact

00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:04,590
types which sort of define a person in

00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,370
which fields are available for that

00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,620
person and then we have tags and groups

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,330
groups are usually used either for

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:14,580
querying on folks we can create a smart

00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,930
group that says I want everyone whose

00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,850
membership is going to expire in the

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,320
next 30 days because I'm going to do an

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:21,630
export and go ahead and send them

00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:23,070
membership reminders or give them to a

00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,800
volunteer to start calling folks and

00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:27,300
then we have tags which are I think of

00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,290
tags is what this person is your

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:34,560
organization are they a volunteer they a

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:38,720
board member are they a potential major

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,720
donor a prospect kind of situation and

00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,350
every one of these things i'm mentioning

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:54,450
is queryable it's got a nice front end

00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:59,010
query you I only none of it wants to

00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:00,690
load you know for simplicity I might

00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:03,930
skip off of my vm for the moment and

00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:05,400
just show you a live civvy site I wasn't

00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:07,910
sure how good tho Wi-Fi was going to be

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,910
so

00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:20,590
ok

00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:40,579
alright so I'm just gonna do a basic

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,959
search for myself here and will run

00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:44,919
through kind of what the records look

00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:44,919
like and what we can do with them

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,810
so we've got a nice little summary we

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,680
got all the main stuff easily clickable

00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,269
different kinds of addresses you can do

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,940
unlimited addresses unlimited phone

00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:05,250
numbers emails websites any of that kind

00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,450
of stuff you're not trapped like some of

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,160
these systems will hard code you into

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,480
one or two of these different types

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,140
which really gets annoying after a while

00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:18,540
especially when you deal with a lot of

00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:20,310
donors who move a lot yes the question

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,820
was going to do both imports absolutely

00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,410
we've got an import tool in here so you

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,450
can do conversions from other systems or

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,070
just if you're getting may be mailing

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:32,160
results or you're buying donor lists or

00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:36,240
things like that absolutely and we map

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,430
the fields in the CSV file to what we've

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,370
got in the system here so you're not as

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:44,070
tied down and having the actual CSV file

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:51,000
itself be perfect you're going to choose

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:53,459
which column goes to which so I'm going

00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,170
to run through like a back office

00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:57,360
contribution because anything you can do

00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:58,970
through the public site you can do as a

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,870
user because a lot of these places have

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,970
development offices or membership

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,860
offices where they're getting a lot of

00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,100
stuff in the mail and you got you know

00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,300
some volunteer some kid who's just

00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,800
opening up mmmm elopes writing down the

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
check moving on to the next one and

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,850
letting the system take care of

00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:16,560
acknowledgment and everything like that

00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:19,170
so from the back side we've got

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,440
contribution types which are unlimited i

00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:25,430
created a couple of basic ones if you're

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,810
familiar much with nonprofit accounting

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,690
contribution types always tied it like a

00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,720
GL account number so think of them maybe

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:35,699
as funds you might I've gone pretty

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,220
basic here you might have general fund

00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:40,140
Annual Fund special restricted funds are

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:48,060
used for projects or building that kind

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:50,130
of thing we do sources I do that at my

00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,990
organization with contribution sources

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:55,560
so you can actually find out later what

00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:58,920
was effective that query ability is

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,940
there so we just you know if we spend a

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,570
bunch of money sending out a direct

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,380
mailing did it work did it matter

00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:08,360
did anyone come or give us money and for

00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:10,840
any contributions we do here you can

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,550
either wait send out the paper

00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,350
acknowledgments or we can go ahead and

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,250
send email receipts right away to the

00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,870
people which is pretty cool for

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,630
contributions it's kind of set here

00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:25,820
you'll notice that I don't have much of

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:30,110
an ability on what I can put in my

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:31,580
message so we've got message templates

00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,720
for all this kind of thing and then for

00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,570
some of the other options like

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,860
membership receipts you can send a

00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:53,540
little personal note that comes with

00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:55,340
their contribution receipt yes it has a

00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,690
reporting wing if there's there's not

00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,340
like a great report builder in there

00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,840
we've got a search builder where you

00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:05,150
pick you can pick your filters in your

00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:06,680
fields yep you can export any of your

00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,660
client list to CSV and choose what

00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,340
fields you want to export oh sorry the

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,980
question was can you export to CSV so

00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,720
yes just like we can import anything on

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:17,030
the major kind of object types you can

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,280
export it all and there there is like a

00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:22,220
basic reporting system that's kind of

00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,200
getting there but it's definitely you'll

00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,990
you'll be writing the PHP for it it

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,790
provides a template for you and you you

00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:31,730
write in PHP what's your criteria are

00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,930
what your columns are pretty much the

00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,570
whole thing it's almost like you're

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:37,850
working in like a crystal or or Bert

00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:39,650
reports or that kind of thing at the

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,820
level that you're having to write the

00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:46,310
report yourself they do have if you're

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,590
on the political side of things they've

00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,700
got a canvassing module which I haven't

00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:51,710
worked much with I could get out the

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,120
vote kind of thing where we can create

00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:57,980
lists to hand people so they can go out

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,330
door-to-door and then report back I was

00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:02,960
originally what the system was designed

00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:04,940
for was meant to be political campaigns

00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,410
or like I shouldn't say political

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:08,950
campaigns like political activism

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,950
campaigns

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:20,300
I want to go ahead and show you some of

00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:22,580
our profile ability so another cool

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,270
thing with the with the self-service

00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:30,080
self-service is all based on profiles

00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,580
and profiles are lists of fields that

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,970
you want to expose to your users that

00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:41,000
they can enter on their own so I'm going

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:42,200
to go to my account and when we set up a

00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,880
profile you can say where you want it to

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,520
show so we can create blocks you can

00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,200
actually grab an HTML snippet you can

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,350
put the profile on somebody static HTML

00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:52,490
site you don't have to use Drupal to be

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:59,600
able to take advantage of a lot of the

00:13:52,490 --> 00:14:00,920
functionality of say to CRM so I'm not a

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,860
great themer but i'll go ahead and edit

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:11,839
my profile here and my profile with just

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:13,790
what i called that set of fields and i

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,810
can do things like set what the person

00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,800
can just see versus what they can edit

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,600
notice I've got this newsletter option I

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,490
dimension groups one of the ways for

00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:24,709
that we can use groups is for querying

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,950
and the other way is for mailing so

00:14:24,709 --> 00:14:31,580
people opt-in and opt-out you can opt

00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:33,470
them in and then for legal reasons every

00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:37,310
email newsletter forces you to put an

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:38,750
opt-out token in it so it kind of drives

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,750
you towards best practices for email

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,250
marketing and then the stuff at the

00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:44,839
bottom is a series of custom fields that

00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,209
we did for volunteering to just gauge

00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,760
people's interest and then pull that

00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:51,589
list email then to find out you know

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,950
when they want to work with us yes was

00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:53,950
question

00:14:57,810 --> 00:15:02,650
the question was for email opt outs is

00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:06,100
that all handled through civvy and yes

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:08,710
it is I can go I can either opt out a

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,870
person on my own or they can go to their

00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,279
record and I mean they can click on

00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,029
their link in the email and that will

00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,620
opt them out so it works again back

00:15:16,029 --> 00:15:22,300
office or front office we've got options

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:25,150
to do you know don't do not phone do not

00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:32,880
email do not contact me at all and keep

00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:32,880
me out of all bulk mailings yes

00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:43,560
there's not a whole lot on the Drupal

00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,630
site about it and I think that's no I'm

00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:49,530
sorry the question was is there any

00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:51,090
documentation about civvy and there is

00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:54,690
it's out there you won't find it really

00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:57,300
on drupal.org soubise erm org is the

00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:59,400
main place to go they have forums and

00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,380
they they have a regular blog post so

00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:06,750
you can see the cool new stuff they're

00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:09,120
doing and there is a full-on user guide

00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:11,330
it's it's weak in places like I'll

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,620
definitely tell you that straight up

00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,450
sometimes you have to kind of bang

00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,580
around on it and until you get lucky or

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:21,780
get on to the forums or IRC to get help

00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,610
with certain things but but the

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:26,000
documentation is improving they they

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:30,510
have written a brief user guide it's

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,100
floss manuals net it's um that's a

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,450
website dedicated to user guides for

00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,450
open source software and there is a

00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,580
civvie guide on there it doesn't get

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,810
into some of the specifics or some of

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,900
them were arcane things you have to do

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:45,510
like there there's some magic and voodoo

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,680
two views integration it's not just flip

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:54,120
it on and go there's a bunch of

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:55,650
modifying files so what should I show

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,000
you did you want to join me to run

00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,660
through maybe a sample mailing because I

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,200
imagine that's something that every

00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,200
organization is going to use

00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:15,350
so I'd mentioned groups just going to

00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:16,789
include admins for now and Sevilla is

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:19,129
compatible there's three point four

00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:20,779
which is for Drupal 6 and four point oh

00:17:19,129 --> 00:17:24,979
for Drupal 7 so it is already available

00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:27,049
for seven I mentioned you can do click

00:17:24,979 --> 00:17:28,580
tracking open tracking it can also if

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,220
you send it out from a certain address

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:34,820
and they reply we can log that on their

00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:37,249
record as an activity automatically so

00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,509
more if your if your goal is to get them

00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:40,279
actually do something from the email

00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:44,499
versus just read it we can go ahead and

00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,499
log that without extra manual work yes

00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:52,099
the question was does it have

00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:55,099
petitioning ability I've seen a drupal

00:17:52,099 --> 00:17:57,289
module called petition I don't know how

00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:58,580
up to date that is but there is some

00:17:57,289 --> 00:18:01,099
limited functionality in here for this

00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:04,999
and just recently like within the last

00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:08,059
three or four weeks droop or city has

00:18:04,999 --> 00:18:09,440
added web form integration so now if you

00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:12,529
want to do your petition as a web form

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,599
like the drupal webforms you can tie

00:18:12,529 --> 00:18:16,639
those submissions to automatically

00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:18,109
create new contacts or match existing

00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:21,649
contacts if those people are logged in

00:18:18,109 --> 00:18:22,999
using the drupal account and that data

00:18:21,649 --> 00:18:26,210
is going to automatically push and pull

00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:28,249
for you so well there's not that I know

00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:29,869
of like a dedicated petition module I

00:18:28,249 --> 00:18:39,019
think with this new integration it's

00:18:29,869 --> 00:18:40,789
going to work great for that so for

00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,039
their mailing whatever you're more

00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:46,789
familiar with or whatever users like we

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:49,759
can do a straight up HTML create your

00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:52,759
template put your tokens in place or you

00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,970
can do it on screen and it's kind of

00:18:52,759 --> 00:19:00,340
like a mail merge we can just hit insert

00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:00,340
token and weird in my tokens go

00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:09,499
there goes so pretty much any contact

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,049
field we can throw into mailings without

00:19:09,499 --> 00:19:20,570
having to do an export in a mail merge

00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:23,240
in an external system and this lets you

00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:25,340
for the mailing we can do preset headers

00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:28,549
and footers what I like to do for folks

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,169
is put those required opt-out links

00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:31,429
unsubscribe links in the footer so they

00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,799
don't have to rewrite it every time

00:19:31,429 --> 00:19:35,809
they're writing a new message just

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,289
create an HTML sniff it and stick it in

00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:38,289
there at the bottom

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,159
and mailing can be queued which is kind

00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:56,669
of cool because a lot of these

00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:59,820
nonprofits aren't paying for big smtp

00:19:56,669 --> 00:20:02,039
servers or a lot of throughput like for

00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,600
example you know Google Apps for your

00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,879
domain limits into 200 emails an hour

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,299
and if you've got a 5,000 person mailing

00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:10,710
list everyone from number 201 5,000 is

00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:14,669
going to bounce and just destroy your

00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:16,679
inbox so sippy has a queuing mechanism

00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:19,980
so what we can do is mailing runs on

00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,049
cron so say every half hour I'm going to

00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,360
run 75 and it will just batch those

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:26,009
seventy five in a row until it reaches

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,809
the end so that way you can spread that

00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,100
mailing out over a few hours not worry

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:31,679
about hitting any limits and getting a

00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:33,899
lot of bounces back which is pretty

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,049
awesome and I haven't seen many of the

00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:38,940
other systems that like many of the

00:20:37,049 --> 00:20:41,009
other like downloadable you know install

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:44,700
we'll email marketing apps that can do

00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:46,769
that I know like constant contact and

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,330
MailChimp does but that's you know a

00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:51,379
paid service versus something that we've

00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,379
got built into this program

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,840
and you can schedule them ahead of time

00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:06,200
which is pretty cool if you're dealing

00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:08,059
with different like I don't know if you

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,679
want to send it out at a certain time of

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,570
day maybe for for some kind of political

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,639
reason maybe you know there's going to

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:15,799
be like a presidential or governor

00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,970
speech at 10am and you want to have this

00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:19,370
thing all ready to go because you know

00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:20,480
what you're gonna say and so you send

00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,549
that out you know as soon as they're

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,690
done call your senator and send out that

00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:27,259
call to action immediately after

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:29,870
something like that questions about

00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:31,580
mailing I was going to go ahead and just

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:39,169
maybe pop into some other modules or

00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:42,559
other sections in here no all right so

00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:43,909
special events are cool I need to get

00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:46,690
them from in here though because this is

00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,690
where I have them all set up

00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:57,529
or

00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:08,320
try it with chrome

00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:11,860
so special fundraising events we can

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:14,350
allow the folks to go online and

00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:16,570
register one or more people you can set

00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:18,100
limits on that kind of thing they can

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,559
choose different levels of event

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,999
registration think of like if you're

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:24,009
going to run some kind of conference or

00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:25,659
something like that you've got your

00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,239
basic level you want to throw in lunch

00:22:25,659 --> 00:22:32,230
you want to throw in t-shirts that kind

00:22:28,239 --> 00:22:33,399
of thing and different add-ons so we got

00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,409
different levels there we've got pay

00:22:33,399 --> 00:22:38,590
later versus having to pay right now

00:22:35,409 --> 00:22:39,669
which is I don't see that used much I

00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:43,570
think that might be more of a you

00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:54,999
placing generally the nonprofit's I work

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:57,879
with want your money right away there

00:22:54,999 --> 00:23:01,559
are about 12 you can use authorize.net

00:22:57,879 --> 00:23:05,649
sorry what's the processor for payments

00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:10,269
authorize.net elevon paypal pay plot

00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:11,980
payflow pro there's some few country

00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:14,109
specific ones and if there's not already

00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:17,169
a processor it's not too difficult to

00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:20,009
write your own processor integration is

00:23:17,169 --> 00:23:20,009
pretty straightforward

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:32,240
all right I'm Drupal guy but I'm not

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,799
linux guys they're like a task manager

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:52,909
equivalent where I can just kill Firefox

00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:55,750
so it stops in the GUI gotcha this guy

00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:58,370
doesn't you want to go in there does he

00:23:55,750 --> 00:24:03,190
this is acting like a vm prevalent more

00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:03,190
than it probably is yeah

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,309
I try to kill that one yeah either of

00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:50,000
them I'll just going to try to run it in

00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:50,000
chromium instead

00:25:05,299 --> 00:25:09,080
so should both be dead

00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:30,100
alright is a vm thing isn't it all right

00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:31,930
I'll go to Vince on here I wanted to

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:37,570
have some already set up for you to show

00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:38,800
off but event management is generally it

00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,750
always sounds like an easy thing until

00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:42,490
you start talking to the folks

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:45,880
organizing the event because now we want

00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:47,110
to track vendors and we want to have

00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,600
different levels of recognition and

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:52,210
sponsorship and we want to allow people

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:55,690
to pledge at the event and maybe some

00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,340
kind of gala and one of the things we

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,180
can do here with the the views

00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:03,280
integration is do participant listings

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,720
so if you want a lot of folks that come

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,040
to the more these high profile events

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,910
they come because they want to be seen

00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,100
and they want people to know they're

00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:10,450
there as opposed to it being an

00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,880
anonymous thing so we can create

00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:14,320
participant lists with views and display

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:20,200
that either like as a block or a page

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:23,190
somewhere on the Drupal site so I'm

00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,190
going to go ahead and turn that on

00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:42,100
I'm going to set our event to be next

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:43,809
Saturday I can only hold 50 people being

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,400
Klah we've got google map integration on

00:26:43,809 --> 00:26:47,670
here it's not that great so I'm going to

00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,670
show it

00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:59,230
but just going through some of the

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,270
screens you can see it's a pretty easy

00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:05,680
system to use it takes a little time to

00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:08,860
set up but there's nothing really crazy

00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:11,380
about actually day-to-day usage and

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,360
training you can probably get away with

00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:15,430
giving folks you know a half day of

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,340
training and they can pretty much take

00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:20,340
it and run with it from that yes

00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:41,000
the question is can we do like roi

00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,250
tracking on things other than email and

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,670
we absolutely can that's why we have we

00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,500
have activities so what what I would do

00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:51,770
is you send out a direct mailing and

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,470
then based on responses to that either

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:56,390
have people enter it as an activity

00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,300
directly or put it into a big CSV file

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:05,510
and import it all at once and then we

00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:07,940
can do some queries on that so I wanted

00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:11,150
to show this which not many folks are

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:14,090
doing when i worked at blackbaud which

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,280
makes like the Cadillac for nonprofit

00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,450
fundraising they were just now getting

00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,850
into this and these guys have had it for

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:22,880
a year or more we've got telef ran

00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:25,460
features so at the end of you making a

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,950
donation or an event or membership we

00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:30,050
can turn on the telefund where that

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,730
person can enter you know a couple of

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:35,660
email addresses and it will forward this

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:37,010
thing on with the link and then we're

00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:40,670
actually able to follow that back to see

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:43,460
if that was effective too so the

00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:45,590
telephone thing is it's nothing like

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,180
super amazing but there aren't many

00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:50,330
systems that are doing it right now it's

00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:52,490
still kind of new to this sector you've

00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,860
seen it in the in the sales kind of area

00:28:52,490 --> 00:29:00,920
a long time but nonprofits are finally

00:28:54,860 --> 00:29:06,770
getting it other cool features I want to

00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:11,030
show you our search builder hours like I

00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:13,550
whatever its search field builder so

00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:17,350
this is I saying for our nice front-end

00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:27,340
query so I'm going to pull all of my

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:27,340
individuals who are not deceased

00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:33,830
and this the stuff on the ends a little

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,240
kludgy we don't have dropdowns yet for

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,820
like multi selects or things like that

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,830
you kind of have to know what your

00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:42,049
operators are but it tends to just

00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,620
follow the this just writes it into PHP

00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:47,419
so however you'd write it that way and

00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:53,000
you see we can do unlimited fields with

00:29:47,419 --> 00:30:01,610
it so I want people who are not do not

00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:04,970
phone and are not dead and i can look

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:09,260
for them and go ahead and maybe set that

00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:16,330
to to do some kind of phonathon all

00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:20,150
right I don't always remember the arcane

00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:23,360
entries that we have to put here there

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:27,289
we go so now I've got my phone a thon

00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:30,140
list it's returned you know 400 records

00:30:27,289 --> 00:30:31,460
so I'm going to grab them all and just

00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,080
from here I don't have to browse around

00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,440
and do a lot more stuff I can go ahead

00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:37,760
and just export these folks from here or

00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,679
if it's not a phone a thon I can go

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,390
ahead and get mailing labels created

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,460
there's a mailing label template it's

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,110
one of those standard Avery's and just

00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,309
print it out right away stick them on

00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:48,309
the little postcards and send those out

00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:54,919
and search builder works on any of the

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,740
major object types again participants

00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,740
events contacts memberships

00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:06,429
yeah to do an ex re the question was

00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:09,220
this is where you do the export so yes

00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:10,989
anytime you want to do an export you do

00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:12,460
some kind of search either a normal

00:31:10,989 --> 00:31:15,759
search they've got an advanced searched

00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:21,669
with the tries to present a lot of

00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:23,230
different fields to you this is

00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:26,860
basically everything from every one of

00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:28,419
our tabs on a person's record including

00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:32,379
custom fields you have to do anything

00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:33,460
special there it just gets added you

00:31:32,379 --> 00:31:34,929
decide whether or not you wanted to show

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:57,970
when you do custom fields whether you

00:31:34,929 --> 00:32:00,820
want them searchable sure the question

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,379
is I'm not sure I get it are you

00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:05,190
thinking like auto merging and like d

00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:05,190
duping that kind of thing

00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:24,490
okay so the question was around what

00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:25,480
what kind of stuff we're tracking in

00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,570
here when something like this happens

00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,980
like we do an export or the mailing so

00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:32,950
yes you can get all of that for

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,650
activities when we do an export you can

00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:37,059
choose to go ahead and log that to

00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:46,270
someone's record as a mailing for

00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:47,320
example so if i wanted to grab yeah I'll

00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:50,110
just run through another quick search

00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,260
here and go into an export so we can see

00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,260
that

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,840
yeah we can actually if we don't even

00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:10,290
wanna do an export record activity for

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,290
contacts

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,440
and

00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,520
and we can say that we called all this

00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,520
people

00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,930
so

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:01,820
and so there's grab all those people

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:06,050
through my my contact or throw my

00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:10,100
activity on there let's see if this

00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:16,610
guy's recovered so really wanted to show

00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:19,450
you the via rules integration which is

00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:19,450
also pretty new

00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:48,129
now he's not well the idea I'll just go

00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:50,440
ahead and I I feel really bad you guys

00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:53,799
that my vm has decided to blow up right

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:57,099
before the session the rules integration

00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:59,859
is very cool we can do on a civvie CRM

00:34:57,099 --> 00:35:03,039
contact being created updated deleted or

00:34:59,859 --> 00:35:04,359
even viewed we can trigger a rule so

00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:08,589
those are those are our conditions so

00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:13,200
whenever I don't know a new contact is

00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:15,670
created that also has a certain level of

00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,319
donations associated with it or

00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:20,410
something like that we can send an email

00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:22,029
to let the boss now I guess I'm more

00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:26,019
useful example is if somebody tried to

00:35:22,029 --> 00:35:27,640
edit a client as a board member I'd want

00:35:26,019 --> 00:35:28,450
to make sure I'm aware that's happening

00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,599
so they're not putting any bad

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,950
information in there so it's you can you

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,319
can kind of set up basic workflows with

00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:38,170
that you can do that with any of the

00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:42,130
object types i believe as well including

00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:45,249
recently mailing the big use case was my

00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:46,660
folks who create my list of recipients

00:35:45,249 --> 00:35:48,969
for the mailing is different from my

00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,519
folks who actually design it and create

00:35:48,969 --> 00:35:54,279
you know craft a message greek HTML

00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,049
template all of that so we could do a

00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:58,890
workflow where once the person finishes

00:35:56,049 --> 00:36:01,089
with their design we trigger a rule that

00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:02,650
assigns the mailing to someone else or

00:36:01,089 --> 00:36:04,089
moves it around to let them know like

00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:06,759
with a notification that it's time for

00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:08,019
them to go ahead and add the recipients

00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:09,819
to it and then we can trigger another

00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:11,380
rule that says all right now it's been

00:36:09,819 --> 00:36:16,690
approved we can go ahead and add it to

00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:17,979
the mailing q so we've got again these

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,529
are these are all pretty recent

00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:21,880
developments which is why I don't have

00:36:20,529 --> 00:36:24,279
them on my main site just on our demo

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:27,219
but the the web forum rules and views

00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:28,599
integration makes it so a really

00:36:27,219 --> 00:36:30,700
powerful module without you having to

00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,289
write a lot of code I mentioned kind of

00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:34,450
before the session started i've i've

00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:36,910
never written any code to customize

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:40,180
civvy because all these newer modules

00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:41,650
keep coming out and there's really

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,259
powerful integrations that lets someone

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:46,119
who's not uber techie be able to go

00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:48,539
ahead and and do some really advanced

00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:48,539
features

00:36:50,140 --> 00:37:02,480
so that's kind of my walkthrough I oh

00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:06,500
we're here oh my gosh all right before

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:12,430
it goes away so I wanted to show you the

00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:14,510
front end of an event registration

00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,800
because everything we've seen so far was

00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:19,579
back in really nothing on the public

00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:21,140
pages and all you have to do to make

00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:22,490
these pages live when you create an

00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:24,170
event or you create a membership or

00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,609
contribution page they're all based on

00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:28,880
you creating a page through running

00:37:25,609 --> 00:37:30,829
through their little wizard they give

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,900
you a link and then you just serve that

00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:34,070
link into your you know on your site

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,060
wherever you want it you know it's

00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:37,400
probably going to be something in your

00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:45,640
primary menu or a link to it from a page

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:45,640
somewhere come on smalls

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:50,980
alright

00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:06,830
yeah i think the bm's host well um I

00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:10,310
think does this go to 11 that's all

00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:11,390
right how late how long is the session

00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:15,440
go like I wanted to see if there any

00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:17,510
other just general questions okay it's

00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,600
plenty of time all right well this tries

00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:21,950
to load um I did run it like I ran

00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,650
through most of the big things that it's

00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:38,480
done there that it has but yeah I want

00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:44,350
to just see what you guys have and now

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,350
web form a web form is the newest yep

00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:02,030
nope this is the live site right now is

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:04,730
sitting on this this website right here

00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:08,810
yeah so if i show my membership page

00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:10,220
this is going to show a civvie if we

00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:14,030
look up here you'll notice my girl is

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:16,520
going to change and you can't really do

00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:18,680
pretty girls with civvy which kind of

00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:20,450
sucks you can set up though with using

00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,570
the path module or the path redirect

00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:26,090
module you can give it a pretty pass for

00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,500
just the menu item yeah just so the end

00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:29,360
user sees that first but then it's still

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:34,910
going to push them to one of these civvy

00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:37,640
URLs so I'm looking on the membership

00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:38,840
page and it actually recognizes based on

00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,430
me being logged in that I'm already a

00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:43,670
member and I may want to do a renewal

00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:44,840
versus some kind of you know versus a

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:48,560
new membership maybe I don't know what

00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:50,210
my old level was and this was a profile

00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,670
that we just threw in at the bottom it's

00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:55,370
got three basic fields we wanted to

00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,380
collect the minimum of information to

00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:01,010
that we would need to actually process

00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,630
the membership while still not putting

00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:05,840
people off to to wanting to give us

00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:07,580
money there's nothing worse than getting

00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,780
those screens for you where they ask you

00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,770
for like 20 pieces of information

00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,490
and you're trying to give them a

00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:13,490
donation

00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:32,630
other questions about civvy or touch

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,630
points with drupal anything like that

00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,020
the question was on what kind of setup

00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,360
do you do on the drupal side when you're

00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,420
integrating with these things views

00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:53,790
requires editing a couple of pages for

00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,280
v's integration just because views

00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:57,870
doesn't know automatically where civvy

00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,830
is unless you're putting them in the

00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:03,870
same database which generally is not

00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:08,400
best practice to put your crm and CMS

00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:10,230
together but most of the others you just

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,270
turn on the module and if I go to the

00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:14,340
web form integration I create a new web

00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:17,310
form and I've got my little edit

00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:20,550
submissions table and now I've got a

00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:27,930
civvie CRM tab at the top for two they

00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:29,910
are rocking out and for these profiles

00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:32,610
I'll show you the profiles from this

00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:38,690
side because you choose where you want

00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:38,690
them to show up customized

00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:55,590
alright so if we look at this one right

00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:58,140
here you can choose specific grupal

00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:00,090
places just pick from a couple of check

00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:01,590
boxes here so I want it to be on my

00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:05,730
registration for more than my account

00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:06,870
form or if it's and then you're always

00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:12,180
going to check profile because you might

00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:14,030
want to export it somewhere else and I

00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:18,270
had mentioned which I want to show you

00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:24,450
you can put this anywhere so HTML form

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:25,980
snippet go here and I can just copy and

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:29,000
paste that into any web site anywhere

00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,320
and it's going to save into my co civvy

00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,380
database because there's an API that it

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:42,210
all runs through you can just do like

00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:43,530
basic rest api so there's other little

00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:47,040
widgets and cool things in here we've

00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:48,570
got like campaign goals where you can

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,860
set set a ten-thousand-dollar

00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:52,440
fundraising goal and watch the little

00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:57,480
thermometer get closer and do fun little

00:42:52,440 --> 00:43:00,210
stuff like that but that's pretty much

00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,620
civvy as much as you can get to it in an

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:10,260
hour with a half busted vm now this guy

00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:13,920
finally got there I did not mention team

00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:15,840
fundraising think of we've probably all

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,330
either been in one or had a friend who's

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,830
done team in training those like the

00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:22,590
cancer walks and saying things like that

00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:24,420
where it's helped me reach my goal of X

00:43:22,590 --> 00:43:26,400
number of dollars versus donate to the

00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,470
overall campaign so we've got that

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,660
ability here you can you can allow folks

00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,070
to create their own campaign pages give

00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,890
it their own messaging their own images

00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:37,830
kind of thing and then they're working

00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,810
towards personal or team goals which is

00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:42,630
another thing that you don't see many of

00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:45,480
the CRM systems doing yet some of the

00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:46,920
higher end ones have it but in terms of

00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:50,220
free ones I think this is the only one

00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,740
and I don't know any of like the lower

00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:55,040
tier proprietary CRMs that are doing

00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:55,040
that yet

00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:13,230
alright

00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:13,230
Oh any other elegant any other questions

00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:28,060
no all right let's hot City so thank you

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:30,099
all and if I can wrangle this vm if you

00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,599
just want to come around and ask

00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:36,010
questions or having me like demo a piece

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,270
to you personally I'm glad to I'm going

00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,660
to kill this thing afterwards and see

00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,660
what happens

00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:53,960
what about this I can help the like it

00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:58,090
we have the same problem or whatever

00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,090
other to do you think I power

00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:04,180
that's what the word out

00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:04,180
you

00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:20,060
webos nos that works the way that you do

00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:25,070
across all your devices HP Slate and

00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:27,710
whether less HP as a service leader in

00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:29,720
cloud computing all we do is hosted

00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,760
computing to us the cloud is just the

00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:32,750
next generation of hosting and if

00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,760
someone who's been in the hosting

00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,770
industry for 12 years we feel work in a

00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:38,060
unique position to really help bring

00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:40,070
these two worlds together these

00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,230
different sets of technologies and to

00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:44,630
help companies embrace this new world in

00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:46,970
this great new tool that allows faster

00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:48,980
innovation not only is it about us being

00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:52,060
