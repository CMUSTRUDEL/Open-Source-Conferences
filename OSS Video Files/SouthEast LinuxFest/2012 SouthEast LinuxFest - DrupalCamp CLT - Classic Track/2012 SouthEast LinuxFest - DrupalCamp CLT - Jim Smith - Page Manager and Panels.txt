the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:29,070
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,660
possible so i started to ask was how

00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,850
many people here know what I'm talking

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:37,290
about when I talk about page manager and

00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:40,469
panels just to just had this portion of

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:44,960
you okay so what the idea here is this

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:48,390
is not going to be an all-encompassing

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,719
training on page manager in panels we

00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:53,969
wouldn't will do that in an hour in fact

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,640
earlier this week I did a session on on

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,699
this very subject and it was close to

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,379
three hours and we didn't even cover all

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:05,970
of it so didn't come close in fact so

00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:08,820
but at least the idea here is that

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,350
you'll get an idea of what it is what it

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:16,500
can do and why you might want to

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:18,150
consider it as you build sites so you

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,240
know what I just realized that what I

00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,570
forgot to do in this session was add in

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,070
some slides about myself so let me jump

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,720
in a little bit about that my name is

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,549
Jim Smith and I am the director of

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:36,720
online media at a TV station in

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:41,430
Knoxville Tennessee wate the website

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:46,200
that is the main news site for wate is

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:48,600
not a Drupal site and it is actually a

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,360
site that was built in a closed

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:58,649
proprietary system that we hire a vendor

00:01:51,360 --> 00:02:02,610
to maintain for us and it's this that

00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:05,040
was doing that sorry it and it was for

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,509
that very reason that I started looking

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,489
for an open source content management

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:13,590
system that i could put on my own server

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:15,540
and what the idea was was to just two

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,519
build pages that look like my site but

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,519
would let me do things that I couldn't

00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:22,319
in that closed system and after trying a

00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:26,190
few different content management systems

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,450
I I actually went back to Drupal because

00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:29,069
Drupal was one of the first ones that I

00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,879
had tested and I didn't like it but that

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:35,849
this was back version 4.5 or something

00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:39,750
like that and it that version was very

00:02:35,849 --> 00:02:41,879
hard to install since then it's they've

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,840
made a lot of they had made a lot of

00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,880
changes when I tried it again it was

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,310
actually I could see the benefits of

00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,650
using drupal and and I've been using it

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:57,379
ever since not just in mimicking the

00:02:52,650 --> 00:03:02,730
site of the TV station but in doing some

00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:05,730
one-off type sites and then a few years

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:08,849
ago I started doing freelance work and

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:12,030
so I can't serve a side business where I

00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:15,660
do freelance site building and also

00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:18,239
training so what we're going to talk

00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:21,329
today about as I said it's panels and

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,380
page manager and so maybe if some of you

00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:28,380
have heard Drupal compared to Legos and

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:33,530
I think it's an apt comparison if you

00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:38,730
think about all the Legos is you have

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:41,280
these interlocking blocks the that that

00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:43,230
in and of themselves don't do a lot but

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,000
when you add them all together in the

00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:46,950
right combination you can make some

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,040
incredible things and some of those

00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,269
blocks are really specialty things you

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,970
know like the little characters and

00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:55,980
things that they only have maybe one

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,200
used to them but some of them are very

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,120
generic and they have multiple uses and

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,230
it all depends on how you put them

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,370
together I found this quote that was

00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:12,180
part of a discussion at drupal.org that

00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:19,079
I think speaks well to it and one of the

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:22,289
things though is that monette Drupal is

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:25,250
hard to learn sometimes and it takes

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,650
time to learn the pieces but

00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,830
if you play with it you can get a lot

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,830
out of it and you can learn a lot so

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:41,720
sometimes though it seems like all it is

00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:45,380
is just a jumbled mess so what work one

00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,500
of the things about Drupal is if you if

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:53,210
you break it down into the different

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:58,220
parts it helps a lot so the do you

00:04:53,210 --> 00:05:00,169
understand Drupal's structure there is a

00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,080
data model or the content which is

00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:06,320
stored in the database and then that

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,470
gets pieces of that get pulled in nodes

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,310
and in views to create the actual

00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:19,030
content display which is arranged by a

00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:22,600
layout and then on top of that is the

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:26,180
predication if you will of the the

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,470
content and that's did expressed a

00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,979
little bit more specifically by the

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:34,479
content types that Drupal uses to create

00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:38,060
the nodes then fields and views that are

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,880
combined together to display the nodes

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,700
and blocks and then of course you have

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,560
to have HTML and CSS to make it look

00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,090
like something on your site and that's

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:56,090
the basic idea of every Drupal site now

00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:59,810
a lot of that is being done at the theme

00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:01,370
layer and the this is just a kind of a

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:02,570
basic understanding of what we're

00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,940
talking about when we're talking about

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,280
theme is that it's a combination of a

00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,080
lots of things but it's it's managing

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,050
the layout and design elements of

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:17,270
content and that's what theme is that's

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:19,790
the sole purpose typically in any Drupal

00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:22,250
site you're going to see these areas

00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:25,190
where you have content blocks a menu

00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:28,070
logo some of that is being managed by

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:32,690
the block system some of it's coming

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:37,220
from the the content output of either

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:38,520
the node or views and then you have in a

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:41,400
typical theme you have

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:47,190
specific calls to the menu and logos and

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:51,599
things like that then that all that is

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:53,580
being managed at the output of that is

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,750
controlled in the in terms of its layout

00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:00,000
and what have you by the theme so what

00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:02,069
we're going to do is we're going to talk

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,639
about something that adds a layer to

00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:09,620
this and that's panels and we'll get

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:15,810
into page manager as well but panels is

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:19,250
a contributed module that can manage all

00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:21,990
of the blocks nodes menus and forms and

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:27,690
provides a layout control that's that's

00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:30,539
beyond what the theme does then in a

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,469
normal panels installation you have

00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:37,560
you've taken the content area and you're

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:41,879
letting panels handle that whereas there

00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:46,530
are still elements of the there's still

00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:48,930
elements of the other regions of the

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,710
page that are being handled by drupal

00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:54,990
and so panels is just giving you

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,830
additional layout options within the

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:04,400
content area then there's something

00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:07,020
called panels everywhere which takes the

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,330
idea of panels and extends it to the

00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:12,779
entire page in fact what it does is it

00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:17,069
it overrides the core block system that

00:08:12,779 --> 00:08:21,900
Drupal uses and pretty much makes that

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:25,289
whole part of the Drupal site obsolete

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:32,070
so everywhere on the page if you will is

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:33,690
a a pane of the panels one other thing

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:35,820
that we have to talk about a little bit

00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:43,680
we're not going to get in-depth about it

00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:45,180
is views and views is I'm going to give

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,740
me one second I just realized that I

00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,350
forgot to do something here that I'm

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,820
going to need to before I get too far

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,510
along it won't be able to demo this if I

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,510
don't turn this on

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,839
let that run behind I'm sorry i just

00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:00,250
realized what the problems i have the

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:06,130
computer earlier that i forgot all about

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:15,339
oops go back to one moment please step

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:23,370
technical difficulties okay sorry about

00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:28,740
that so we were talking about views

00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:32,710
turns out that views module and panels

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:37,290
module and Paige manager and all that

00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:40,120
are all written by the same developer

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:46,560
his name is earl miles he goes by the

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:50,560
name Earl of kr Merlin of chaos and he

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,330
if you were in Ken rickards presentation

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,370
this morning is keynote this morning you

00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:59,709
heard mention of of Earl and the the

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:08,400
major contributions that he has made to

00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:12,760
Drupal what he did was he was able to

00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:15,750
create these well I'll get into that

00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:18,190
little later let me jump into this part

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,550
that's what we're talking about now is

00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:24,010
the themes and panels idea that we're

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:27,550
talking about a moment ago the

00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:30,820
difference is that panels does to the

00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:32,500
site compare it to themes you always

00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:34,870
have to have a theme panels never

00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,580
replaces the theme even when it's panels

00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,589
everywhere there is still you still have

00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,870
to have a theme is just that panels

00:10:38,589 --> 00:10:47,220
takes care of the layout parsh portions

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:49,390
of the the layout there are lots of

00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:52,870
logic that has to be written by the

00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:55,000
femur in a theme whereas almost all of

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,360
that is managed by the code inside the

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,810
module in panels so if you're not a

00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,680
coder you can still do some elaborate

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:09,760
things with managing the output of your

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,230
content without having to worry about

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:17,500
writing code and then one of the things

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,540
that the theme does is to divide up the

00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,029
content into different parts of the page

00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:25,600
but that requires lots of different

00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:29,740
files that if you every time you want to

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,740
have a particularly unique layout you

00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:35,320
have to have a new file and then you

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:38,160
times you have to write a digital code

00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:42,520
to manage when those files get used

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,959
whereas panels is able to do that as on

00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,360
its own so there when you're doing what

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:51,430
themes you you're just dealing with

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,950
straight code you don't have a user

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:56,770
interface that you can visualize that

00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:59,020
layout whereas panels is very visual as

00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:00,790
we'll see in a little bit you can see

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,750
how you can just place your panels and

00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:08,800
around around the page we do require

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:11,529
some programming language or knowledge

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,459
to be able to change layouts at least a

00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:16,800
little bit of PHP it's not a lot but you

00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:20,110
it's you have to use a little bit

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:24,279
whereas with panels you really don't

00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:26,740
have to know how to write code at all

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:30,430
although there are if you get really

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:32,170
elaborate you can run into some

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:36,150
situations where a little coating will

00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:39,279
help but it's not necessary and then

00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:41,770
you're still using the the core block

00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,680
system or in some cases if you choose to

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:50,079
you can use the context module to manage

00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:52,720
your blocks whereas with panels and

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:57,040
especially panels everywhere all the

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,170
regions can be managed so let's take a

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,180
look now comparison panels to the block

00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:06,520
system in Drupal 6 all blocks are

00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,589
rendered to even those that are not on a

00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,660
page and that's important distinction

00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,660
because that affects the

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,320
the amount of processing power that your

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,660
server needs to because it's what it's

00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:25,430
doing is it's rendering blocks even

00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:30,860
though they're not displayed if you have

00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:33,290
12 reasons on a page it it will want to

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:35,000
render those even though the specific

00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:37,069
display doesn't call for any blocks to

00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:43,370
appear on that now they fix that in

00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:48,980
Drupal 7 fortunately but in panels it's

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:51,860
never been an issue with using the block

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,389
system there is in Drupal a way to cache

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:55,550
blocks but it's basically an

00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:58,730
all-or-nothing situation where you can

00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,670
you turn on us setting in the

00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:04,790
configuration for caching blocks and you

00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:07,310
can you can do that but all the blocks

00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:10,149
are cached in the same manner whereas

00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:14,889
with panels there is a pluggable

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:18,829
mechanism that allows you to select when

00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:20,920
or where you want caching to take place

00:14:18,829 --> 00:14:26,029
and you can control the length of time

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,589
specific to each individual blog the

00:14:26,029 --> 00:14:30,529
other thing that panels does is it

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:33,740
provides a drag and drop method of

00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:36,889
moving content around the page so it is

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:39,560
very visual and it also allows for

00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:43,220
contextual control over those so you can

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:47,959
have certain parts of that page display

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:50,149
for certain users or only when other

00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:52,850
content is displayed on that page and

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:57,410
not others and it gives you a great deal

00:14:52,850 --> 00:15:01,370
of control over when and where and how

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:03,199
the content is displayed going back two

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,310
panels everywhere it extends it even

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:09,620
further as we said and it also pretty

00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:12,290
much eliminates the need for layout

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,350
files because although you still have to

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:18,050
have a basic theme page file you don't

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,500
need to worry about the other display

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,990
areas then there's something else that

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,020
comes with panels and that's called mini

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:30,740
panels it is essentially the

00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:36,020
idea that panels is except it can allows

00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:39,920
you to have a section of panels that are

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:40,910
embedded in other panels that if that

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:45,380
doesn't seem like a very good

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:48,500
explanation here's an example where this

00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:51,350
is a panels page and these are this is a

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:55,670
mini panel of three panes with that are

00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:58,580
embedded within the other panels that

00:15:55,670 --> 00:16:01,400
are and the nice thing about many panels

00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:03,620
is they can be reused throughout your

00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:07,430
site so you can do some really complex

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:09,320
kinds of layouts if you want because you

00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:13,060
the same kinds of layouts that you can

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:13,060
do in panels you can do in many panels

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:20,090
there is one basic problem with panels

00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:25,940
and that is that the the user interface

00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:29,390
for for using it is rather complex but

00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,800
it's only complex to start with when

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:34,250
you're first when you first get into

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,350
later on you'll see as you if you get an

00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,870
understanding of where the pieces are

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,920
it's no more complex than anything else

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:45,230
that Drupal has as I said there's one

00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:48,140
other part to all of this and that's

00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:53,980
called page manager and page manager is

00:16:48,140 --> 00:17:00,170
if you think of it it's just a way of

00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:01,750
managing page types and but we don't

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:04,670
want to confuse that with content types

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,110
so in fact just think of it as a

00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:11,270
redirect machine what it is is it it

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,339
value eights the settings on that you've

00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:18,339
given it and then decides whether that

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,339
is going to deliver the page or not

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:26,020
seatools is another module that Earl

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,520
miles wrote that and in fact that's what

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:33,590
page manager comes in and the reason why

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:39,470
CTools is its real name is chaos tools

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:43,080
as in Merlin of chaos the

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:45,179
seatools is really a way for him to be

00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:49,740
able to reuse code that he wrote for

00:17:45,179 --> 00:17:55,410
views in panels so you need see tools

00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:58,110
for either views or panel or do you need

00:17:55,410 --> 00:18:04,770
a pc tools refuse I do forgotten now

00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:07,620
yeah that's what yeah yeah that it's a

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:09,270
way of sharing some code that both would

00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:13,080
use anyway and rather than having to

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,790
duplicate it but see tools does a lot of

00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:18,059
other things it allows you to create

00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:22,230
custom content pains it allows you to

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:24,260
bolt export content and and these are

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:26,760
all independent of whether you're using

00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:29,669
one or the other and then there's

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:34,230
something called style Iser which is a

00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:38,130
way to create some settings for the

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:41,370
display of an area that can be then that

00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:44,940
can be reused over and over just by

00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:46,500
selecting that style I won't be getting

00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,260
into that any further than just

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,200
mentioning it here but it is something

00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:57,620
that is worth looking into if you get

00:18:52,200 --> 00:19:01,710
into panels so to help understand how

00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:04,740
page manager and panels work it's good

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:08,820
to first understand a little bit of the

00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,500
terminology one word that sometimes

00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,460
causes a little bit of confusion is

00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,620
variant it is the the settings that

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,250
determine whether or not the page is

00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:24,090
rendered so you can have lots and lots

00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:31,230
of variants but each one is set to

00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:34,650
determine a type of page or a portion of

00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,470
a page that you want to display the

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:39,120
thing to keep in mind about a variant

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:41,940
and this is the part that is in

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:44,549
particularly confusing is that what page

00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,830
manager does is it evaluates each

00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:52,530
variant in the order in which it is

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:59,130
stacked and so it then applies

00:19:52,530 --> 00:20:02,970
whatever it it it decides is the first

00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:07,470
one that a that will work if it pasts

00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:09,300
and then it it uses that variant here's

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,420
a little bit of a better way to explain

00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,850
that you have a page request page

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,740
manager checks to see if it's supposed

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:18,900
to be used on that page request it says

00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:21,810
uh huh I need to figure out how to

00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:25,020
display this page so it checks the first

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,360
variant and if the variant passes then

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:29,160
it renders the page but if it didn't

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,380
pass then it will check the next one and

00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:35,630
again the next one until it determines

00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:39,300
to to pass it so the difference is

00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:42,420
unlike some systems where it's

00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:44,760
cumulative it's it's an all-or-nothing

00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:47,640
this one failed so it's going to check

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:49,470
the next one and if this one passed it

00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:52,050
doesn't care about the rest and those

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,370
the variants are not nothing in those

00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:57,840
variants is used so that's the that's

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:03,270
the area where some people get a little

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:05,850
bit confused another part of setting up

00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,070
a variant is the selection rule it's a

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:13,500
filter to tell if the variance should be

00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:18,420
replied applied context is part of that

00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:25,710
selection rule it is a arbitrary way of

00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:31,230
selecting a single item on for for using

00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:36,060
that variant an argument is another way

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:38,130
of selecting it would be like adding a

00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,900
placeholder letter or a wild card if you

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:43,620
will if you're familiar with that idea

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:48,390
of an argument is taken from the URL

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:51,120
however like like this this is the

00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:55,500
argument and that little placeholder

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:57,930
allows you to say then that all users in

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:03,690
that path out like this was these were

00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:05,750
usernames you anything that that had a

00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:09,880
path like that would

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:09,880
it'd be accepted in that variant a

00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:17,570
relationship is another selection rule

00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:20,980
and it is taking any Content thats

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:25,910
related to the content that's being

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:29,510
considered by the variant so examples

00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:34,280
would be other articles written by it

00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:35,930
the same author or taxonomy terms that

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,590
are shared by the content that's being

00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:43,970
displayed then you could tie other

00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:44,900
pieces of the page together so now what

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:48,250
we're going to do is we're going to take

00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:59,660
a little bit of a closer look at how

00:22:48,250 --> 00:23:03,440
just a couple examples of page manager

00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:05,510
and panels what I have here is a dev

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:08,480
site that and what I've done is I've

00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:12,080
just eat through devel have added a

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,670
bunch of dummy content you may have seen

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:20,570
other demos that do that essentially the

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:28,040
same thing all these are are just just a

00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:30,910
a fresh install of of Fleming said going

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,910
off the screen there

00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:47,029
it's it looks fine over there but it's

00:23:42,389 --> 00:23:47,029
as well it's my problem is that it's

00:23:51,950 --> 00:24:06,630
this display is thrown off by the

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:10,049
projector yeah that's a little bit

00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:13,110
better okay so what we've got is just a

00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:14,820
bunch of content we've got I didn't

00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:18,840
really do anything fancy it's just

00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:21,389
either in Drupal 7 you've got articles

00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:24,179
and you've got basic pages I didn't add

00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:27,809
any new content types there the basic

00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:31,919
pages don't have images and they don't

00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:35,159
have the author identified the and they

00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:39,929
don't have taxonomy taxonomy displayed

00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:42,210
in the articles you've got taxonomy

00:24:39,929 --> 00:24:44,879
you've got images you've got the author

00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:53,039
displayed and then there's some comments

00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:54,870
for each each of those articles let's

00:24:53,039 --> 00:25:00,990
take a look at something else that I did

00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:03,980
here just so you'll have an idea I added

00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,980
a couple of views

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:20,490
one is I created a view that shows the

00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:27,150
articles of an author so it's just a

00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:32,430
basic list of of articles this and it

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:36,660
makes use of an argument right here's

00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:39,690
the argument for the author's user ID so

00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:45,870
that if we'll just select author number

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:49,470
four you can see that author number four

00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:52,620
wrote three articles so that what that's

00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:54,870
doing is that's creating a block you can

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:58,710
see that there then there is another

00:25:54,870 --> 00:26:02,040
view that is just a list of the most

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:08,670
recent comments and that is essentially

00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:13,980
just a default view that comes with

00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:16,350
views that I enabled so what we'll do

00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:20,640
first is we're going to use page manager

00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:23,880
and as I said page manager is just doing

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:28,260
some checking to determine whether a

00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:31,220
page should be rendered and if it should

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,220
be how it's going to give it some

00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:42,570
direction as to where it should be

00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:49,290
displayed we will go to pages which is

00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:51,360
the menu item for page manager right now

00:26:49,290 --> 00:27:00,060
when Pitt when when you install page

00:26:51,360 --> 00:27:06,720
manager you get some possible presets

00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:09,090
that are currently disabled and when if

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,000
you were to install panels everywhere

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,700
which is a digital additional module it

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,780
adds one more preset here and it's

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,760
called the default layout and in some

00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,559
cases you can do everything you want

00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,919
with that one default

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:32,480
layout and lots of variance so you don't

00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:39,629
necessarily even have to use these other

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:41,639
preset layout templates or not layout

00:27:39,629 --> 00:27:43,649
templates necessarily because this we're

00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:47,370
talking about page manager here they're

00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:51,809
about anyway templates so now we're

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:58,590
going to enable the node template as you

00:27:51,809 --> 00:28:03,299
see it's anything that has this path of

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:08,639
node and then the node ID is going to be

00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:13,799
considered by page manager now if we

00:28:08,639 --> 00:28:19,039
look at let's say we go to one of these

00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:24,210
nodes just by the mere turning on the

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:26,700
page manager didn't affect the the view

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:29,070
at all there's still the cut the node

00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,649
and then the comments that are after it

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,649
there's nothing that's that's changed

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:43,440
bye-bye that we're going to do now is

00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:44,999
edit this and you now see this doesn't

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,940
look so bad right now in its current

00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:50,460
form but if you start adding variants

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:52,049
and you have lots going on you can see

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,519
that this can become a very cluttered

00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:57,080
interface and that's what I was talking

00:28:53,519 --> 00:29:00,980
about when I was talking about the UI

00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,529
we're going to add a variant to start

00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:09,269
addressing how we want to manage this

00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:11,070
particular display let's just the title

00:29:09,269 --> 00:29:14,090
here is really just for administrative

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:17,809
purposes is just to help us and know

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:28,529
what what the purpose of this variant is

00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:29,850
we're going to redirect a I don't know

00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:31,980
yet which one that's going to be I'm

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:36,830
going to be very specific but we're

00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:44,600
going to redirect a an article

00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:48,720
to user page I already have panels

00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:51,030
module installed so it is showing up

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,220
there but we're going to use if I didn't

00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:55,980
if I didn't have panels installed and I

00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:59,400
just wanted to use page manager it would

00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:02,120
only give me the ability to do HTTP

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:06,480
response code which like I said is what

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:09,120
is is a redirect we have the option of

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:14,610
selecting selection rules and contacts

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:17,000
here but you don't even have to check

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:20,670
those off and still be able to use them

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,380
so there's really no point and i'm not

00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:24,870
sure why they do that since you can

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,630
always add those later okay so now we

00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:31,560
have to select what kind of response we

00:30:27,630 --> 00:30:33,390
want let's do a redirect and I don't

00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:35,370
have to fill this in yet I'm going to

00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:39,350
come back and fill this after I figure

00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:42,420
out what what it is that I'm redirecting

00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:47,090
but I'm going to create the variant so

00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:51,600
now a new area on this left side is

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:53,580
created by these are tabs created for

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,310
this variant and you can see that the

00:30:53,580 --> 00:31:06,840
name that I gave it is there and then

00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:09,930
some menu items the summary is well just

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:12,810
very just that it will display also here

00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:17,160
the path once we've if we dislike to

00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:19,440
give it a path so everything that we

00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:24,270
might want to know about a variant is

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:26,550
kind of displayed there this is where we

00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:29,310
entered that information in general now

00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:32,280
we go to the selection rules we're going

00:31:29,310 --> 00:31:40,230
to give it a context and as I said it

00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:42,120
context is a very specific sit so it can

00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,760
be it can be multiples of the same thing

00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,480
but it has to be very specific items

00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,480
let's

00:31:49,290 --> 00:32:13,350
let's select well try and remember how

00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:15,950
it what I did before let's say a context

00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,950
exists

00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:26,929
that so that what that means is now that

00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:32,470
we I've said a context to exist it

00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:36,020
creates a I tamir in the tab for

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:43,390
defining what that context is we're

00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:45,500
going to say that that context is a node

00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:55,160
again the context is something that's

00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:58,280
fairly specific so we're going to select

00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:11,360
a node let's select one that has an

00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:17,900
author oh come on or we could just

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:27,679
select a number we could say for I

00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:32,470
thought we could I'm not seeing what I

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:35,510
should be seeing here is ok here we go

00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:41,770
we're going to pick this this article by

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:41,770
kudi Joseph oops

00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,049
sorry

00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:14,119
hmm I guess wants me to there okay what

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:16,129
happens is that this modal that is that

00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,280
is being used for this this is also a

00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:23,869
part of C tulsi tools allows you to

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:26,030
create modal windows like that and so

00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:30,139
that's something that as developers we

00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:35,119
can reuse that code in other parts of

00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:39,470
our site so now let's select a

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:46,750
relationship we're going to choose the

00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:46,750
author of that node add the relationship

00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:56,830
one of the things that is also going on

00:34:53,740 --> 00:35:02,920
with variants and the the context here

00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:06,760
is that okay when I say this we have

00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:11,560
lots of options for tokens that we can

00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:20,500
apply so there is one right here that I

00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:27,310
want to use and now what I want to do is

00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:30,810
go up here to general and add what we

00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:40,080
didn't have before and that was the path

00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:40,080
user oh I thought I copy that

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,000
try adding in

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:08,250
now you notice that any time I don't

00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,500
know if those I'm going to just click on

00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:13,490
update rather than update and save you

00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,589
notice that right now this little

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:19,170
indicator is appearing in the corner and

00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:22,140
that tells you that you have not really

00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:24,240
saved your settings they are they're

00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:29,990
being stored but not stored in a way so

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:32,549
that they will be there if you were to

00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:35,339
leave the site so we want to make sure

00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:38,250
want to keep an eye on that and the

00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:40,799
basic rule of thumb is just use the

00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:43,950
update and save all the time you can

00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:48,059
always undo things but you can forget to

00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:50,040
save something if you're not careful so

00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:55,170
what we've done is we've created a

00:36:50,040 --> 00:37:00,809
redirect so that when this the specific

00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:03,299
page is being viewed rather than display

00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:06,990
that page it's going to display the

00:37:03,299 --> 00:37:09,150
users page instead I can't give you a

00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:15,150
specific use case in which that might

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:19,260
exist but Lilith we're just going to say

00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:21,930
that there is okay so let's go to let's

00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:28,730
go ahead and use a different it's fine

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:28,730
content if i remember right that was

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:45,400
node 56 I remember that was that guy no

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,470
at 56 so let's look at that and see what

00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:54,850
happens if we we get kicked instead to

00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:57,869
the user page but if we were to look at

00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,869
any other page

00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,790
Oh

00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:20,509
you

00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:23,109
it looks like well this is live

00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:23,109
television folks

00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:46,330
it should have been very specific to

00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:48,400
that one thanks Doug all right let's go

00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:56,680
back and take a look at our selection

00:38:48,400 --> 00:39:03,070
rules again the node being viewed should

00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:04,510
be okay oh it's it is a context and so

00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:08,320
then we going to take a look at the

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:16,650
context and the node should be a

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:16,650
specific node ah it is right there

00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:33,680
alright and the relationship should be

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:43,230
there okay something maybe I didn't save

00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:45,750
it did I not because it says unchanged

00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:49,800
and I haven't didn't think I changed

00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:53,540
anything ok says definitely save there

00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,540
now let's go back and see what happens

00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:16,770
to go to any page well this all worked

00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:20,690
right one it's kicking it's kicking all

00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:28,530
of them to the users page instead of

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:31,160
that specific one and I I'm honestly not

00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:31,160
saying why

00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:44,240
well I don't want to dwell on this too

00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,460
long but that I mean the least gives you

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:51,710
an idea of the basic idea of what page

00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:53,180
manager is supposed to do yeah so what

00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,650
I'm going to do is I'm going to delete

00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:55,609
that so it doesn't affect what we're

00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,660
going to do next because what we're

00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:59,900
going to do next is we're going to

00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:02,089
create a panel and a panel is again it's

00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:06,970
just taking page manager than to the

00:41:02,089 --> 00:41:12,800
next level where it's redirecting to a

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:16,460
layout instead of just to a particular

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,700
page as a page with a specific layout so

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:26,859
we're going to add a new variant and

00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:30,770
we're going to affect the article page

00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:33,230
and this is going to be a panel again we

00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:37,940
could select selection rules and context

00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:39,680
but we don't have to because we get

00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:46,430
still have the option of doing that down

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:48,349
the road here actually let's just let's

00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:51,849
go ahead and select them down we're

00:41:48,349 --> 00:41:51,849
going to select a selection rule

00:41:55,569 --> 00:42:09,779
and what that selection rule is is a

00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:09,779
node type article

00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:22,620
so what we're doing is any node that as

00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,240
an article is going to be affected by

00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:27,180
this new layout that we're going to give

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,120
it now here's where we get to the layout

00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:32,820
and this is where when most people think

00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,980
of panels this is what they think of is

00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,170
the actual being able to change the

00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,420
layout I'm actually going to rather I'm

00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:43,950
going to go with a two column layout you

00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:48,740
get out of the box you get lots of types

00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:52,500
of layouts some of them are multiple

00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:54,660
panes of in different columns and you

00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:57,570
also have the ability to create some

00:42:54,660 --> 00:43:06,150
custom ones as well I'm going to just go

00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:08,430
with the basic two column layout you

00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:13,140
also have the ability of giving specific

00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:17,160
CSS classes or even body body classes to

00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:22,860
the remove remover add body classes to

00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:26,820
your page you can add IDs and it even

00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:29,070
lets you add inline code although it's

00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,390
important to note that adding inline

00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:36,180
code is not considered a best practice

00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:38,520
it is a there especially if you need to

00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:40,820
make a quick fix or something on that

00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:40,820
page

00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:59,670
then also see oh I didn't say we get

00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:08,400
okay that's why it's not giving me

00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:08,400
create the variant there we go ok so now

00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:16,170
refreshing what we did was we selected

00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:21,869
that this layout will be for articles

00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:27,039
and we haven't given it any other

00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:32,710
selection rules like a context at this

00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:41,740
point so now we're going to add content

00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:48,010
to this panel and this is the user

00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:49,599
interface for panels right and you'll

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,750
see that over on this side there is

00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:56,020
little gear that we select to add

00:44:51,750 --> 00:45:01,859
content and when we select that it pops

00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:07,900
up a modal that gives us a vertical tabs

00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:10,650
to select from lots of different pieces

00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:14,049
of what would go into building a page

00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:17,289
just to take a look at one page elements

00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:20,890
would be especially used in if you are

00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:23,619
using panels anywhere where you wanted

00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:25,990
to have all of the surrounding elements

00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:29,440
like the header where you've got a logo

00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:33,309
let us perhaps a slogan or things in the

00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:36,339
footer your navigation and what have you

00:45:33,309 --> 00:45:40,119
you also have a separate menus tab which

00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:46,299
is the same idea that's pulling

00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:50,049
specifically from the menus a list that

00:45:46,299 --> 00:45:52,359
you've created within your site activity

00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:53,859
would be things like who's online these

00:45:52,359 --> 00:45:57,819
are things that have come out of the box

00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:58,599
with Drupal but there may also be other

00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,549
modules

00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:07,599
that are adding anything that Drupal can

00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:12,729
see gets winds up in this modal as

00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:14,589
options you can select in here where are

00:46:12,729 --> 00:46:17,829
all the elements that go into the node

00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:22,660
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:46:17,829 --> 00:46:24,369
select note content I don't need it to

00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:26,650
link to the node because what i'm going

00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:28,960
to do i'm not i'm talking about the full

00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:36,880
page so i'm going to change this bill

00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:39,069
mode to full content and we don't need

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,390
add comment links and read more links

00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:42,970
because we're still talking about the

00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:44,650
full page and there's nothing there's

00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,690
knows no other modules that are unable

00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,700
to create extra so it doesn't really

00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:57,579
matter whether we're using it there or

00:46:48,700 --> 00:47:08,440
not to select that and so now you see

00:46:57,579 --> 00:47:11,829
the that content the node content area

00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:15,700
has been filled in let's go ahead and

00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:19,989
add to that one other pain and that is

00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:25,930
the comments which are from the same

00:47:19,989 --> 00:47:29,799
place actually that was the wrong one I

00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:32,400
selected the wrong one I want the node

00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:32,400
comments

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,700
actually we should have the comment form

00:47:38,809 --> 00:47:44,900
shouldn't we otherwise be new people

00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:49,609
won't be able to add comments okay so

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:55,130
I'm going to add that and let's for that

00:47:49,609 --> 00:48:00,170
one let's say rather than the default

00:47:55,130 --> 00:48:08,019
the title of that is comments let's

00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:11,959
change that to make your voice heard

00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:16,190
just for fun he shows you the

00:48:11,959 --> 00:48:18,229
flexibility and well let's put the form

00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:21,709
above the comments so that week

00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:23,079
encouraged people to add comments you

00:48:21,709 --> 00:48:26,809
know see what all i did was i just

00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:28,849
grabbed that and dragged it to where I

00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:33,319
wanted it I could have also dragged it

00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:35,660
into another column over here we're

00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:37,849
going to add a couple the blocks that I

00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:42,140
talked about that we're being created by

00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:49,930
views and where we will find those in

00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:49,930
miscellaneous miss Elaine yes

00:48:51,099 --> 00:48:55,309
miscellaneous is kind of a catch-all

00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,799
place as you would expect from a name

00:48:55,309 --> 00:49:00,769
like miscellaneous but a lot of modules

00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:02,900
that create blocks walk there their

00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:10,209
blocks will show up in miscellaneous as

00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:14,930
well so we're going to select the

00:49:10,209 --> 00:49:22,660
articles by author and for now we're

00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:26,900
going to save that and then add another

00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:29,140
block from miscellaneous which is recent

00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,140
comments

00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:44,290
alright I'm going to save an update so

00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:46,420
what you see is we've laid out the

00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:51,250
portion of the page that is the content

00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:53,200
area we've added another column to that

00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:56,560
though so rather than the typical layout

00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:01,480
where you'd have to use the block system

00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:05,920
to display blocks we're using panels to

00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:09,730
add blocks to the page so now if we go

00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,920
to a page like this and this is not

00:50:09,730 --> 00:50:20,290
going to be the best one because it's

00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:23,100
got out such a large image but fresh

00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:29,290
that you can now see that we have added

00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:35,590
two blocks to that page and there are

00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:39,060
the comments and the comment form oh you

00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:39,060
know what I didn't realize this but

00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:43,150
apparently comments comes with so

00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:45,900
there's there's the one where we change

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,900
the make your voice heard

00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:57,160
now that is out of the box it says

00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:59,380
articles by this author however that

00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,269
right now those are I can tell you that

00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:06,460
those are not all the articles by this

00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:08,380
author because the author is whatever

00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:15,369
huh I'm not going to try to pronounce

00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:22,299
that but i'm pretty sure that no it is

00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:26,710
right okay i thought i needed to make a

00:51:22,299 --> 00:51:32,380
change but i didn't ok so let's let's do

00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:35,259
one other change to this layout that

00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:42,940
we've done we're going to go back to

00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:46,359
that back to the context here remember

00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:52,049
we had a bunch of tokens down here we're

00:51:46,359 --> 00:51:52,049
going to select node author

00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:58,930
go back to our content

00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:15,620
going to override this title and that

00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,660
finish

00:52:24,369 --> 00:52:27,749
they didn't save again

00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:42,210
and when we refresh this I get that

00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:42,210
header changed

00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:49,610
so that's the basic idea behind page

00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:52,570
manager and panels there's a lot more to

00:52:49,610 --> 00:53:00,200
it than that of course as you might be

00:52:52,570 --> 00:53:08,560
willing to presume and I guess now it's

00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:11,560
time for some questions answers jokes

00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:11,560
yes

00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:44,470
actually no it's not either orange in it

00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:51,770
okay yes absolutely the question is

00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:54,830
about views versus panels and does views

00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:56,720
replace panels or is it as views better

00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,880
than panels and actually I think that's

00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,040
a little bit of a misunderstanding

00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:09,050
because views is a different type of

00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:12,500
displays what views is is essentially

00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:16,820
just writing database queries it gives

00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:21,830
you an interface to do that so if you it

00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:24,530
then allows you to combine pieces of

00:54:21,830 --> 00:54:29,950
content together to create either blocks

00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:32,990
or pages whereas panels is a way of

00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:36,200
displaying in different regions of the

00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:39,770
page so the two work very well together

00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:42,230
as what I was really doing was that

00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:46,850
those two side blocks were created by

00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:48,620
views you don't have to have views to do

00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:50,690
panels and you don't have to have panels

00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:53,990
to views but the two of them worked very

00:54:50,690 --> 00:54:56,050
well together does that make sense is

00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,050
that

00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:08,459
yeah it views what one of the things

00:55:06,779 --> 00:55:13,319
that views will do will create full

00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:15,749
pages of lists and tables and you can

00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:18,929
also then use vuze to do things like

00:55:15,749 --> 00:55:23,699
slideshows and maps and so it's very

00:55:18,929 --> 00:55:26,509
flexible and it will and you can put

00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:29,309
that content in blocks but you can't

00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:31,499
very easily I mean views will even let

00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:34,829
you with with the views attached you can

00:55:31,499 --> 00:55:37,559
actually attach in different parts of

00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:41,880
the page you can and end some layout

00:55:37,559 --> 00:55:44,660
tricks you can get get that organized so

00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:47,849
that views is doing a lot of that but

00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:53,160
panels is so much more in terms of being

00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:55,229
able to affect not just what views can

00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:58,890
see but every part of what Drupal can

00:55:55,229 --> 00:56:06,269
see in your layout views cannot see some

00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:11,729
things in Drupal it it it can see what

00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:14,130
are called what first class is first

00:56:11,729 --> 00:56:19,319
class what they call that content

00:56:14,130 --> 00:56:21,719
elements it can see nodes and and and

00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:24,630
and basically what's in a node and

00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:28,429
that's and it can see users and it can

00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:31,619
see taxonomy but views cannot see blocks

00:56:28,429 --> 00:56:34,919
so you can't create a view of blocks it

00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:36,929
can't you can't create a view of menu

00:56:34,919 --> 00:56:42,809
items you can create a menu with views

00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:45,439
but you can't create at least that's

00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:49,409
been true up till now I think as as

00:56:45,439 --> 00:56:53,239
Drupal 7 brings in the idea of entities

00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:56,219
than that that that becomes more blurred

00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:59,969
whereas panels it will see everything

00:56:56,219 --> 00:57:03,449
that Drupal can see and you can move it

00:56:59,969 --> 00:57:07,349
around at will and slide it around and

00:57:03,449 --> 00:57:10,849
it's very visual so that's really the

00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:10,849
big differences

00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:13,640
yes

00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:36,819
if you're using panels everywhere panels

00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:39,190
everywhere is another module it doesn't

00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:47,500
get shipped with I don't think it gets

00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:49,800
shipped with panels and it is it's

00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:54,730
dependent on panels as you might expect

00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:58,960
and so it also requires a little bit of

00:57:54,730 --> 00:58:03,910
a change in your theme so that the you

00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:10,030
are using a theme that has eliminated on

00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:13,150
its own placing any regions for blocks

00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:15,579
to go in and for menu items to go in I

00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:16,869
mean you actually you could do both if

00:58:15,579 --> 00:58:18,790
you wanted but you're kind of defeating

00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:20,710
the purpose of panels everywhere if you

00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:24,190
do that so essentially what you're

00:58:20,710 --> 00:58:28,180
creating your your your template for the

00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:31,750
layout is just the the wrapper for the

00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:34,710
page and then panels everywhere manages

00:58:31,750 --> 00:58:34,710
everything inside it

00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:46,590
no longer not what once you put a turn

00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:49,230
on panels that they don't that that

00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:52,440
whole idea is no longer because the

00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:55,110
block system is not being used and it's

00:58:52,440 --> 00:59:00,060
the issue is the the regions that are

00:58:55,110 --> 00:59:10,430
declared in the template not so much the

00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:10,430
block system itself other questions yes

00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:27,900
no i don't i think there are ways in

00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:35,610
which you could include the well there

00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:38,460
are it seems like there are ways well

00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:41,240
you can do multiple arguments you can

00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,240
have you can have

00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:50,410
I don't

01:00:55,420 --> 01:01:03,430
oh well wolf one thing I didn't mention

01:01:00,099 --> 01:01:05,200
this but panels lets you reuse blocks

01:01:03,430 --> 01:01:06,790
multiple times on the same page if you

01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:13,150
want and the block system will not let

01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:14,319
you do that I think that but I don't

01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:19,420
think that really gets at what you're

01:01:14,319 --> 01:01:21,460
asking I didn't quite follow exactly how

01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:25,470
that page is laid out but I think that I

01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:29,619
think if you're if you're real

01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:32,799
relationships in your context erm years

01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:39,430
your selection rules are laid out right

01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:49,230
i don't i don't think you would I don't

01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:49,230
think you would need an or statement ok

01:02:14,789 --> 01:02:22,349
okay well remember that the the the

01:02:18,160 --> 01:02:25,059
argument is coming from the URL so in

01:02:22,349 --> 01:02:44,829
are you you're talking about different

01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:46,779
pages of okay okay so okay I got you

01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:49,539
well you what you would do then it sound

01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:52,210
I'm following you now so what you'd

01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:56,079
really do is you'd have two variants one

01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:58,749
would be specific to the path and the

01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,809
other would be say specific to like a

01:02:58,749 --> 01:03:10,170
content type or whatever that's then

01:03:01,809 --> 01:03:10,170
using the relationship that yeah yeah

01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:41,760
yep and one thing I didn't really get

01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:43,890
into I was trying to get everything make

01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,350
sure I got him within an hour but you

01:03:43,890 --> 01:03:48,870
are able to set individual settings

01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:50,880
within those pains even though your

01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:55,830
variant maybe for a whole page you can

01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:59,970
you can set a a say like a permissions

01:03:55,830 --> 01:04:01,290
based setting on a one particular pain

01:03:59,970 --> 01:04:05,960
where everybody can see the whole page

01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:05,960
but only certain people with a certain

01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:12,800
role can see that particular pain in it

01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:29,340
yes the pains are the individual pieces

01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:35,100
within the region's clear as mud any

01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:39,720
other questions and I'm sorry about the

01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:41,640
error on on my page manager demo I shows

01:04:39,720 --> 01:04:43,380
you what happens when you try to make

01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:44,700
last-minute adjustments in your

01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,000
presentation at two o'clock in the

01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:47,000
morning

01:05:27,739 --> 01:05:34,529
how's that sigh every way this is the

01:05:31,230 --> 01:05:36,720
way to better utilize all your resources

01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:40,170
and it makes managing all your resources

01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:43,999
pretty easy all of the innovation is

01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:47,519
happening in open source the

01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:49,289
collaborative nature and of the you know

01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,239
of the community and and the speed at

01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:53,130
which these are these you know these

01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:55,259
these deficiencies these bugs are

01:05:53,130 --> 01:05:57,869
getting discovered and then fixed is the

01:05:55,259 --> 01:06:01,019
thing that really shows the power of the

01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:02,670
of the open source community it is

01:06:01,019 --> 01:06:06,869
global and it's definitely because of

01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:13,200
the users community people are extremely

01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:14,940
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:16,369
go an entire see any day you'll see

01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:18,509
these guys helping each other out and

01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:21,420
they're all doing it like in a selfless

01:06:18,509 --> 01:06:23,249
manner the product is transparent for

01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:27,450
everyone everyone can look at the code

01:06:23,249 --> 01:06:29,460
base everyone can see how growth dark is

01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:35,339
being built nothing nothing is

01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:37,980
proprietary everything is open in many

01:06:35,339 --> 01:06:42,180
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:45,960
ongoing health I'll stack the most

01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:49,750
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:52,510
was our first developer boot camp

01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:55,150
and our call gave people like maybe two

01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:59,110
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:06:55,150 --> 01:07:03,340
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:06,130
with 87 people and had to go get board

01:07:03,340 --> 01:07:08,650
chairs in the room twice everything

01:07:06,130 --> 01:07:11,890
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:14,980
is open source and so I don't think that

01:07:11,890 --> 01:07:16,720
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:07:14,980 --> 01:07:19,750
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,300
computing and so i think it's i think

01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:23,830
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:24,940
about cloud computing you're really

01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:30,490
talking about open source cloud

01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:33,520
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:35,650
for large deployments you'll have dozens

01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,940
of data centers and thousands of servers

01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:42,610
in each data centers these hardware is

01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:46,090
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:07:42,610 --> 01:07:48,790
to handle number one that mass scale

01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:51,970
number two it's designed to handle the

01:07:48,790 --> 01:07:54,820
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:07:51,970 --> 01:07:59,050
deployments started working on cod tech

01:07:54,820 --> 01:08:02,320
over four years ago and it was the

01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:04,090
original set of people working on it had

01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:08,200
a background of delivering software

01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:12,430
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:16,060
lots of users actually using it high

01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:19,120
availability is the key feature multiple

01:08:16,060 --> 01:08:21,130
hypervisors support different network

01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:23,830
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:26,080
you better while step management server

01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:29,770
can be deployed in different physical

01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:31,420
machines it definitely has a huge

01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:35,780
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:38,450
there's a major movie studio that

01:08:35,780 --> 01:08:41,960
they were using CloudStack they were

01:08:38,450 --> 01:08:43,490
using it to transcode video and i

01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,470
thought that was terribly fascinating

01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:47,540
what i found more fascinating is what

01:08:45,470 --> 01:08:51,260
they did during lunch where they would

01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:52,730
spin up you know 50 or 60 game servers

01:08:51,260 --> 01:08:54,560
then as soon as lunch was over they

01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:57,230
would destroy all the instances and get

01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,870
back to doing real work cloudstack is

01:08:57,230 --> 01:09:01,550
vast it touches so many different

01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:03,410
aspects and there's no one person that's

01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:07,070
kind of like a master of all those

01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:09,950
realms I think CloudStack as a project

01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:12,230
is going to be one of the leaders simply

01:09:09,950 --> 01:09:17,330
because it's some of the most feature

01:09:12,230 --> 01:09:21,440
fallen and and robust platforms out they

01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:23,920
were out on seeing your limits of the

01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:23,920
clouds dag

01:09:36,699 --> 01:09:38,759
you

01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:47,190
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:49,140
ago we could not have imagined that

01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:51,330
asterisk would not only become the most

01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:53,490
widely adopted open source communication

01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:55,530
software on the planet but that it would

01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:58,050
impact the entire industry in the way

01:09:55,530 --> 01:10:00,030
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:02,640
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:04,620
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:06,690
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:08,100
transition of power from the hands of

01:10:06,690 --> 01:10:10,380
the traditional proprietary phone

01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:12,780
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:14,700
administrators of phone systems using

01:10:12,780 --> 01:10:15,930
this power our customers have created

01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,880
all sorts of business changing

01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:19,740
applications from small office phone

01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:22,260
systems to mission-critical call centres

01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:23,850
to international carrier networks in

01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:25,650
fact there's even an entire country

01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:28,020
those communications infrastructure runs

01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:30,150
on Astra's the gym has always been about

01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:31,860
creating technology that expands

01:10:30,150 --> 01:10:34,050
communications capabilities in ways that

01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:35,250
we could never have imagined and that's

01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:37,620
part of what's game-changing about

01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:40,320
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:10:37,620 --> 01:10:42,420
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:44,550
IP phones that extends control of the

01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:46,290
user all the way to the desktop the

01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:48,000
launch of these new products represents

01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:50,010
the next phase indigenous history of

01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:52,500
innovation these are the first and only

01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:54,210
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,890
power of esters when we first discussed

01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:57,810
our expectations for building a family

01:10:55,890 --> 01:10:59,970
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:01,710
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:10:59,970 --> 01:11:03,330
the team to build the phones such that

01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:05,520
they were easy to install integrate

01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:07,380
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,930
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:11:07,380 --> 01:11:11,580
that goal user feedback is validating

01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:13,680
that when it comes to operation with

01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:16,110
astro space systems including our own

01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:18,690
Switchvox based product these are the

01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:19,980
easiest to use best integrated most

01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:22,590
interoperable products on the market

01:11:19,980 --> 01:11:24,560
today the Digium family of phones will

01:11:22,590 --> 01:11:26,670
initially include three IP des hommes

01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,560
uniquely designed to complement any

01:11:26,670 --> 01:11:30,450
asterisk or Switchvox based solution

01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:33,120
these phones are different for a number

01:11:30,450 --> 01:11:35,760
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:37,200
designed for use with asterisks secondly

01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,810
we've made it really easy to

01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:41,190
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:11:38,810 --> 01:11:42,870
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:44,820
to access information inside of

01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:46,820
asterisks allowing tight coupling

01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:48,810
between an application and the phone

01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,970
additionally we've created an

01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:53,070
applications engineer that allows users

01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:56,310
and developers to create and run their

01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:58,080
own apps on the phone and finally we've

01:11:56,310 --> 01:12:00,060
done all of this at a very compelling

01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,710
price point at digium we're always

01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,810
thinking of ways to give our customers

01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:06,330
the best value in business phone systems

01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:07,950
and also give them the power to create

01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:10,080
their own solutions or any

01:12:07,950 --> 01:12:11,820
communications challenge well continue

01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:13,230
to push the boundaries not only to make

01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:15,300
Astra's cooler faster and more

01:12:13,230 --> 01:12:17,040
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:19,590
asterisk and communications even easier

01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,730
and together we'll change the way the

01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:22,730
