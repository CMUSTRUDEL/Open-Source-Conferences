00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:32,099
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:33,540
possible a few more come on in so I'm

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:35,460
going to talk to you guys about drush

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,780
today and I know you've probably had a

00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,790
lot of information thrown at you today

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:41,579
and this probably isn't the best topic

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:43,649
to have at the very end but I'm going to

00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:46,590
try and keep it quick and shorten to the

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,620
point my name is Paula Inga I'm from

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:52,440
Raleigh North Carolina and part of a the

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,980
triangle Drupal users group been using

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,390
Drupal about two and a half years and

00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:59,640
drush I was something that I haven't

00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,280
used for a really long time and I was

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,880
really excited to talk about it because

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:07,470
it's a really really powerful tool and

00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,420
if those you out there that aren't as a

00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:11,520
techie and not as comfortable with the

00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,619
command line it's still something that I

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,330
really would highly recommend learning

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,360
because it's really going to speed up

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:21,390
your speed up your development process

00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,640
and your Drupal just basic tasks that

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,509
you do on a regular basis and I actually

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,490
I worked for a company called

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,400
eClinicalWorks we do electronic health

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,820
records software we're not a Drupal shop

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:35,000
but we use Drupal a lot internally and

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:37,560
hopefully we'll keep using it even more

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,340
so what we're going to talk about today

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,130
or before I do that let me just quick

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,600
get a sense for the audience so who

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,710
knows what dresses in this room they

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,119
probably heard it mentioned a lot today

00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:54,540
okay good most of you and then how many

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:57,299
of you have used rush before okay so

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,420
only one hand okay so good or two all

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,689
right and then who's comfortable using

00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,479
the command line all right cool most

00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,220
people in here and then how many of you

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,800
been using drupal for less than a year

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,940
roughly all right perfect all right so

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,120
you guys are really you know kind of

00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,220
what I had in mind

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,709
for an audience so this is this should

00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,000
be great and yet I hopefully I'll be

00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,970
able to sell you guys on why you should

00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,760
use drush during this time what I'm

00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:27,099
going to talk about is really really

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:29,769
quickly is basically what is drush and

00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:31,780
why I use it and hopefully why you

00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:33,640
should use it as well I'm going to

00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,099
really quickly go through how to install

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,090
drush I'm not going to go step by step

00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:38,920
on this there's a lot of great

00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,180
documentation out there want to point

00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,579
you to a video that takes you through

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:44,799
step-by-step how to do it it would take

00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:47,019
a little more time so I'm just going to

00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,910
give you some reference on that a few

00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:50,890
steps that you have to do to installed

00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,060
rush and then what most of the time is

00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,510
going to be is it's going to be a demo

00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,769
of Josh so I'm going to demonstrate some

00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,200
different command some of the big

00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:01,000
commands that you can use with drush and

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,930
we're going to focus on that and I'll

00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,909
try and leave a little time at the end

00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:09,069
for questions for you guys as well too

00:03:05,909 --> 00:03:12,489
so what is josh Josh it basically stands

00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:13,620
for the Drupal shell so most you in here

00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:16,299
are familiar with the command line

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,380
probably most likely bash or the born

00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:22,720
again shell in the way that drupal.org

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:25,599
on the project page that they define it

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,150
is just rushes of command line shell and

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:30,940
scripting interface for Drupal so it's

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:34,410
not like a normal drupal module that's

00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:37,120
one very important thing to realize with

00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:39,400
with Josh so it's something that works

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,480
with like all versions of Drupal Drupal

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,519
6 7 and 8 you install it once on your

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,379
server or on your local machine for

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,810
example and you can use it with many

00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:51,099
different sites it's not like a bunch of

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,500
a lot of the modules you've looked at

00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,180
today like views features I know there's

00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,449
a session on that where you got to

00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,230
install it and each site but but this is

00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:01,239
something that you're going to install

00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,060
on your your local machine or on your

00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,829
server and the one thing that's really

00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,650
great about Russia's the documentation

00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:14,049
is really good it's a big reason that I

00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:16,930
would recommend using it as well and

00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:18,099
then why used rush what are these are

00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,199
kind of the main reasons that I used

00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:23,620
rush the main one is module management

00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,740
as you start using Drupal trying out

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,289
modules upgrading

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,780
installing updating and installing

00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:33,910
modules it can save you just so much

00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,110
time I especially the more modules

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:37,060
having a site the more time it's going

00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,830
to save you but I know for me when I

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,300
first start using Drupal I'd go up to

00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:44,500
the project page I download it unzip it

00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,150
uploaded on ftp it was just you know

00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,490
very time consuming and then go and the

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:52,330
GUI enable the module Josh you can do

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:54,130
that in 12 very short commands and then

00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,690
lastly what I use it for a lot is

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,539
performing just routine tasks such as

00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,490
backup being either it works really well

00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:02,800
at the back up in my great module those

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,020
of you that are familiar with that you

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,680
can do a sequel dump through it just

00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,909
take a backup of your sequel database

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,979
and clearing the Drupal cash run you

00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:13,840
that our developers in here that's

00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,659
probably the one command you're going to

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,569
use the mouth CC which I'm gonna show

00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:20,949
you in a little bit rccl you'll loved

00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,050
rushed for that because it going through

00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:24,819
the GUI to do that it can be kind of

00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:29,380
time consuming especially when you do it

00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:31,180
many times a day so Josh installation as

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,550
i said i'm just going to basically give

00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,330
you the three steps that you have to do

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:39,210
the project page as i mentioned before

00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:44,280
previous slide it's just drupal.org /

00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:46,509
project / drush let me just open that up

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:50,860
so that's the first thing that we want

00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:54,219
to do in right on that drush page if i

00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:57,370
scroll down to the recommended releases

00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:59,349
so you can see we're up to five dot for

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,620
it does have the version 7 in front of

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:04,990
it but it works with version 6 version 8

00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,610
so the five dot 4 is really the core

00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,180
version of josh the most up-to-date

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,340
version of that there is that there are

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:14,680
some instructions on here but where l

00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:18,400
point you to is under this miscellaneous

00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:20,139
here there's this dress org site and

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,750
this is kept up by the people who

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,900
maintained rush really excellent

00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:28,360
resource the FAQ and the commands are

00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,530
all listed here by a version number i'm

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,449
going to reference this later in the

00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,810
presentation but those are going to be

00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:37,300
to the places that you want to heaven as

00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:38,800
a reference on a regular basis so the

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,700
first thing would be just the download

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,640
rush

00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,480
on your server on your local machine

00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,910
then we wanna make it make sure it's

00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,070
executable then lastly you're going to

00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:49,450
just create a symbolic link or update

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,180
your path variable i usually do the

00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,680
symbolic link you can do either one but

00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:56,170
basically it just allows you to type

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,170
drush anywhere in the command line and

00:06:56,170 --> 00:07:00,730
it's going to execute drush this video

00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:03,700
that's right here I would highly

00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:05,170
recommend this just you after you you

00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,360
get back and if you have an installed

00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:09,400
rush before it's on the Drupal ize

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,400
website which is a paid site but this is

00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,080
actually a free video they do it's like

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,780
a 15 minute video of like really slow

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,640
step by step with installation so if you

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,570
haven't installed it before check that

00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,030
out there I know there's some other

00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:25,660
videos as well but that was when I found

00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:27,370
very useful all right so enough of me

00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:31,480
doing slides it's actually see how this

00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:33,670
works and you can run on a Windows

00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:36,670
machine right now but you can run it on

00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:38,140
windows since Josh five but I really

00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,690
don't like running it on window so I'm

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:42,670
actually going to switch over to 4am on

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:44,050
VirtualBox I have a virtual machine

00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:47,290
running here something too I'm running

00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:50,620
you blew into linux so let me just sign

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:55,090
on here I'm just going to open up my

00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:58,000
command line all right great can you

00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:01,900
guys see that ok up in the back all

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,460
right great okay so i just have um yeah

00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,420
you've been to up here have some test

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:09,100
sites i'm just going to be running off

00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:11,830
my my local machine and if I just going

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:13,090
to first like one of the first things

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:15,640
that I always do if i if i'm logging

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:17,920
onto a server or a new machine and I

00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,490
want to see if drush is installed you

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,410
can simply just typed rush and if it's

00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,300
installed it's going to spit out this

00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:27,850
long list of command of all these

00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,080
different commands right here so that's

00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:31,570
a really quick way if you want to see if

00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:33,970
Drucker's installed you can type it from

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,919
any any place on the on the command line

00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:37,990
as long as you don't you've done that

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,660
symbolic link or update your path

00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:42,460
variable so just typing drush will do

00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,620
that I'm just going to clear that and

00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:47,410
I'm just going to type status this is

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,840
another basic command that I just use a

00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:51,010
lot to you if I wanted to see if it if

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,560
it's installed and I want to see what

00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:56,410
drush version is installed on this mess

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,029
on the server in this case I have five

00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,580
point four which is the the most recent

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:03,400
version it also is going to show me

00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:05,160
where my PHP configuration file is so

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:07,330
that's kind of handy as well use that

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,400
and I'm going to come back to this dress

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:10,630
status later when i'm actually in a

00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,320
drupal root directory it's going to give

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:16,089
me some more information but let me go

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,290
to my web root so I have some sites here

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:24,790
and my weber here is just just changing

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:27,240
the directory VAR w w or 3 w's and i'll

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:31,810
just list all my files here so i have a

00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,640
few Drupal sites up here now i'm just

00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:36,430
going to change into one of those drupal

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,730
roots so i think if i remember right i

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:41,130
think the test one is what i want so i'm

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,720
just going to go into that directory

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:50,529
oops alright so now i'm in my tests and

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,490
now if i do that drush status again so

00:09:50,529 --> 00:09:54,190
now you can see i get a little more

00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,790
information so i get the right from the

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,170
command prop i get the database username

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,600
the name of the database on there as

00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:05,010
well just tell me that it can connect to

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,600
the database again the PHP configuration

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,130
also what Drupal virgin I'm running just

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,030
I find this handy sometimes too if I

00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,610
want to just make sure I'm on the right

00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:15,100
site because I have some Drupal 6 and

00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:17,530
seven sites just really cooks gives me a

00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:22,060
high-level snapshot of what version I'm

00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:24,550
on so that's what the dress gasps does

00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,700
when i'm in a root directory or a drupal

00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:29,800
root directory and same thing again if I

00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,510
just did rush it's going to spit all

00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:34,810
those commands as before that doesn't

00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:37,180
change alright so now now I want to get

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,650
a module so I mentioned before you know

00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,930
when I first started using Drupal and

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:43,270
using the GUI you I go to the product

00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,530
page i downloaded I'd unzip it have to

00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:47,020
upload it in the sites all modules

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,810
folder it's a time-consuming process

00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:52,390
especially when you're doing a lot of

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:54,670
modules so what you can do instead if I

00:10:52,390 --> 00:11:01,540
go to a module project page so I'm just

00:10:54,670 --> 00:11:03,040
going to go to the flag module page and

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:05,700
hopefully my internet's working and it

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,700
was going too slow

00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:16,410
let me see okay so I came up so what I'm

00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:18,180
going to do to actually download this is

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:20,460
the command it's just going to be drush

00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,460
it's going to be dl for download and

00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:25,230
then when I the module that I want to

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,760
specify I'm just going to take the

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,320
machine name of that module which is

00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,510
basically what comes after project so

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,920
flag you know it's pretty simple it's

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:35,100
just flag some some of the other ones

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,560
like views bulk operations or backup in

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,790
my grade like fuse block operations i

00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,860
always think as vbo but it's actually

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:42,950
views underscore bulk underscore

00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,110
operations so you have to type that

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:48,590
exact when you're downloading it so let

00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:52,380
me go back to my command prop prompt I

00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:55,050
dude rush dl and that's for download and

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,310
I'm gonna do flag and this is going to

00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,780
take a little bit longer than normal my

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,930
the internet here is pretty slow a time

00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:03,870
on it would already be done if I was at

00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,640
home or at the office but but the great

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,590
part about this too is I mentioned

00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,720
before I'm on Drupal 6 and seven sites

00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:11,850
it automatically is going to you

00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,770
download the latest release of whatever

00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:15,440
version of Drupal core I'm on and it's

00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:18,600
going to put it in that sites all

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,620
modules folder okay so there we go so

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,990
again that took a little longer than

00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,320
usual it probably normally be under five

00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:26,730
seconds and this one downloaded two

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,920
modules so flag if you download it

00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:31,980
actually comes with to the flag actions

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:34,260
in the flag module now I need to enable

00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,430
that so in the past you know what I

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:41,100
would have done I would have went to my

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:43,320
my browser I'm on localhost here so I'm

00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,920
just going to go to test I'd have to go

00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:49,320
to my modules page click on it update it

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,490
click Save but now what I can actually

00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:58,350
do is just you'd rush enable and you've

00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:01,440
in EN is short for enable ND flag and

00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:03,170
it's going to just prompt me make sure I

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,190
want to do it i'm going to click yes

00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:08,160
alright so now that's that's been

00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:10,560
enabled and one thing i didn't mention

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,360
is the Doctore i did mention earlier but

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,670
i haven't showed you and this is if i

00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,460
want to see a command by the

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,910
documentation for it like just like with

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,040
the

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,850
a shell or many other shells that you've

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:26,670
used before it has great instructions

00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:29,850
right built into it so for example that

00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:31,680
the deal for download if I wanted to

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,650
look up what my options were that if I

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,010
if you typed right sorry drush help and

00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:40,710
a deal this is actually going to spit

00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:43,340
out different options that I can pass

00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:45,570
through it it's also going to give me

00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:49,800
let me scroll up so this one has quite a

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:50,850
few options yeah so here we go so it's

00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,300
actually it's going to tell me what it

00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:56,130
does and then it's going to give me an

00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,090
example of how to actually do it so I

00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,920
can actually use this the download

00:13:57,090 --> 00:14:01,380
Drupal core which I'm going to

00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,930
demonstrate it later and then I can also

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:07,350
download themes as well as modules using

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,960
this command and I can specify like you

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,990
can see this example here like this diff

00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:14,310
example oops you can specify a version

00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:18,930
number so if I don't want the most

00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:22,440
recent version of of the diff module for

00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,580
example I could put in the at the end of

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,140
it I could put in the version number and

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,780
it's going to pull that that exact one

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,950
from drupal org so that's a handy thing

00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:35,190
to know as well too and then at the

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:38,010
bottom it's going to have an alias to so

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:40,080
a lot of these have shortcuts as well

00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:42,750
which I don't like to the type so I

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:46,140
always look for those aliases for the

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:49,260
different commands all right so let me

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:50,940
just clear that so I abled that the flag

00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,830
module now let's say I wanted to disable

00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:57,000
that module that's going to be the

00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:58,950
disabled or D is command so a same thing

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,730
if I wanted to get information on that I

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:06,780
could just do drush help d is this one

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:11,190
the documentation is much shorter on so

00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:12,290
let me just disable go ahead and disable

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:15,350
it

00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:18,350
it's going to prompt me and I must say

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:20,589
okay if you don't want to be prompted

00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:23,329
every time just like in other ports and

00:15:20,589 --> 00:15:27,199
in the command line in general if I

00:15:23,329 --> 00:15:31,579
wanted to if I did the dash wife leg and

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,600
I said let's enable the flag module then

00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:34,240
it's not going to prop me it's just

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,100
going to automatically put hit yes and

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,630
and do that for me not prompt me for

00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:43,910
that so that for me that's a that's you

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:45,259
know a huge time saver right there just

00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:47,420
especially when I'm testing out new

00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:48,920
modules I want to bring up a dev site i

00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:52,670
wish i'm going to show you how to

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,139
install a site as well yeah it's really

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,370
really handy and another thing you can

00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:59,209
do to you so if i want to download a

00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:02,149
bunch of modules if I dude rush dl and

00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:07,220
ID let's say it's due flag I'll do

00:16:02,149 --> 00:16:09,380
module filter or some views features so

00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,019
I can just keep putting a space after

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:14,360
each module and hopefully i spelled all

00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:17,329
those right oh yeah of course this is

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,819
going to take a while on this Wi-Fi so

00:16:17,329 --> 00:16:22,100
you can have a long list of modules to

00:16:19,819 --> 00:16:24,740
if you want to do multiple ones I want

00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:26,180
to pull them down in and in download

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,649
them so that's really handy to know as

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,649
well with this

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:43,420
I'm sorry oh good good question actually

00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:45,940
okay so this one yep it just prompted me

00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:49,590
saying so I already have that flag

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:51,700
module which I did first another thing

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,080
drush is really good with is the like

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,390
prompting you for things and warning you

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:59,020
about things so I could say no here

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:00,820
which I will in this case so that killed

00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,900
everything basically but if I didn't do

00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:05,890
that and I did views and I did features

00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,360
and I hit download I'm not going to do

00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:09,790
it because it's going to be really slow

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:17,140
again but i forgot the download or the

00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:19,570
deal oops but not crush it's getting

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,829
late in the day alright so if i did that

00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,750
and i hit enter then it would do

00:17:20,829 --> 00:17:24,490
features and then download vuze because

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,270
as long as I haven't downloaded those

00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:27,270
already yep

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,010
that's a good question I can actually

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:50,630
test it actually don't know if the top

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:53,570
of my head i'll just do the flag this

00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,590
time we'll see what happens because yeah

00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,590
I guess I know we might never use it

00:17:54,590 --> 00:18:14,720
with the download when I normally use it

00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:22,159
more than able or disabled yeah okay

00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:25,039
yeah you're right if oh if I download

00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:26,809
two different ones I don't even know if

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,330
it'll let you do that to be honest I

00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:30,890
think I think yeah because it's still

00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,059
going to be the same machine name so

00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:35,419
it's going to think over right with

00:18:32,059 --> 00:18:36,770
whatever is in that folder so so yep you

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:42,140
were right so that dash Y flight would

00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:44,299
would do that now if you wanted so this

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:47,299
is just I have a clean install I want it

00:18:44,299 --> 00:18:48,770
down load modules enable/disable now if

00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:51,169
i'm logging on to a site and i just want

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:53,779
to see what's installed for example i

00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:57,590
want to see the module list there's a

00:18:53,779 --> 00:19:00,590
really handy command so I dude rush and

00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:03,380
it's pml which I believe stands for

00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,909
project management list a look at the

00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:08,690
documentation to be sure but this is

00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:10,190
going to spit out all the the modules

00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,610
that i have installed on the site so

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,260
it's just like going to your sites all

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:21,490
sites all modules folder or or going

00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,490
through it through the GUI so let me do

00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:31,730
oops yes I guess it just says I think it

00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,500
stands for project management list but

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,840
it has some different options here as

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,660
well too so one that I use a lot is this

00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,070
dash dash no core so if I if I just want

00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:42,080
to I don't want to see the core modules

00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:44,300
i just want to see the contribs that are

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:49,000
installed on the site if i do that same

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:53,510
command again and i just do no dash core

00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,100
all right so flag flag actions and

00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,020
backup and migrate only of those three

00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,760
modules on here so that's a really handy

00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:00,110
thing to know and and another thing too

00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,540
that's really nice so if I if I have a

00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:05,210
site with you know fifty hundred hover

00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:09,680
many modules on it if i do that drush

00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:11,270
pml you can add just like in other parts

00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:14,510
of the command line you can do or other

00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:16,100
shells I use that pipe character so

00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,170
those of you that aren't familiar with

00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:23,450
it it just between guess your back space

00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:27,650
in your Enter or the / shift / and if

00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:29,930
you do the grep command I do flag for

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,450
existed real quickly check is flag

00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,220
installed on this I can do grep that

00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:36,980
pipe will basically search that initial

00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,610
output and just filter / flag so that's

00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:42,380
some is that a lot it's really handy if

00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,480
I'm moving between multiple sites or

00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,310
have some tests or development sites i'm

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,640
working on you know don't remember if

00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:54,770
you know what module i have on there

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:57,080
yeah it's really handy thing to do and

00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:58,610
you can also use that too with the when

00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,120
i first logged on i just hit brush and

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,710
all those commands you know we're listed

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,990
there may I can do the same exact thing

00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:10,180
so I can do if I'm looking for a

00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,180
particular command like the pml commands

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,750
it that's going to show that is well to

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,450
just brush and then do the pipe

00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,600
character in the grep PMO so it tells me

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:26,290
what that that particular thing does or

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,760
in this case if I do p.m. all right oh

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,740
yes a project manager so these are all

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:34,220
the different commands that you can see

00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:39,580
that are related to two modules so

00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,580
enable/disable info list etc

00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,950
so so that's that's one of the most

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:51,050
helpful things especially for new people

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:54,590
just started out in Drupal is just being

00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:56,960
able to quickly modules modules also

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:00,710
what you can do is you can easily update

00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:06,040
modules so if I'm if I'm on a site if i

00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:09,650
go to my let me go to my local host here

00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:14,170
and i have a couple scenarios here so I

00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:17,930
i just created a site called old modules

00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:20,290
let's see if it loads let me run the

00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,370
dress command first while we're waiting

00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,970
another reason I like dress you don't

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:29,270
have to wait for the the browser to load

00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:37,310
so let me go to old modules oops i can

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:41,000
type oh I got to go that's why all right

00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:45,950
awesome if i go to dude rush help and I

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,570
do p.m. update what p.m. update is I

00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:51,230
guess this one has a shortcut up I

00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:53,900
didn't realize that that's nice this is

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,970
going to go and look for any any of my

00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,620
modules that that either have like a

00:22:55,970 --> 00:23:00,440
security release or just the new version

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,210
could be a new enhancement or or

00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,210
something that was fixed a bug that was

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:07,490
fixed and basically what this is is like

00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:11,870
if you're if you're on your site and you

00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:13,640
go to reports and I guess availab

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,050
available updates and you know a lot of

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,760
times when you have a module it needs

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,490
update and get that big red thing at the

00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:21,160
top of your page that is you know it's

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:23,480
always at the top of your modules page

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:30,770
so that's what this is going to do if I

00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:34,120
do through drush okay so i think i get

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,380
around kranti but let me just do drush

00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,310
i'll do p.m. update i guess i won't use

00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,750
the alias so it's going to make they go

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,390
out to drupal.org it's going to check

00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:47,710
all the modules that on you have on your

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:47,710
site go see if there's a new version

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:55,210
eventually it's going to tell me

00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:55,210
if there's something new or not

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,030
alright so there we go so you can see

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:05,590
flag comes back and views come back they

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:08,140
both come back so they they say update

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:12,070
available that's still loading as well

00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:15,310
but um so chaos tools is up to date if I

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:18,900
scroll back up it checks it also checks

00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:22,030
Drupal core as well so you can see

00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,820
Drupal core send out one for that is up

00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:28,630
to date and then KS tools which is a

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:30,970
module is up to date as well but it's

00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:32,920
going to prompt me here that if I want

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:34,840
to update the flag and the views module

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,450
so this is really handy especially if

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,760
you have a lot of modules or multiple

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,620
sites I can go in here I can just it's

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,530
going to automatically back this up for

00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:46,000
me to you'll notice it prompts you here

00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:48,070
it's going to back up the old version of

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,650
that module or theme or whatever you're

00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:54,580
updating I should hit yes because it's

00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:57,160
going to take a little while so it's

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,860
going to go ahead and do that in it in

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:03,580
this again it was just a huge time-saver

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,410
for me and the more sites you have the

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,720
more obviously the more of a time-saving

00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,160
it's going to be for you all right and

00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,890
so there that one completed the flag

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:14,640
module completed and then it does give

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:19,090
you the path where it backed it up to

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,440
the previous version and then views I've

00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:24,130
used as kind of a big module that wasn't

00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:27,160
a good one to do maybe cancel out if it

00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:28,210
doesn't come up soon but you can

00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,860
definitely see where this is going to be

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:35,260
helpful even on a small site but

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:37,840
certainly the more more modules the the

00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,030
better all right yeah I'll just cancel

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,730
out of it all right but it would have

00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:46,750
updated views but views is just a kind

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:48,900
of a big module so I showed you guys how

00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:52,180
to download a module and able a module

00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,340
disable module so now let's actually go

00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,680
ahead and bring a new site up this is

00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,970
probably the next thing for me for it

00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:00,670
from a development standpoint it's just

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:03,000
it's so easy to create a clean drupal

00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:03,000
ins Oh

00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:20,450
that I'm actually not sure does anyone

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:23,059
know yeah yeah that I'm not sure about I

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:27,590
I believe it still does but yeah it may

00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:34,010
just have affected somehow yeah yeah I'm

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:39,889
not sure yeah no problem oh so if I

00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:42,230
wanted to download Drupal let's going to

00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:46,130
get back to my my web root here just do

00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:48,919
an LS well I can use that dl command

00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,679
again so I could do drush dl if I just

00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,269
do drupal that's going to just go out

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,830
and grab 7 dot 14 which is the current

00:26:53,269 --> 00:26:59,470
version of Drupal just and put it in

00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:06,440
this directory but if I actually go to

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:09,740
the help menu there's an option which i

00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,380
think is near the top ously a Drupal

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:13,370
project rename so if I just download

00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,919
it's going to download it's just going

00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:17,149
to call it drupal 7 14 that's just going

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,519
to be the file at sin but if I want to

00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:22,130
download it and rename it in one step I

00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:28,399
can use this command so I like to use

00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:31,309
this one a lot my download Drupal just

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:38,120
so i know what i'm using it for so let's

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:41,659
do that oops pieced it i'm just going to

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:43,880
call it Fred that way you'll know what

00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:45,740
it is so it's going to go out there and

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,440
do that so when it downloads this and

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,700
I'm still going to have to open up the

00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,519
browser I'm going to have to do the

00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:55,639
install that PHP file if I just did this

00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:57,200
but i'm lazy and I I don't like to go

00:27:55,639 --> 00:27:58,190
through the web browser and do that so

00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,360
i'm going to show you guys once this

00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:01,100
finishes i'm going to show you another

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,840
step that you can do it's going to

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:07,340
automatically go out and create your

00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:11,720
database as well and make a copy of your

00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:15,500
settings at PHP file and change the

00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:18,340
permissions on that so this and we let

00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,340
this keep going I guess

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:32,290
um so I so it's just basically adding

00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:34,980
another folder so if i go to let me just

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:38,860
go through my browser because that's

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,600
slow so I go to localhost it's basically

00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,820
just going to create another actually

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,730
there it is spread so I that's how I

00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:47,380
just have it set up right here so it it

00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:51,330
just downloads the whole Drupal folder

00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,330
and then renames the the Drupal folder

00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,309
okay so then all right so i just

00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:02,290
downloaded what weird by switch screens

00:28:56,309 --> 00:29:04,179
and then what i can do next i'm going to

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,340
use this the site install is what's

00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:10,330
called so if i go to help Josh help

00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:12,250
again SI is short for site install this

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:13,450
is what's actually will go and create so

00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,580
you would solve the create your database

00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:17,559
you select the copy or settings PHP file

00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:19,540
change the permissions but this is

00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:23,950
actually going to go do that in one in

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:33,940
one swoop so there's an I think there's

00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:37,390
an example in here let's yet so it's the

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,880
stress site install right here and I'm

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:42,070
actually i'm going to copy and um i

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:45,070
actually have it I cheated so I knew

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,900
this was going to take a while so I just

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,809
copy and paste it in here but i'll

00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:57,460
explain what it is when I am get back to

00:29:49,809 --> 00:29:59,860
the command prompt oops I have to go so

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:02,350
this is giving again it's good at giving

00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,570
you feedback so I'm not in a Drupal root

00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:08,830
directory so I got to go to Fred which i

00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:16,179
hopes so let me try that again I'll just

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:17,350
clear it to you there we go alright so

00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:18,940
it's going to warn me just saying it's

00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:20,650
going to create a new database in a

00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,200
settings PHP file but I'm going to say

00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:28,720
that's okay so so basically what this

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:32,380
command is doing so it's here it's just

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,600
going to localhost basically so I'm

00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:38,809
doing dress SI foresight install again

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:41,559
putting this option here for DB you are

00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:44,179
and I'm just running on localhost here

00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,519
and then a root is just what I have for

00:30:44,179 --> 00:30:50,539
my my password on my local machine and

00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:51,590
I'm a Chicago Bears fan so this is and I

00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:54,620
don't use this password for anything

00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:56,720
else so just on my local machine here

00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,210
but that's the password for the database

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:03,700
and then localhost / Fred so where I

00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:05,899
wanted that installed and then what this

00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,490
what this will do to is it just creates

00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:09,499
a default actually I think and rush for

00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:11,029
used to just do admin admin so username

00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:12,799
admin password admin but I think and

00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:15,740
rush fried they just changed this so now

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:20,059
there's a password that's going to give

00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:25,190
me so I can actually take that and I

00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:27,919
copy that password and let me open up my

00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,450
browser and I'll go to this Fred site

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,610
just to show you guys that I have a new

00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:38,950
site here let's go to admin and let's

00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:38,950
piece that password in and

00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:47,180
what's it oh yeah um yeah I think you

00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:48,950
can actually yeah yeah you definitely

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,890
can yeah there's some user commands I'm

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,570
actually i'll i'll show you that too i

00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:56,510
canna to do it through the GUI but yeah

00:31:53,570 --> 00:32:06,800
you could do it through drush as well so

00:31:56,510 --> 00:32:08,510
if i did oops I think it's oh yeah so

00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,510
there's user dash password I guess is

00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:14,180
the one or you you pewds so I could do

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:18,560
it that way too if I didn't want to copy

00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:21,500
and paste it so yeah so I have a clean

00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,600
drupal site installed and and again that

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,120
would be even faster if he a little bit

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,280
faster internet but it's if you it's

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,130
really easy yet the install sites that

00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:34,400
way just a clean drupal site that you

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:38,780
want to use there's also a new feature

00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:41,510
and josh 5 i'm trying to think I know

00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:44,420
mark shropshire demonstrated and his

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:51,110
presentation let me see if I can find it

00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:52,970
quick I think it's the earth not

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:55,880
something make generate I can't remember

00:32:52,970 --> 00:33:00,550
now if there's a do you noted remember

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:00,550
it okay okay go ahead

00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,630
yeah they that be the case yeah but so

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:27,190
what it will do like any controls it

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,140
would if you use that make file it

00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,150
automatically go out and grab you know

00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,770
the latest version of those or if you

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:35,290
specified a version it would grab those

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:44,290
from drupal org but but yeah but the

00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:45,670
custom ones if you i think i think you

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,740
could if you had them on up like on

00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:48,790
github or something i think you can you

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,440
could do it that way like you could

00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:55,350
reference yeah I haven't I haven't used

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,310
make files a lot but I'm pretty sure

00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,440
someone else was demonstrating it I

00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:01,330
think they were actually taking like

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,650
their address from gettin and grabbing

00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:09,700
the latest version from their git

00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:11,409
repository so all right anyway so that

00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,030
that would be how you install a site i

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:17,159
can't remember what that the new thing

00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:20,800
was in drush five i can look it up later

00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,870
all right so I guess any questions on

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,780
that site install part are you guys

00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:30,060
totally fried right now alright cool

00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,950
alright so that that's a really handy

00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:36,690
thing as well so the modules down the

00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:41,740
modules in quickly installing Drupal

00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:44,409
another thing you can do to if I want it

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:47,379
so you notice like that site name it

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:49,870
just says site install so another

00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:53,639
command that I could do if I want to

00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:57,910
just quickly change that through josh

00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:01,330
its drush and i believe it's not cite

00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:03,490
underscore name I could check the help

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:07,780
but I think this is right so I'll do

00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:11,160
Fred no

00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,160
I think I might have written it down

00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:26,610
oh I know we're just so that's V i

00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:28,410
forgot visa I think yeah there we go so

00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:30,780
you had V set for variable set that's

00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:33,630
what I forgot it's why did help be set

00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:36,600
then I think it would come up alright so

00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:39,570
I'm just approved you that worked so

00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,130
just changed it to Fred and that's

00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:42,780
basically going into the variables table

00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,580
and your database for Drupal there I

00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:46,050
don't use that a whole lot but there's a

00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,270
whole bunch of other variables that you

00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:51,330
can change using that V set command is

00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:54,990
well too and again you can get it

00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:58,440
through here or if you don't like to

00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:00,420
look at all these options through the

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,350
command line go to that site that i

00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:07,230
mentioned before the dress org which i

00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,650
think you can get it all that

00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:12,570
information here as well too so if you

00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:16,170
you wanted to see the the variable set

00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:17,340
here too you can get it that way as well

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:25,080
if you don't want to look at it through

00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:28,109
the through the command line oh sure yes

00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:32,250
I did actually and go back to the

00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:33,810
command it did so I did yeah so it's

00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:36,119
site underscore name that's the variable

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:39,240
in the variables table and database and

00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:45,710
then just the quotes around whatever you

00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:45,710
want for the for the title all right

00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:55,190
like right now if I'd if I change it no

00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,190
I can change it to whatever I want

00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:03,960
what's it yeah this is just the title of

00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:05,520
you like the main title of your your

00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:08,010
site like that's always going to be on a

00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,720
the top of its like that you had the

00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:11,460
variable that's always at the top header

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:20,790
of depending on what theme you use I

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:22,470
guess but it's actually well I can

00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,850
through the database that's what or

00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,370
through sequel but I'm trying to think I

00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:30,090
don't believe you can go and edit a note

00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:35,910
as far as I know yeah directly through

00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:40,290
there I know I wouldn't recommend doing

00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:41,790
that yeah so I went that's the but yeah

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:44,190
I don't think there's any as far as I

00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:48,810
know there's no way that yeah like open

00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:51,080
open it up in fear of her VI or or some

00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,080
editor

00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:59,450
yep yeah there's yeah or is that what

00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:02,630
you were referring to you like the okay

00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,280
because yeah there is a develop which

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,140
like again with the test site if you

00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,810
want to just get a bunch of content that

00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:13,250
has drush integration so I can actually

00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:16,190
say generate 100 nodes and make them 50

00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:18,650
stories and 50 articles or whatever

00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,930
content type i want so that that's one

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:23,180
thing but in terms of like just typing

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:31,040
out a no as far as i know i don't think

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:32,660
that's that's possible so how many

00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,490
people went to the features presentation

00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:39,800
today v view okay so another really good

00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:40,970
thing about drush in if you use features

00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,550
you I really would highly recommend

00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:48,080
using dress for that as well too I think

00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:52,580
I have a site here yeah so it's the

00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:54,410
features one so if I dude rush FL which

00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:57,050
is features list this is going to go and

00:38:54,410 --> 00:39:03,800
find all those features on my site it's

00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:05,510
really handy too because it'll say it'll

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,390
say the state of them here so I guess

00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:11,720
all these ones that I have right now are

00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:13,070
there none of them are overridden but if

00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,930
it was overridden like somebody had made

00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,140
a change to one of the features and I

00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:22,510
quickly wanted to revert it back there's

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:26,900
if i go to dress again and I do grip

00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:31,250
think it's FR yeah so its features

00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:33,980
revert so features revert that that's

00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,200
really a handy feature handy command as

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,610
well or revert all too so if i want to

00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:40,040
refer to all features back to previous

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,450
state i made some changes i don't like

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:44,540
them I want to bring it back into the

00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:48,140
code the state that the codes in that's

00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:51,250
an option as well also be mentioned

00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:57,680
backing up before so i think i have a

00:39:51,250 --> 00:40:01,150
say with oops one too far and i keep

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,150
doing that today let's see

00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,450
believe it's my drupal 7 site i think i

00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:07,700
have the backup in my drip migrate

00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:12,050
module on here so i'm going to do the

00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:16,850
pml again i'll just do grep held you

00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:25,070
back up okay yep so i do you have it so

00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:29,450
if i do i believe it's BB yes let's BB

00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:31,520
is the alias so if i do drush BB if i

00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,840
have backup in my grade setup what this

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,400
is going to do it's automatically if I

00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,340
as long as i have it set up i have a

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,540
default folder for my database to go

00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,090
into through this it's going to

00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,820
automatically go ahead and do yeah there

00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:45,800
we go so it's going to put that in my

00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:47,540
manual backups directory whatever i

00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:49,520
specified in the back up in my great

00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,840
module so this is something I use all

00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:53,360
the time too like if I'm going to make a

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:56,390
change on the dev site for example or a

00:40:53,360 --> 00:41:01,010
test side it can really quickly just get

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:04,520
a backup of the database just typing

00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:07,850
drush be beat so really really handy to

00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:09,320
use that as well I mentioned that you

00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:12,109
another thing too that's nice about this

00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:13,700
is you can do sequel through this as

00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:15,470
well so if i wanted to connect to the

00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:17,740
database and just run a quick sequel

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:17,740
query

00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:31,809
oh yeah so actually if I dude rush can I

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,809
camera try and remember what it is I

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:43,190
thought I could maybe think they're all

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:47,510
in there BAM oops oh yes a restore so

00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:49,430
band I just BAM dash restore yep yeah so

00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:51,200
if you do the dress pipe crap BAM

00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:54,829
that'll show you all the commands that

00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,390
you can do and if the first time you if

00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:57,349
you just install back up a migrate and

00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:59,450
try and run it you'll get an error

00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:01,640
because you have to set up the directory

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:05,329
that you want your database backups to

00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,420
go into but getting back to the the

00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:13,279
sequel if I want to just run a quick

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:14,839
sequel query for example here's the the

00:42:13,279 --> 00:42:17,450
different sequel commands that you have

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,299
so it through the command line let's say

00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,720
for example I just wanted to look up

00:42:19,299 --> 00:42:29,569
some information on a particular user ID

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:37,339
so if I go brush and SS q lq and then I

00:42:29,569 --> 00:42:40,359
put my query end so let's if you don't

00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:47,329
know sequel don't it's alright i'll just

00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:49,569
select oh i forgot my alright thanks try

00:42:47,329 --> 00:42:49,569
that again

00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:57,090
there we go okay so it's kind of a mess

00:42:53,670 --> 00:43:01,400
but they did return information about

00:42:57,090 --> 00:43:01,400
user ID number one or if I wanted to do

00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:12,739
what's I'm sorry

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:38,019
oh okay okay got you okay yep that oh ok

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:40,480
I always do that ah ok thank you thank

00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:43,029
you yeah yeah one of the reasons I

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,910
wanted to do this session to I I'm not

00:43:43,029 --> 00:43:48,460
really the most techie person so I I

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:49,839
yeah so I didn't used rush for a long

00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:55,299
time and I wish I would have started

00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:57,940
using it sooner cuz yeah so it's yeah

00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,739
it's really handy but yeah this is

00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,289
another way you can access you know

00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:03,660
sequel you know obviously we're doing a

00:44:02,289 --> 00:44:06,039
lot of queries you probably want to use

00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,400
works equal work bench or something else

00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:11,349
but um but it's handy if I just wanted

00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,450
to look up some information real quickly

00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:16,299
all right so we're getting close on time

00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:18,549
let me just see I had think one or two

00:44:16,299 --> 00:44:25,299
other things i want to show you but i'll

00:44:18,549 --> 00:44:27,789
keep it short oh so updating drupal it's

00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:31,720
kind of a big one it's pretty much the

00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:34,869
same as why did the update in the

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:38,049
modules so let me just switch to another

00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:41,380
site this old drupal that i set up i

00:44:38,049 --> 00:44:44,819
think it's on if i do address status

00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:48,309
again you can see it's on yeah 7 dot 13

00:44:44,819 --> 00:44:49,989
so this is the one I want but if if I

00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:54,819
wanted to verify if it was up to date I

00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:56,619
would do you again p.m. update I might

00:44:54,819 --> 00:44:59,499
be a little slow here but if I don't

00:44:56,619 --> 00:45:01,869
know if you guys have ever done the core

00:44:59,499 --> 00:45:05,769
upgrade manually it can be kind of a

00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:07,599
pain yeah okay yeah so when I the first

00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:10,660
time I did this on Josh I was like oh my

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:14,319
god like oh my god I can't put yeah

00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:16,269
exactly yeah so you definitely want to

00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,579
back to back up everything before you do

00:45:16,269 --> 00:45:20,200
this especially the firt like before you

00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:22,239
really trust rush and you where you

00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:25,450
trust you trust yourself that you're

00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,320
typing Harry commands and stuff but oh

00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,210
man it saves you so much time

00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,230
so yes it's going to come back it's

00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,500
going to tell me that there's an update

00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:35,150
available and then it's going to give me

00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:38,930
a warning here like if I made changes to

00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:40,670
my htaccess file back that up yeah you

00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:43,190
definitely do a ftp back up and back up

00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:45,140
everything and database backup all that

00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,120
it does I think it does back it up for

00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:49,340
you automatically to but I'd still would

00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:53,450
you know just do it to be safe I'm kind

00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:56,150
of paranoid like that so let me do this

00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:59,000
update and then another nice thing about

00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,200
this too is a lot of times too or when

00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,810
you update modules you have to update

00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:06,800
the database as well to you have to do

00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:09,980
the update let's look on so you have to

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,340
do the update PHP script I can actually

00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,280
do that right through drush so here we

00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:18,350
go just updated as well where normally

00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:21,140
you have to be logged in as the root or

00:46:18,350 --> 00:46:23,120
uid one on Drupal but I can actually do

00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,370
that through drush so that for me to

00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,620
that's a really nice feature about using

00:46:25,370 --> 00:46:29,720
dress so that this is going to spit out

00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:33,950
or it did spit out basically all the

00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:39,110
information about what it updated it

00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:40,610
just did those updates it's going to

00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:45,530
tell me where the backup was saved as

00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:47,750
well I'm up to 7 dot 14 if i do the

00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:49,610
dress update it's actually update DB i

00:46:47,750 --> 00:46:52,520
don't think it's yes it doesn't have any

00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:54,860
updates required but i already went

00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:56,000
through and did that but that's you can

00:46:54,860 --> 00:47:00,620
actually do that right through drush as

00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:03,620
well so that yeah so one reason used

00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:06,440
rush one really major reason is updating

00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:08,560
Drupal core it it makes life so much

00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,560
easier

00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:22,950
update oh yeah it's the same thing is

00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:25,950
running on there's a file its update

00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,900
that PHP oh you know yep that's what

00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:33,089
dress yeah update DB that's what that

00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:35,010
yep yeah it runs that so so yeah we're

00:47:33,089 --> 00:47:43,190
almost out of time so I think that's all

00:47:35,010 --> 00:47:48,420
that I had you got a question I guy I

00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:49,859
actually have not I oh yeah thank you so

00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:54,089
the question was if I've ever used the

00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:55,890
dress site upgrade command which goes

00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:58,410
from if you're going through like a

00:47:55,890 --> 00:48:03,290
major core upgrade so a version like six

00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:03,290
to seven or five to six that I have not

00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:11,670
yeah yeah I didn't even get into the

00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:14,250
aliases at all to is it oh ok yeah that

00:48:11,670 --> 00:48:16,710
I don't have experience with um I'm

00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,260
going to have to update a Drupal 6 site

00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:20,940
soon so that's probably something to

00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:22,589
learn well but now coming months but

00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,910
yeah right now I don't know what yeah

00:48:22,589 --> 00:48:25,290
and you can actually thanks for

00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,670
mentioning that because aliases to it

00:48:25,290 --> 00:48:29,369
actually my demo site I don't have any

00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:31,200
of those but I keep switching between

00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:34,260
different Drupal roots but if I'm using

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,900
an alias if I have like a dev site i can

00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:39,599
just do if i call it dev I can just do

00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:42,119
drush at dev status or whatever command

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,220
I want to run and then drush at live or

00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:46,020
and call it whatever I want but it's it

00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,030
doesn't matter what directory I man so

00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:52,589
that's you know something down the road

00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:55,079
that I would recommend to I there's a

00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:59,000
file that you do it and I don't think i

00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,000
have it it's probably i bet it's on the

00:49:08,430 --> 00:49:13,240
yeah there's they have actually the

00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,530
documentation if you download when you

00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,900
download rush they have a bunch of

00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:18,610
examples too and they have some example

00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,920
aliases so I basically just followed

00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:23,680
those verbatim and yeah it was really

00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,120
pretty easy and you can write your own

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,570
drush commands to like if you have a

00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:30,550
module and they have an example I think

00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:40,900
it's like I think it's like called make

00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:44,230
me a sandwich or something it they ok

00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,790
yeah so yeah it's like you tell josh he

00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,710
tell it to make you sandwich i think it

00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:48,940
only makes you a sandwich if you're

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,880
logged in as root or something like that

00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:54,820
but that's the example use but yeah it

00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,030
really has good documentation if you

00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:00,250
look at any any module you download has

00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:03,370
rushed inc at the end of it to that

00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:07,380
means that it has drush commands with

00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:07,380
that module as well yep

00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:34,000
that's a good question i'm i'm guessing

00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:36,130
through a media yeah i'm not actually

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,020
under percent sure on that yeah i mean

00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:41,020
you definitely obviously have to have

00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:42,580
you know ssh access to your server how

00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:44,350
to be able to do it a lot of like shared

00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:46,300
hosts you have you don't get that so

00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,650
let's I know like hot Drupal that's all

00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,860
here they even their base plan you can

00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:53,170
do that but yeah as far as i know i

00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:59,200
think you need it it would have to be

00:50:53,170 --> 00:51:00,880
installed yeah well i think it's a

00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,410
hugely additional fee to get the ssh

00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:06,940
access i actually I don't oh yeah no

00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:14,680
they should they should allow it then I

00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:18,970
haven't used godaddy and okay really

00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:20,560
okay okay i guess i haven't used I we

00:51:18,970 --> 00:51:24,100
run most of our sites internally so we

00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:25,570
have access to most everything but I

00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:27,670
know that's one complaint that people

00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:33,250
have with shared houses yeah they can't

00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:35,790
use drush always any other questions you

00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:35,790
guys still awake

00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,700
yeah yeah yeah well I i started doing a

00:51:43,590 --> 00:51:46,800
bunch of slides and I'm like you know

00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:48,870
what it's like took half of them out

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,670
because I'm like it's it's hard to death

00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:53,940
like to talk about you have to really

00:51:50,670 --> 00:52:01,200
see it in action so all right cool Oh

00:51:53,940 --> 00:52:05,430
question just to make to make sure that

00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:07,470
it is oh I know either just you can just

00:52:05,430 --> 00:52:10,890
dude rush so the question was how do you

00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:13,530
check if it just roll isn't installed so

00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:15,840
what you can do is you came to this tape

00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:18,060
drush if you get all these commands you

00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,120
know its installed if it's not installed

00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:25,200
it's going to say unknown command rush

00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:27,690
but I also do i do dress status I think

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,450
there's even a command to do want to say

00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:35,090
which drush oh yeah I guess that just

00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:35,090
shows that's where mice yeah

00:52:38,090 --> 00:52:44,420
yeah I'm sorry could you repeat the

00:52:42,390 --> 00:52:44,420
question

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:56,970
oh and then make it executable oh so it

00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:59,920
basically are you are you familiar with

00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:05,430
yeah like with the command line how to

00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:09,640
add yeah like you or UX for example like

00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:13,359
dramatics the dress file and actually

00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:15,520
that video that i mentioned to she she

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:19,170
actually does it to like she shows you

00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,170
the exact command that you need the type

00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:30,130
yeah good yeah that's a good point yet

00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:34,599
didn't mention that as well yeah

00:53:30,130 --> 00:53:38,500
definitely definitely all right anyone

00:53:34,599 --> 00:53:40,680
else all right well I'm done you guys

00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,680
are

00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,720
you

00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,989
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:29,940
ago we could not have imagined that

00:54:27,989 --> 00:54:32,160
asterisk would not only become the most

00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,289
widely adopted open source communication

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,329
software on the planet but that it would

00:54:34,289 --> 00:54:38,849
impact the entire industry in the way

00:54:36,329 --> 00:54:40,829
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:54:38,849 --> 00:54:43,469
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:45,420
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:47,489
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:48,930
transition of power from the hands of

00:54:47,489 --> 00:54:51,180
the traditional proprietary phone

00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:53,579
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:55,529
administrators of phone systems using

00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:56,759
this power our customers have created

00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:58,709
all sorts of business changing

00:54:56,759 --> 00:55:00,539
applications from small office phone

00:54:58,709 --> 00:55:03,059
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:04,680
the international carrier networks in

00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:06,450
fact there's even an entire country

00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,849
those communications infrastructure runs

00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:10,979
on esters the gym has always been about

00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:12,690
creating technology that expands

00:55:10,979 --> 00:55:14,849
communications capabilities in ways that

00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:16,049
we could never have imagined and that's

00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:18,809
part of what's game-changing about

00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:21,150
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:55:18,809 --> 00:55:23,249
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:25,349
IP phones that extends control of the

00:55:23,249 --> 00:55:27,119
user all the way to the desktop the

00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,829
launch of these new products represents

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,779
the next phase indigenous history of

00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:33,329
innovation these are the first and only

00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:35,039
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:36,569
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,609
our expectations for building a family

00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:40,769
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:55:38,609 --> 00:55:42,509
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:44,130
the team to build the phones such that

00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:46,349
they were easy to install integrate

00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:48,180
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:50,759
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,559
that goal user feedback is validating

00:55:50,759 --> 00:55:54,509
that when it comes to operation with a

00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,910
through space systems including our own

00:55:54,509 --> 00:55:59,489
Switchvox based product these are the

00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:00,809
easiest to use best integrated most

00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:03,390
interoperable products on the market

00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:05,390
today the digitally phones will

00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:07,440
initially include three IP des hommes

00:56:05,390 --> 00:56:09,390
uniquely designed to complement any

00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,249
asterisks or Switchvox based solution

00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:13,920
these phones are different for a number

00:56:11,249 --> 00:56:16,559
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,999
designed for use with esters secondly

00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:19,440
we've made it really easy to

00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:22,019
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,699
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:56:22,019 --> 00:56:25,410
to access information inside of

00:56:23,699 --> 00:56:26,740
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:56:25,410 --> 00:56:29,410
between an application

00:56:26,740 --> 00:56:31,240
and the phone additionally we've created

00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:33,580
an application's engine that allows

00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,490
users and developers to create and run

00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:38,560
their own apps on the phone and finally

00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:40,600
we've done all of this at a very

00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:42,310
compelling price point at Digium we're

00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:44,080
always thinking of ways to give our

00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:46,450
customers the best value in business

00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,310
phone systems and also give them the

00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,500
power to create their own solutions or

00:56:48,310 --> 00:56:52,390
any communications challenge well

00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,040
continue to push the boundaries not only

00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,080
to make Astra's cooler faster and more

00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:57,730
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:56:56,080 --> 00:57:00,190
asterisk employed communications even

00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:03,900
easier and together we'll change the way

00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:03,900
the world communicates again

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:11,100
you

00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:21,140
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:23,300
way to better utilize all your resources

00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:26,750
and it makes managing all your resources

00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:30,580
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:34,070
happening in open source the

00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:35,900
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,820
of the community and the speed at which

00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:40,010
these are these you know these

00:57:37,820 --> 00:57:42,320
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:44,930
discovered and then fixed is it like

00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,630
that really shows the power of the you

00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:49,250
know of the open source community it is

00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:53,450
global and it's definitely because of

00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:59,780
the users community people are extremely

00:57:53,450 --> 00:58:01,520
friendly and almost ready to help if you

00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:02,980
go an entire see any day you'll see

00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,120
these guys helping each other out and

00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:08,000
they're all doing it like in a selfless

00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:09,830
manner the product is transparent for

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,850
everyone everyone can look at the code

00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:16,070
base everyone can see how close that is

00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:21,920
being built nothing nothing is

00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:24,560
proprietary everything is open in many

00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:28,760
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:32,540
unborn health CloudStack the most

00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:36,420
exciting event in recent memory for me

00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:39,090
was our first developer boot camp

00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:41,730
and our call gave people I gave me two

00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:45,690
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:49,860
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:52,710
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:55,230
chairs in the room twice everything

00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:58,560
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:58:55,230 --> 00:59:01,560
is open source and so I don't think that

00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,480
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:06,900
sources not pervasive in cloud computing

00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:09,090
and so i think it's i think it's an

00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,590
assumption i think when you talk about

00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:15,750
cloud computing you're really talking

00:59:10,590 --> 00:59:17,700
about a source cloud computing cloud sac

00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:20,460
is a robust solution for large

00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,860
deployments you'll have dozens of data

00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:26,820
centers and thousands of servers in each

00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:30,150
data center is these hardware is going

00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:33,360
to fail and CloudStack is designed to

00:59:30,150 --> 00:59:35,850
handle number one that mass scale number

00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,580
two it's designed to handle the failure

00:59:35,850 --> 00:59:41,100
that inevitably happens in large

00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:44,640
deployments started working on college

00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:48,000
attack over four years ago and it was

00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:50,670
the original set of people working on it

00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,780
had a background of delivering software

00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:59,010
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:59:54,780 --> 01:00:02,640
lots of users actually using it high

00:59:59,010 --> 01:00:05,700
availability is a key feature multiple

01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:07,740
hypervisors support different network

01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:10,410
models you can pick up whatever suits

01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:12,660
you better while step management server

01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:16,350
can be deployed in different physical

01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:18,030
machines it definitely has a huge

01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:22,980
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:00:18,030 --> 01:00:25,590
there's a major movie studio that they

01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:28,890
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:30,870
to transcode video and i thought that

01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:32,520
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:35,790
more fascinating is what they did during

01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:38,550
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:39,930
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,510
lunch was over they would destroy all

01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:42,630
the instance

01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:46,030
doesn't go back to doing real work

01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:47,560

01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:49,420
different aspects and there's no one

01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:52,410
person that's kind of like a master of

01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:55,900
all those realms I think cloudstack as a

01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:58,120
project is going to be one of the

01:00:55,900 --> 01:01:02,170
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:07,600
most feature fallen and and robust

01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:10,500
platforms out they were Adam senior

01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:10,500
