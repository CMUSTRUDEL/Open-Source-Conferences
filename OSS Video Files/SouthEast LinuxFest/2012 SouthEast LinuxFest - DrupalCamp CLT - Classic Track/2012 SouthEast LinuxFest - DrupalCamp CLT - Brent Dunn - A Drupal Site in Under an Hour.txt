the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040
the 2012 southeast linux fest in

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,410
charlotte north carolina it is licensed

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,859
more information about the southeast

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:19,230
linux fest visit www.lend expense org

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:27,330
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,150
possible I think in the end of july in

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,189
washington it's a very good camp i think

00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,940
it's a second year and Jeff and his

00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,530
keynote did an uber cart ecommerce site

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,040
in 30 minutes and I thought that was

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:43,140
really practical an example for to show

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,960
people that might come to a camp and

00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,879
don't get to experience what actually

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,829
site building looks like you might learn

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:51,539
about a module you might see conceptual

00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:53,640
slides and things but not actually get

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,670
to see it done so I borrowed that from

00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:00,030
Jeff and asked him and he said go for it

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:03,300
he also did his in d6 and we'll be doing

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,129
d7 today so the other prerequisites are

00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:08,250
to have a test environment a way that

00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:10,590
you can install local Drupal and set up

00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,560
an what's known as an amp environment I

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:17,220
guess damp might stand for Drupal mamp

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,439
for Mac wamp for windows or xampp or

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,939
some kind of cross-platform you need to

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,970
kind of know that and there's plenty of

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,799
help online to get you up and running we

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:28,350
won't be doing that part will assume you

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,229
have already done that and lastly the

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,350
ability to read I'm sure most people can

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:37,110
or work in on it hopefully it's

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,759
specifically the readme.txt file that

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:41,640
comes with Drupal when you install it

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,110
you'll need to take the time which we

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,630
won't have time today to cover those

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,640
things because they're written very

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,110
specifically for people that don't know

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,520
how to do something it's the instruction

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:53,280
manual unless you'd like to build things

00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,380
without reading and understanding it i

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,390
highly recommend it i still use them

00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,979
when i download a module I open the

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,990
readme and see what the developers have

00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:02,880
to say and usually it's up to date if

00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:06,680
it's not the module page where you've

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,200
downloaded a contributory ripple core or

00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,310
a theme it's going to have everything

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,310
you really need to know in the

00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:15,200
instruction manual so it's kind of

00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:18,290
advice you might not normally follow if

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,820
you're building ikea parts at home but

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,990
it's really helpful in the world of site

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,580
building i advertised all of these

00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:29,150
things that we would be able to pull off

00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,630
and and i did this as a survey of what

00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,370
what most beginners would like to learn

00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:36,470
and I talked to some guys in Florida

00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:38,690
that suggested these things so I tried

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,920
my best to pull them off the reality is

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,230
this is all we're going to have time to

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,970
get to today so if that's a bummer and

00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,890
you want to leave I'm sorry go ahead

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,950
feel I'm not ashamed if you have to

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,180
leave now so that's basically it it's

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,400
time to get started I'm going to talk

00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:56,780
fast I'm normally a slow talker because

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,510
I'm from the south and also hopefully

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:02,630
which is not a bummer we're going to do

00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:04,640
this in a pre-recorded format which is

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,010
already started and I'll try to do kind

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,020
of like VCR controls so I've recorded

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,209
this so we can do it we can playback and

00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:18,470
speed up ok I think we're back thank you

00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:19,670
that was fast work so to start off to

00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,070
build a Drupal site you're going to go

00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,209
we're going to visit drupal.org a couple

00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:29,200
times a day we're going to go to the

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:31,700
download & extend button and if you see

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,920
there's a couple places you can get to

00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,600
from this where's modules and themes and

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,250
core the big green button is what we're

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:41,989
going to start with today so I'm going

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:44,120
to go down here and I'm going to read

00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,310
through this along with you know the

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,900
readme file once I've done the download

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,549
I'm going to get the recommended release

00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:54,950
of Drupal which is the green bar pull

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:56,750
that down to my local folder that I've

00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,450
already sent set up in my map

00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:01,700
environment so that I have a web page

00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:03,290
that will pull up where this folder is

00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,840
sitting I've done that part in advance

00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:07,519
of this and when you've when you pull

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,140
down Drupal this is what it looks like

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
when you've unzipped it on your local

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,880
computer and you see here there's the

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,410
readme.txt file so this is Drupal this

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,359
is what it looks like out of the box how

00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:18,450
many just deposit or a second how many

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:21,870
have never done that much

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:23,340
a couple that's good so it's what this

00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,980
would be good how many have you done it

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,110
like over a hundred times alright

00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:33,120
alright so so might be boring for some

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:35,220
of you pulling it down to your to your

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,690
local computer and then pulling up the

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,670
web server that you've set up through

00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,040
map loading that up for the very first

00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:44,460
time will take you to the Installer by

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,810
default so you have install PHP ready to

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,450
go for you and then you're going to walk

00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:51,000
through the setup steps for Drupal and

00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,280
put the standard install so we get the

00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,800
most of the modules that come with core

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,170
that we want and we can just use English

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,530
for today's example you could add as

00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,870
many languages as you need for your site

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,270
the second step to actually setting up

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,090
Drupal is to set up a database so that

00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:11,040
the content the CMS part of it can store

00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,870
this data in a database we're going to

00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,500
do that part using our way up

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:18,540
environment which has a PHP my admin web

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,400
interface so that you can add databases

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,920
it's not that complicated and in this

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,230
case all we're going to do with PHP my

00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,480
admin is create a database because we

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,850
got stuck on that installer that says we

00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:32,040
have to so as soon as that's done we're

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:34,140
not going to come back to PHP PHP

00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,870
myadmin because we don't really need to

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:40,550
thankfully but it's there as a tool in

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:42,720
your amp environment so once that's done

00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,100
we're back we're gonna close that tab

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,510
and we're going to come back to our

00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:49,950
installer and we're going to use the

00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:52,500
name of the database that we put in DCC

00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:54,150
local hosts for drupalcamp charlotte the

00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,410
username and password is something that

00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,410
would be provided by your amp

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:02,280
environment and we're going to give it

00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:05,070
those credentials then the next step in

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,290
the kind of wizard setup of Drupal core

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,060
is installing the modules that come with

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:12,000
it and what what it's doing here is

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:14,100
installing all the modules that are in

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,110
that standard profile in that option

00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,030
when we did standard if we if we had

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,370
picked minimal it would install a lot

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:21,990
less but for our purposes and general

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:26,220
purposes standard is what you probably

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:28,320
going to go for next up is the actual

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:31,080
setting up of the kind of configuration

00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,150
and Drupal site information is the basic

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,590
name your site it's what you're going to

00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:37,370
see in the header if you decide to use

00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:40,140
that later the site email address is

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:42,180
outgoing emails what address they come

00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,980
from you know like forgotten passwords

00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:46,860
have to come from an address that's that

00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:48,600
address the site maintenance account

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,360
which is the next section I'm going to

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,310
kind of get ahead of the playback here

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,350
the site maintenance account is the user

00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:57,960
that we're going to do all the

00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:00,390
installations under under that account

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,230
he's the kind of super user or she or it

00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:05,970
is doing everything it can do everything

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,950
in Drupal Drupal has a pretty

00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,840
complicated permissions enroll system

00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:12,030
but we're going to only look at the

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,200
simplest part of it today whether we're

00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:16,410
going to use the site maintenance

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:18,450
account give it a name and username and

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:22,680
password set up a default country and

00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:24,900
and time zone and later we'll look at

00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:26,190
the anonymous account which is the

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,750
person that doesn't even know that you

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,360
can log in or just goes to your site

00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,710
without logging in so there it can get

00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,570
more complicated we're going to keep it

00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:39,450
really simple for this for this demo

00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:45,870
today so in about a less than 10 minutes

00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:47,880
we should have Drupal installed and

00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:49,710
that's the Welcome page so that's not

00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,590
that complicated it could probably be

00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:54,600
more streamlined if you do it the second

00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:56,370
time but and in a sandbox on your local

00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,440
environment it's all just practice so

00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,530
get comfortable with it if you need to

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,690
read go through the process again just

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:05,880
to create a new database create a new

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,260
site or to scratch those things out and

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,180
start over and it's really not that

00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:12,360
complicated shouldn't scare you if

00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:14,190
they've never done it so by default when

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,280
you land on your welcome page after

00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:21,630
installing Drupal your oriented here

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,520
with toolbar at the top a kind of site

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:25,170
maintenance account the guy that's the

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,440
superuser that can do everything gets

00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:30,720
this at the top and a couple hints to

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,070
where you can add content because that's

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,990
the first thing we're going to do the

00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:36,120
goal for us today is to get a site

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,950
that's up that looks kind of like a

00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:40,080
traditional website where you have an

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,640
about us page a contact us page we're

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,130
going to have some views and we're going

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,240
to add media to our site so the first

00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:47,070
thing we're going to do is pretend like

00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,350
we have a client we got one hour to get

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,640
the site built let's go ahead and start

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,090
building it so we're going to use these

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,130
add content leaks and add to one type of

00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:57,960
content you get to with Drupal out of

00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,780
the box you get an article which is kind

00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:03,690
of like a blog post kind of time

00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,550
sensitive content and basic pages basic

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,890
pages are perfect for about us and

00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:11,370
that's what we're going to make you with

00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:13,440
the content type of article or page it

00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:15,270
comes with these fields title and the

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,710
body where you tell the world about us

00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:19,860
and that's what we're just kind of

00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,810
reviewing here it also comes with these

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,120
options and these are options that are

00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,620
related to your content type we're going

00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,180
to go with a lot of the defaults and

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,160
that's what I suggest for beginners

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,620
because there's a ton of options here

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,600
and rather than start tinkering with all

00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,270
of them go with one the ones that are

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,280
set by default for you learn how that

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:41,040
works interact with it and then come

00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:43,290
back and adjust them as you need to so a

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,170
title every every node as they're called

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,850
in Drupal has a title and that's so we

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,040
can find the content look at it later

00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,450
we're going to call it about us we're

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,820
going to use just some placeholder text

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,950
which is known as lorem ipsum it's just

00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:59,550
kind of gibberish just so it looks like

00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:03,060
we actually have an about Us page okay

00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:06,410
so everything cool with audio tahini in

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:10,310
it I don't know if you know it was dude

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:15,340
you got um interference

00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:19,450
like someone else you know to me so

00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,450
where should we all go to that session

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:26,750
okay well if you guys can hear me I can

00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:28,730
tune it out if you can so we've made an

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,740
about Us page where additionally we're

00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,690
using a non-default option of adding a

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,750
menu link a menu link is just going to

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:38,060
give a top shin Thank You Hannah an

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:40,430
option so people can get to your page by

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,680
default you get a type of menu called

00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,960
main menu that comes with Drupal that's

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,060
your main menu that folks will be able

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,529
you can add content to so folks can get

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:50,839
to the link that you're created if we

00:10:48,529 --> 00:10:52,670
didn't do that it'd be it would land you

00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:54,200
back on the about Us page that you just

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,750
corrected but you wouldn't have this

00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:00,380
this option this is what the main menu

00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:03,740
is so by default Drupal is going to give

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:06,710
you the the note that you just create in

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:09,110
the view version of it and then later if

00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,270
you'd like you can edit in case you made

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,390
of error something this is called I

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:16,490
think inline editing so we'll see here

00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:19,310
we can edit that link and go I can make

00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:22,430
a change if we have to which is the kind

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:24,140
of it's different than other CMS is when

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,490
you're actually viewing the content you

00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:27,290
decide you want to edit it with the

00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:28,580
right privileges as the site maintenance

00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,140
account you can do it right there on

00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:34,960
screen to make a little faster for you

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:34,960
and easier hopefully so

00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:45,490
we're going to hop over here in chrome

00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:47,620
as what I what's known as incognito

00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,990
window how many of you use chrome show

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,940
hands it's a it's a nice browser has

00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:55,900
this nice feature Firefox has one I

00:11:51,940 --> 00:12:02,260
don't know about explore the incognito

00:11:55,900 --> 00:12:04,840
window is a good I think the key is that

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:07,420
that's what incognito the incognito

00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:09,310
window looks like in front just gets

00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,320
this title bar that's blue needs a

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,090
little private eye guy on the far right

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,740
side this is really good for you want to

00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:16,540
stop where you are with your site and

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,430
see what it looks like for people that

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,170
have never been to your site or if

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,330
you're going in as the anonymous user

00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:25,540
that's an actual type of user in Drupal

00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:28,090
it's got a user ID of 0 and this is what

00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:30,490
they see they can log in they can see

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:32,530
your about Us page and that's really all

00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,940
they can do but in about 15 minutes you

00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,800
got a home page and you got an about Us

00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,080
page and it doesn't look terrible right

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,270
now it's using this default blue it's

00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:41,710
called Bartik theme and we're going to

00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,990
we're going to work on changing that as

00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:45,670
well but it's kind of good to go back

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:46,870
and forth between your and maintenance

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,360
account the one you're doing all your

00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,800
content authoring in and your anonymous

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,620
view and keep that person in mind

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,270
because those two perception and the

00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,710
things you see on the page or it very

00:12:55,270 --> 00:13:00,970
different for them a lot of times

00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:04,150
especially as you add more modules if we

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,780
look up in the address bar our excuse me

00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:11,110
the main nu bar BC that about us was

00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:12,970
before home that's that's something you

00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:14,890
can change by going to the structure of

00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:17,500
your site which is up in the toolbar and

00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:19,510
then looking at the menus option there's

00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,220
four menus that come with Drupal the

00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:24,490
main menu is the one we added our

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,230
content to it's really simple to reorder

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,490
and drag around the order of those

00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:30,339
things that I'm showing you here an

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,970
example of putting home above about us

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:35,650
so that shows up before I think most

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:37,600
websites would do it that way would you

00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,520
go home left to right and about us and

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,530
as we add more content we'll come back

00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,230
and use that menu links administration

00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:46,300
page to kind of structure it the way we

00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,700
want to see visually for the user in the

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,579
menu system so now we have home and

00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,259
about us as we

00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:54,239
we're going to that kind of traditional

00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,769
client website was sort of a brochure

00:13:54,239 --> 00:13:57,569
site users aren't going to really log

00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:59,579
into our site we're just building a site

00:13:57,569 --> 00:14:01,110
in one hour to get it out there for a

00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,089
client because we want to make a quick

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:07,739
five hundred bucks and skip lunch or

00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:10,049
something like that I don't know so one

00:14:07,739 --> 00:14:12,809
thing we can do if I hop back into the

00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:15,569
Edit of about us and we'll go to the URL

00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:18,420
path settings what I'm changing here is

00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:21,569
the address bar right now I can put in

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,759
some free text in the URL alias option

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:26,730
and if you look in the address bar we

00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,980
just switched from what was node / 1

00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:31,559
which is how Drupal stores all of the

00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:34,230
paths inside it that's all Drupal can

00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,970
find the content that you add you can

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:37,920
change that so it's more SEO friendly

00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:41,279
enough in the address bar says about

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,739
dash us you can do that manually which

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,929
is what we've just done or you can also

00:14:43,739 --> 00:14:48,720
make it this is what i consider URL

00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:50,309
aliases the hard way we're going to come

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,410
back to that in a moment and change it

00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:56,369
the easy way by adding a contribute at

00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,949
before we do that I want to show you

00:14:56,369 --> 00:15:02,850
what adding a different kind of content

00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:04,709
type in Drupal known as a blog or an

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:06,439
article this is time sensitive content

00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:08,610
reham what what's going on here is that

00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:10,199
you're adding the same thing you did

00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:13,110
just for about us you're going to give

00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,819
it a title and then additionally you

00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,819
have a tags we're not going to use tags

00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:21,540
in our demo today but a content type

00:15:17,819 --> 00:15:23,850
that adds tags is just it's just a

00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:25,319
different it's the same process but

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,089
you've got tags and you've got an image

00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:28,709
in this case so there's different fields

00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:32,059
for different types of content that's

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:34,829
that's the most flexible option with

00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:37,199
Drupal is to be able to extend it and

00:15:34,829 --> 00:15:38,879
add content types like a new one of your

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,860
own and give it fields we're going to

00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:44,279
see that in a second but right here

00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:46,860
we're going to skip the URL path aliases

00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,959
so if we go back and we save our new

00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,989
article and we look in the address bar

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,839
it says no / 2 so Drupal's building up

00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:55,390
this the system of knowing what content

00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,610
is

00:15:55,390 --> 00:16:00,400
referred to as nodes and noo tidies

00:15:57,610 --> 00:16:01,840
which is the two part of that address so

00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,230
I'm going to hop into fast-forward mode

00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:07,900
motion here and add two more blog

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:11,170
entries and show you how we can stop

00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,120
putting in manually URL aliases so we

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,880
don't have to send our friends or our

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,360
new link to our blog post and say here

00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:21,010
it is check it out it's GCC localhost /

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,340
nodes last three or whatever like that

00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,080
so we're adding three blog entries just

00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:30,090
to get some real quick content into our

00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:30,090
system and then we're going to add a

00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,220
contributory so that everything comes

00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,470
out SEO friendly and looks better in the

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,080
address bar that map that module is

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,670
called path auto or up we're going to do

00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,970
that next but before we do let's look

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,790
back at our homepage as our incognito

00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:51,070
view in google chrome you don't see all

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:53,710
of this content is showing up now on the

00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:55,750
home page of your drupal site that's a

00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:58,210
that's a feature that comes with drupal

00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:00,220
by default all the content you add your

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:02,110
site shows up on the home page and

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:03,880
that's called a content stream or the

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,130
river of news or something like that

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,170
it's an option we're going to change but

00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:11,470
before we do that let's fix that path

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,730
auto issue so i think i'm still in fast

00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,740
forward let me slow down just a little

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:16,959
bit going back to dribble org and

00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,240
download extend this time we we switch

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,740
to the modules to add so you know I

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,699
think we're still in fast forward and

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:26,740
i'm downloading path auto really quickly

00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:31,150
we've unzipped them on our local folder

00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:35,490
we've read the readme files right didn't

00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:37,630
we all read those and back to our

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,910
maintenance account we're going to go to

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,500
modules we're going to see all the list

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,570
of modules that we currently have

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,760
unzipped in our sites all module folder

00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:47,950
we have this new one called chaos tools

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:50,320
sweet let's imagine that wasn't there

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,020
and that we forgot it if we went down

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,390
here to the views section and we enabled

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,130
the two required modules views you I so

00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:58,840
we have an interface to build a view and

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,250
views which is the main module you need

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,350
you see there's a dependency called

00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:05,050
chaos tools at that point you could go

00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,550
in able it or say you forgot you could

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,539
just go ahead and hit save configuration

00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,739
and

00:18:07,539 --> 00:18:11,229
it's going to say wait a minute there's

00:18:08,739 --> 00:18:13,659
a dependency here because again contribs

00:18:11,229 --> 00:18:17,139
are borrowing from other controls to

00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:19,059
kind of reuse functionality and this is

00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:22,450
an example where views has to use chaos

00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:23,859
tools to do so so we've done that or

00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,779
we've gone back to Drupal because we

00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:27,580
forgot chaos to chaos tools we've

00:18:25,779 --> 00:18:30,639
unpacked it we've got it on our machine

00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:32,499
and we're installing it that's all there

00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:34,029
is to installing modules you see how

00:18:32,499 --> 00:18:35,950
site building becomes that kind of

00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,749
ritual of going to drupal org and

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:39,460
finding the stuff you need and then

00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,859
trying it out in your sandbox after

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:45,129
you've after you've enabled it views

00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:47,080
comes under structure so it after you've

00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:49,539
read the readme you kind of most read me

00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,940
tell you where to go to use and then set

00:18:49,539 --> 00:18:53,679
up the module and in this case views is

00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,859
adding structure to our site it's

00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,809
putting content into lists by default

00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:00,789
there's a couple views that come with

00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:02,289
Drupal we're going to leave those as is

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,059
because we're kind of learning and we

00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:06,399
want to go with the simple stuff so

00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:08,649
we're going to add a new one all we're

00:19:06,399 --> 00:19:11,649
doing here is given a machine name or

00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:13,359
kind of name to get back to your list it

00:19:11,649 --> 00:19:15,759
would this with what show up in the list

00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,979
of views and here we're creating a page

00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,200
because we need a page for users to get

00:19:17,979 --> 00:19:22,989
to our three blog entries that we

00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,080
created the page itself will get a page

00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:27,729
title it since it's not really content

00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:31,899
it comes with a passo there's another

00:19:27,729 --> 00:19:33,309
URL aliases for just the list and we'll

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,659
go with all the defaults that are here

00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:36,820
on the option except we're going to add

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:39,669
a menu link so that people can get to

00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,049
the list of blogs and this is the label

00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:45,519
will call it what would it be called our

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:47,830
blog save and exit in your view at this

00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,690
point is done and it since we chose a

00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:51,789
menu link it's going to actually show up

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:55,629
in the menu link and now we have our

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:58,690
content back so that's that's the very

00:19:55,629 --> 00:20:00,460
simple flow of adding views you can see

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,859
here there's a problem it's still kind

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,019
of like our river of content that was on

00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:07,599
our homepage it's showing about us it's

00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:09,820
showing a homepage it would show any

00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,169
type of content you've added but we

00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:13,389
don't want it to so we're going to use a

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,099
shortcut to get back to our view we

00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:17,760
could go back under structure at the top

00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:20,070
but if you hover over your view as the

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,350
right site administrator who has access

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,360
to views there's a little quick shortcut

00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:26,370
in the gear icon in the top right of the

00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,650
view to edit the view right there in

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,270
line again as inline editing to keep it

00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,970
simple and get you work and quick

00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:35,520
there's a filter that we can add to that

00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:37,290
and since we know it's the type of kind

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,210
of filter we're going to filter out all

00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:43,680
these options you get with views and

00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:45,390
just use type so I know content type is

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:47,730
what I want to filter out and I only

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:50,340
show want to show this list of content

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:52,200
on my site of a certain content type and

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:54,030
now I'm going to check off article which

00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,660
is that content type which is our blog

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:59,340
in our case views is kind of a working

00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,440
state so all of this is sort of in

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,450
memory and stored temporarily until you

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,860
hit save so you get kind of a staging

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,740
work area while you're working with

00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:10,740
views and that's all there is to getting

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:14,130
a list of content on your site filtered

00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,380
out by a specific kind of content in our

00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:19,080
case three blog entries and a list of

00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,640
blogs with a menu link and it's not too

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,530
much to setting up views so you can

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,140
imagine as you add more content to your

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:28,020
site maybe you had an event content type

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:30,450
or some other you know something special

00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:32,550
and unique to your site just pair it

00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,740
with adding a page display of a view

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,870
filter it out by that content type go

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,640
with the defaults and that's all there

00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,900
is to getting that list of content on

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,880
your site and it comes with a lot of

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,650
bonus features like paging and you can

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,810
set up different layouts for it could be

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,570
in a grid layout it could be in a block

00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,250
clay out so there's we don't have time

00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:56,700
to cover all that but it's not too much

00:21:50,250 --> 00:22:00,090
to setting up views itself next up let's

00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,860
look back at our anonymous view it looks

00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,290
the same except now we've got the

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,990
homepage it's our home page we've got

00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:09,150
the about Us page it's the clients about

00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:13,650
Us page and we've got this our blog link

00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:16,080
with three blog entries and three actual

00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:18,950
blog post details we can get around to

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,710
it so it's not too you know in about

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:25,500
less than 30 minutes we've got a huge

00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:27,270
list of let's say press releases where

00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,550
our blogs if we used it that way about

00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:31,000
Us page and home page that's that's not

00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:33,460
a whole lot to get a

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,150
website standing up in front of folks

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,260
that are anonymous in my book it doesn't

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:40,960
look that great but we're going to try

00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,760
to change that pretty quickly you could

00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,990
go with this out of the box we're going

00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,810
to add another contribute in touch with

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:52,030
us it's a contact us form in our case

00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:54,280
this is a module that a lot of people

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:57,220
use to gather data or gather questions

00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:58,870
from your anonymous users or registered

00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:00,970
users in that case and that's called web

00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:03,040
form web form is a really powerful

00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,780
module for doing that it makes it really

00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,240
easy to do it so we're setting that up

00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,250
in the same old formula where we go off

00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,620
to the modules page get the latest

00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:15,220
recommended release unzip it on our

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:18,850
sites all modules folder and install it

00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:22,030
so it's let's fast forward same formula

00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:26,340
clean it up some trash go to the modules

00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:29,860
page an able view excuse me webform

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:35,290
would find it on our collapse down here

00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:38,050
and we save since you've read the readme

00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:40,750
now know what to do webform adds

00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:43,030
structure to your site so web form gives

00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,950
you a new content type we used to have

00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,860
articles we used to have pages and now

00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:51,130
we have web form when we go into content

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:54,700
types as a content type itself so that's

00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,770
a that's a contributing upon core in its

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,170
way says I want to make web form its own

00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:02,110
content type so when we go into add

00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:04,270
content now we can add a web form all

00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,220
content types with Drupal again come

00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,890
with a title and a body so what we're

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:10,330
going to do is fill out those things by

00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,620
default because we know we got to give

00:24:10,330 --> 00:24:13,630
it a title so what we see it in the

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,790
content list of our site we can edit it

00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,290
we know how to call it we don't have to

00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:20,500
give it a body but we're going to do so

00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:22,150
in this case and again a menu link so

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,980
we're just going for efficiency we're

00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:25,900
just trying to get a contact us form up

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,310
we're going with these defaults we're

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,950
going to put it in the main menu so

00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:32,290
everybody can get to it and then next

00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,880
we're going to actually configure web

00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,850
form and show you a little bit about

00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:40,810
what it does and how it gathers results

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:42,279
from the in its functionality so web

00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:45,940
form gives you

00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:47,229
if you if you only added the content

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,119
type in it wasn't webform you'd only

00:24:47,229 --> 00:24:50,799
have view and edit but webform builds

00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,139
upon that functionality by giving you

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,090
these extra tabs and now we're going to

00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:56,529
add questions we've read the readme and

00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,349
we know that questions are really called

00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:01,179
form components internally adding a

00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:03,929
field to web form is as simple as giving

00:25:01,179 --> 00:25:07,440
a name making it required and giving a

00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:10,389
moat just accept most of the defaults

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,049
just to collect a name from your users

00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:16,989
on your form so we're going to do the

00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:19,359
same thing with email there's types of

00:25:16,989 --> 00:25:21,070
fields you can collect from your users

00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,169
in web form they don't have to be text

00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:25,539
fields emails can actually be email

00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:26,799
fields and do the validation for you so

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:28,779
you don't have to worry about someone

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,639
putting in a non email address and a

00:25:28,779 --> 00:25:32,889
text field for you that's really handy

00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:35,979
and useful and there's there's there's

00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:37,899
radio check boxes and any kind of form

00:25:35,979 --> 00:25:39,999
element that you normally collect input

00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:42,309
is available in web form and then you

00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:45,339
can add your own own as well if you want

00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:46,929
to write code so a text area is the

00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:48,279
final thing we're going to grab from our

00:25:46,929 --> 00:25:50,409
users we're going to make them all

00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:52,029
mandatory fields for users to fill out

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:54,609
and we're just kind of going through the

00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:57,009
workflow of web form we've saved the

00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:58,749
components and what this has done is

00:25:57,009 --> 00:26:00,700
it's tacked on these three form

00:25:58,749 --> 00:26:03,039
components to our node which is the

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,159
content type we added a web form so if

00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:08,679
we go back and view that we go to our

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,759
home page and view contact us since we

00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:16,839
gave it a menu link we should see a web

00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:20,649
form and here we do we've got a contact

00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:23,460
us form and inadvertently we also have a

00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:27,879
comments form at the bottom of our

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:31,149
contact us form which is weird but since

00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:35,849
the content type of web form as one of

00:26:31,149 --> 00:26:38,229
the settings has left commenting on

00:26:35,849 --> 00:26:40,330
we're going to edit that so you can kind

00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:42,369
of cherry pick you can set rules for

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,969
your content types that say have

00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:47,979
comments be enabled on or off by default

00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:50,349
and then you can go into the content

00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:53,259
itself like a single instance of a web

00:26:50,349 --> 00:26:54,320
form in our case contact us page and go

00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,090
into edit

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,649
is what we just did we've gone in there

00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,779
and said don't show comments on my

00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:02,090
comment form because it doesn't make

00:26:59,779 --> 00:27:04,730
sense I guess it could make sense if you

00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:10,279
have that if you like living in the

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:12,559
bazaar so contact us it looks good to

00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:15,440
the anonymous user and we're going to

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,899
fill out some data just to show you how

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,580
it looks oh I think actually we're going

00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:22,100
to restructure we didn't like where it

00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:24,080
showed up in the menu so we're going to

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,450
drag and drop contact us so it's at the

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,580
end of the list using structure main

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,980
menus and reordering the menus you could

00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,740
also do this by hand if you want to do

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,649
it numerically by setting the weight

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:39,080
when you add the content so contact us

00:27:36,649 --> 00:27:42,679
as the anonymous viewer filling in some

00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:44,840
random fake data for nobody want to show

00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,870
you how easy it is to collect data from

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:50,269
your users and use that data back in the

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:52,370
site maintenance account so if we hop

00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:54,620
back we've collected data someone's

00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:58,879
filled out our form we go back to our

00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,850
form there's a results tab right here

00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:03,799
which is really useful in that it's

00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:06,259
going to aggregate all of the data in

00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:08,539
some reporting options for you so here's

00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:11,960
a list view of a single submission and I

00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:14,600
can view it I can edit and delete it as

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,169
well and see all the comments that of

00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,799
the guy that just dropped by and then

00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:23,419
lastly there's some really good

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,769
secondary options with web form under

00:28:23,419 --> 00:28:29,899
results that allow us to do analysis on

00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:32,690
how each person filled out each

00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:34,190
component of our form if you had a bunch

00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:35,450
of components and you're doing polling

00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,549
data or something like that you could

00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,409
review that there you could also see it

00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:42,259
in a table format you can also download

00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:44,750
it and export it as Excel and give it to

00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:46,879
your boss or whatever you need to do

00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:49,370
with you at that information all right

00:28:46,879 --> 00:28:52,480
we're trying to I'm talking a lot so I'm

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,480
going to pause for a drink of water

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,060
yeah one of the options in web form

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,100
under when you set up the web form there

00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,130
was a sub tab they're called email

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,530
settings email settings are what to do

00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:11,390
when users fill out your form you can

00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:13,250
have an auto respond right to them and

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,940
you can there's a text field for you to

00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:18,470
put in what you want to say back to them

00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,570
you can have it notify you there's a lot

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,370
of options in there so just when you

00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:23,690
when you read the readme and when you

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,280
poke around in there and some of the

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:27,140
options i skimmed by i look through that

00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:29,690
it's under i think it's under forum

00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,610
settings or sundar email excuse me

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,140
there's emails and forum settings the

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:34,790
forum settings will give you like Thank

00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:37,130
You response messages and things like

00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:41,570
that so you can customize pretty much

00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:45,350
anything you want in web forum here we

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:47,270
go we're going to add our own content

00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,930
type so far we've been going with

00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:54,050
articles and blogs or blog post and

00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:56,150
regular pages and web forum gave us its

00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:58,190
own content type but that doesn't stop

00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:59,900
you from making your own and in our case

00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,460
we're going to try to get a little bit

00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,650
of multimedia on our site we're going to

00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:06,410
add a video content type so let's say we

00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:08,180
have as one site one specific function

00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:11,060
of showing some video because that's

00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:13,390
what our sites about is right here

00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:15,980
setting up a content type is pretty much

00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,470
deciding what options you want to be

00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:20,840
available when a new user adds content I

00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:22,400
say new users that's really us in this

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:27,020
case we're the site maintenance account

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:29,120
but if should you gave other authors a

00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:32,330
way to add content these are all the

00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,130
defaults that they see so think about it

00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,830
that way when you're setting up new

00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:38,780
content types and new content types are

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,610
just buckets way to categorize your

00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,830
content and you can extend it and do

00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:45,080
what you want so say we're going to do a

00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,820
list of videos on our site what we're

00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,830
doing here is we're setting up a content

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:51,080
type called video and we're just giving

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,220
it some default options like can people

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:56,570
comment on it is it published by default

00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,360
what is it going to live in the main

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:01,190
menu and by default and of course when

00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,810
they add that content they can change

00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:05,630
any of that but these are just kind of

00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:06,600
the rules to put in place as the content

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,910
type as a

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,820
basic page as an article in our case as

00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:14,179
a video so we're given it a name and a

00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:16,980
label so when you go to add the content

00:31:14,179 --> 00:31:19,289
you'll see these things next when we go

00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,030
to do it it's a video so we're probably

00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:22,410
going to be missing the actual video

00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:25,049
which is what i'm going to show you next

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,720
but kind of merging that into what it

00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:30,600
looks like at this point I'll also add a

00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,340
content type so now adding the content

00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:34,710
type it now shows up when you go to add

00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:38,549
content on your site and you can give it

00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:39,900
a title we'll call it my video and we'll

00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:41,010
give that some text I'm going to speed

00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,840
through this because we've seen it a

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,700
couple times at this point we're going

00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,440
to give this a menu link just so we can

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,870
quickly get it up on our page and

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,669
everybody can see our video we'll call

00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:54,570
it my video we'll leave it right where

00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:58,760
it is as far as the parent menu and we

00:31:54,570 --> 00:32:03,030
see it okay what's missing right so

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,210
adding a video requires going to dribble

00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:10,140
org and getting a recommended release

00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:13,260
for Drupal 7 is the media module this is

00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,809
a really handy module for adding media

00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:17,820
to your site it'll handle audio it'll

00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:20,100
handle video you know it'll actually

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,780
handle files for you pretty well it's

00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,490
got a lot to it we're going to keep it

00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,470
really simple because we have one sole

00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:27,659
purpose for it to show videos to our

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,090
site you could substitute audio in there

00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:35,580
for that all we're doing here is going

00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:37,350
to the media contribs page we've read

00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,000
through all of its documentation which

00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,130
is actually pretty good on this site and

00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,250
it says there's a known issue here which

00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:46,919
is really just information audio and

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,230
videos by default won't be shown unless

00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,419
we go grab this recommended module here

00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:53,610
called media front there's there's six

00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:55,679
hundred ways to do this i think in media

00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:58,230
but this is what's recommended and i

00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,510
found like this is the easiest i got the

00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,909
other releases version the one in yellow

00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:05,039
here because it has more functionality

00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:06,600
and you don't necessarily always have to

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,429
go with a recommended release the one

00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,020
that's in green if you know what you're

00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,610
doing you've read up there's features

00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:14,130
you might want to go with the other

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:16,260
releases or even the dev version but

00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:20,419
chances are you better staying in the

00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:22,429
green for for the media module

00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:27,429
sorry if I keep my must be hitting this

00:33:22,429 --> 00:33:29,989
or something yeah I'm cool alright so

00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:34,489
we're going to grab media front module

00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:36,440
and the media module itself so we'll

00:33:34,489 --> 00:33:38,359
kind of speed through this because we've

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,029
seen it several times where site

00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:43,789
builders now this is all stuff we've

00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:49,129
done before so the goal here is to get a

00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:51,169
field added to our content type of video

00:33:49,129 --> 00:33:54,889
and we need media front and all these

00:33:51,169 --> 00:33:57,499
related modules to do so and that's all

00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:59,179
we've done here now if we go back to

00:33:57,499 --> 00:34:04,669
structure and we go back to content

00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:06,409
types and we just talked about and we go

00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:09,559
back to manage fields we skip this

00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:11,299
option before managing fields these are

00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:13,280
the fields that come with the content

00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,139
type by default we know everything's had

00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,569
a title we've already talked about you

00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,339
or he'll pass for that and as a body you

00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:21,379
can optionally take away body from your

00:34:19,339 --> 00:34:23,329
content type but the best part about it

00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:25,549
is you can add fields to your content

00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:27,589
type add new field and we're going to we

00:34:25,549 --> 00:34:29,659
need a feel for people to upload video

00:34:27,589 --> 00:34:32,059
so in our case this is going to be a

00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,740
file field so there's all kinds of types

00:34:32,059 --> 00:34:36,429
of fields you can add to your content

00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:39,319
type you could add images or list or

00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:42,200
references to other content or just

00:34:39,319 --> 00:34:45,069
plain text in our case a video file is a

00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,720
file so we're going to call it that and

00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:49,399
this is when you go to add content

00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,980
you're actually see this field now

00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:54,470
widgets are over here on the third

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:57,139
fourth column widgets are ways to

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,869
interact with that field in the media

00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:01,280
module built upon this functionality by

00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:03,559
giving us something called the media

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,260
file selector it's a really useful

00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:08,540
module so when we go to add the field

00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:11,839
and the video itself will have some

00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:17,510
really cool interface to do so or pretty

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:19,069
cool i should say all right so i'm just

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,170
going through the secondary steps

00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:22,730
there's a little bit more just to setup

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,200
of this you might want to watch this

00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,960
back in your playback but we're actually

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,819
setting up media front module so we have

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,369
a way to display this while we're at it

00:35:28,819 --> 00:35:33,830
it's really just two options tell this

00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:38,900
field type of the video file to be

00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:40,640
a media front enabled field and then in

00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:43,280
here these are regular settings for the

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:48,320
file field type to say allow people to

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,810
upload in mpeg-4 mp4 in our case so most

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,190
of it is is stuff we need to come back

00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:54,170
and review but we're going to go with

00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,320
the defaults and only do what we have to

00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:59,330
to get a video playing on our site so

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,270
media modules very powerful we're

00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:06,230
skimming the options and going the

00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:08,090
defaults now we've got our field and if

00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,680
we go back to our content itself we

00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:13,370
should be able to edit that field at

00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:19,880
this point we can upload the video file

00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:21,860
itself so this is the what adding a

00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:24,530
field of your content content type does

00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:26,930
it gives you more stuff to fill out when

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,370
you add the content and on the flip side

00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,530
of that you get to figure out how you're

00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:33,110
going to show that to the audience this

00:36:30,530 --> 00:36:35,540
is the the cool interface for picking

00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:37,250
the media if it was a file you could

00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,170
actually just do the regular upload but

00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:41,270
media module that allows you to upload

00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,550
pull things from the web and you can

00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,930
also use a library of things local on

00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:47,330
your site we're going to go with the

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,850
easier one which is just to upload but

00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:52,160
preparing for the future we can add

00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,500
videos from the web or from other parts

00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:00,050
of our site I'm picking a random video I

00:36:54,500 --> 00:37:02,270
found on archive.org of 1950s party

00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:04,220
etiquette etiquette for women named

00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:08,060
Cindy it's called Cindy goes to a party

00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,100
this is our sample video what what it

00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:12,290
does at this point it just shows you

00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:14,780
media module just shows you icon of it

00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:16,460
and if you save the node it brings you

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:19,310
back to the view display of your node

00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:22,220
and the problem here is that since it's

00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:24,110
a file and the field type of file it

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:25,910
only lists the file which isn't that

00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,980
helpful unless you want a site that does

00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:30,320
that just to put files out there for the

00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:33,230
public to download so there's one extra

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:35,600
step here using the media front module

00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:38,120
we are we've read the readme of media

00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:41,000
front and we know to actually I forgot

00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:42,860
in my demo to enable the open standards

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,250
player which is the video player media

00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:47,450
front uses so that's under modules we've

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,000
enabled that and we

00:37:47,450 --> 00:37:51,710
to go to the structure and set up media

00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,520
front and that's what I'm doing here I'm

00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:57,260
going to media font presets and we're

00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,690
adding a preset I know this is really

00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,790
fast because we're running out of time

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,200
it's basically here's what your preset

00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:04,670
will look like this is what your player

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,160
will look like you have options for

00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,320
configuring media front players for all

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,750
so you have you could have a black

00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:15,230
player or a white player different skins

00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:18,950
and themes for your html5 ready player

00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:20,720
here that's a requirement to get now get

00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:23,840
that field that we've added to our video

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,550
content type a way to present the data

00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:29,420
so when every time we present the video

00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:31,850
now if we go to manage display of our

00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,890
content type which is the output so you

00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,590
put fields into your content type and

00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:39,170
you give them something a way to to show

00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:41,120
them going out to the world by default

00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,070
it was just showing the generic file

00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,420
we're going to change that and since

00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,780
we've already done the work and setting

00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:50,720
up media front and media front players

00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:52,340
it's an option in the display for matter

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,920
which is that kind of outgoing

00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:57,110
presentation for the world and by

00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,940
picking that it'll bring up the players

00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:01,760
that we set up so here we've only got

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,830
one it's the black skin that the default

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,170
one that comes with media front so it's

00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:08,480
pretty easy to do that a lot of steps

00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:10,220
involved but go back if you want to

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,990
watch this video and just play it a

00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:18,790
little slower and you'll get a follow

00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:20,960
along hopefully so the last part of this

00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:23,480
there you go if you go back to the view

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,520
you should have a video and now we can

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,380
watch Cindy goes to a party from the

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,840
1950s we're not going to do that part I

00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:35,410
think

00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,660
there's also a link of that yeah so

00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:40,990
we're 1130 I've gone over by six minutes

00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:42,760
I can take up your time or you can go if

00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,210
you're ready to go the next part I'm

00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,480
going to do is is blaze you through

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,610
adding a thumbnail to Cindy goes to a

00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:53,650
party so that when you come to the node

00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:55,360
page there'll be an image there to a

00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,610
kind of poster frame you've heard it

00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,010
referred to maybe as a poster frame so

00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:02,050
that looks good before you users hit

00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:04,630
play and then lastly I'm going to

00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:06,940
install a base theme if you're in

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:09,040
Thomas's session he was highly

00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:10,810
suggesting sub-themes I'm going to

00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,660
install a base theme called adaptive

00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:17,190
theme which is html5 theme that's

00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:19,780
responsive tablet ready mobile ready and

00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:22,210
then a sub-theme of that called sky

00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:24,340
theme and sky theme has a plethora of

00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:25,690
options for you to go home and tweak so

00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:28,540
if you're trying to build a site in one

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,250
hour you want to maybe use these themes

00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,630
as a starting place because when you see

00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:34,060
the settings of this you can change

00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,700
everything from fonts to colors to add

00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:39,490
your own logos and I really don't think

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:42,310
I can talk as talk us through all that

00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:43,630
without I don't think we have time for

00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:48,640
that so I'm going to just going to play

00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:50,470
playthrough what that looks like i'll

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,270
kind of narrate as best i can i'm adding

00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:54,430
a for media front you have to do a

00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:57,670
thumbnail which is an additional field

00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,950
go through the defaults set up a media

00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:03,850
front setting of image type assign it a

00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:06,580
style and upfront give it a PNG jpg or

00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:08,950
gif at this point you're you have a new

00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,600
field editor your content type we're

00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,640
going to change it to hidden so when

00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:14,980
it's displayed the world doesn't see it

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,370
but media front is smart enough to know

00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:21,520
when we upload which I'm doing here a

00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:23,080
JPEG of the poster frame it's going to

00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,570
link those two things together and now

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,000
that jpg is there before you start the

00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,280
actual playback which is pretty pretty

00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,960
helpful so at this point we're going to

00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:33,880
go get adaptive theme i'm going to go

00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,510
really quick adapter themes a good base

00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,970
theme it's html5 friendly it's

00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:42,850
responsive and sky theme is a pretty

00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:45,430
good starter sub-theme with a lot of

00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:45,999
theme settings and options installing

00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:47,319
them

00:41:45,999 --> 00:41:49,389
we did everything all the installs and

00:41:47,319 --> 00:41:52,419
their sites all themes instead of sites

00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:55,539
all modules that you you'd know that by

00:41:52,419 --> 00:41:58,599
looking at the readme we're enabling the

00:41:55,539 --> 00:42:01,599
base theme of adaptive theme core and

00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:03,309
the sky theme we've done all this under

00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,309
appearance in our site maintenance

00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:08,769
account and if we go and refresh our

00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:14,049
content it's kind of vanilla by default

00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:17,019
which is the options that come with Sky

00:42:14,049 --> 00:42:18,759
theme and there's a blocks page you kind

00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:20,079
of have to reassign content I don't have

00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:22,629
time to talk about this because we're

00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,129
running out of time but blocks are bits

00:42:22,629 --> 00:42:26,529
and pieces around your content and

00:42:24,129 --> 00:42:28,539
reassigning them to places within your

00:42:26,529 --> 00:42:31,269
themes or regions all we're doing here

00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:33,309
is we're taking the main menu which 1i

00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:35,499
enabled the sky theme there it is it's

00:42:33,309 --> 00:42:36,939
being responsive can you tell people do

00:42:35,499 --> 00:42:39,009
that all the time to say hey is this

00:42:36,939 --> 00:42:41,019
responsive just drag it around and find

00:42:39,009 --> 00:42:42,489
out look at all these options you get

00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:45,459
with sky theme if you wanted to build a

00:42:42,489 --> 00:42:46,749
client site in one hour and you and you

00:42:45,459 --> 00:42:48,429
wanted a theme it for them while you're

00:42:46,749 --> 00:42:51,279
there or let them do it these are all

00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:53,109
the options you're going to do to change

00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:55,089
the look and feel of sky settings and

00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,369
there's a ton rounded-corners fonts

00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:59,079
layouts breadcrumbs search results

00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,789
everything you see listed here all

00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:02,529
configurable and then you can

00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:04,749
cherry-pick different colors for

00:43:02,529 --> 00:43:06,849
different parts of your site and it's

00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:08,409
not too bad a theme if you if you if

00:43:06,849 --> 00:43:10,449
this isn't good enough for you you

00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:12,669
either go look at other themes on

00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:14,379
drupal.org or you you know talk to

00:43:12,669 --> 00:43:16,389
someone that does theming or come two

00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:18,669
more sessions so you come to Sharda get

00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:19,989
the first Wednesday of every month and

00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:22,989
you ask these questions and we'll hook

00:43:19,989 --> 00:43:24,489
you up so that's it this is what it

00:43:22,989 --> 00:43:26,709
looks like when you're done it's purple

00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:29,019
I didn't have time to make it really

00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:31,779
shiny bells and whistles but this is all

00:43:29,019 --> 00:43:33,969
the content you've added and just

00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:36,759
installing a theme and tweaking it out

00:43:33,969 --> 00:43:39,429
to use sky theme and change the colors a

00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:42,869
little bit and I think my mouth is dry

00:43:39,429 --> 00:43:42,869
so I'm done

00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:51,410
you

00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,930
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,150
ago we could not have imagined that

00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:04,370
asterisk would not only become the most

00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:06,500
widely adopted open source communication

00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:08,540
software on the planet but that it would

00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:11,060
impact the entire industry in the way

00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:13,040
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:15,680
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,630
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,730
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,140
transition of power from the hands of

00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:23,390
the traditional proprietary phone

00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,790
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:27,740
administrators of phone systems using

00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,970
this power our customers have created

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,920
all sorts of business changing

00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,750
applications from small office phone

00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,270
systems to mission-critical call centres

00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:36,860
to international carrier networks in

00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:38,660
fact there's even an entire country

00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:41,060
those communications infrastructure runs

00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,190
on esters the gym has always been about

00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,900
creating technology that expands

00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:47,060
communications capabilities in ways that

00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:48,260
we could never have imagined and that's

00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,020
part of what's game-changing about

00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:53,360
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:55,460
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,560
IP phones that extends control of the

00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:59,330
user all the way to the desktop the

00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,040
launch of these new products represents

00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:03,110
the next phase indigenous history of

00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,540
innovation these are the first and only

00:45:03,110 --> 00:45:07,250
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,780
power of estrus when we first discussed

00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,820
our expectations for building a family

00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:12,980
of phones for use with asterisk our

00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:14,720
requirements were pretty simple we asked

00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,340
the team to build the phones such that

00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:18,560
they were easy to install integrate

00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:20,390
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,970
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:24,590
that goal user feedback is validating

00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:26,720
that when it comes to operation with

00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:29,120
astro space systems including our own

00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,700
Switchvox based product these are the

00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:33,020
easiest to use best integrated most

00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:35,240
interoperable products on the market

00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:37,370
today the digit and family of phones

00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:39,500
will initially include three IP des

00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:41,210
hommes uniquely designed to complement

00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:43,190
any asterisk or switch box based

00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:45,830
solution these phones are different for

00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:47,770
a number of reasons first there is clue

00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:50,210
sively designed for use with esters

00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:51,820
secondly we've made it really easy to

00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,200
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:55,910
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:57,870
to access information inside of

00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:59,840
asterisks allowing tight coupling

00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,830
between an application and the phone

00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,990
additionally we've created an

00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:06,120
applications engineer that allows users

00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:09,330
and developers to create and run their

00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,100
own apps on the phone and finally we've

00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,080
done all of this at a very compelling

00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:14,730
price point at Digium we're always

00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,830
thinking of ways to give our customers

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,410
the best value in business phone systems

00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,970
and also give them the power to create

00:46:19,410 --> 00:46:23,100
their own solutions or any

00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:24,840
communications challenge well continue

00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,250
to push the boundaries not only to make

00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,320
astros cooler faster and more

00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:29,940
technologically feature-rich but to make

00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:32,400
asterisk employed communications even

00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:36,110
easier and together we'll change the way

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,110
the world communication again

00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:24,000
how's that sigh every way this is the

00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,190
way to better utilize all your resources

00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,640
and it makes managing all your resources

00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:33,470
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:36,990
happening in open source the

00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:38,790
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:40,890
of the community and the speed at which

00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,870
these are these you know these these

00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:45,210
deficiencies these bugs are getting

00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:48,030
discovered and then fixed is it I think

00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:51,030
that really shows the power of the of

00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:53,510
the open source community it is global

00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:57,030
and it's definitely because of the users

00:47:53,510 --> 00:48:02,670
community people are extremely friendly

00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:04,560
and they're always ready to help if you

00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:06,840
go on tire see any day you'll see these

00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,570
guys helping each other out and they're

00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,280
all doing it like in a selfless manner

00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:14,270
the product is transparent for everyone

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:17,460
everyone can look at the code base

00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:19,670
everyone can see how close dark is being

00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:25,200
built nothing nothing is proprietary

00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:27,840
everything is open in many ways it's

00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:32,280
absolutely vital to the the ongoing

00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:36,480
health cloudstack the most exciting

00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:39,300
event in recent memory for me was our

00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,970
first developer boot camp

00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:44,610
and our call gave people a give me two

00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:48,570
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:52,740
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:55,590
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:58,110
chairs in the room twice everything

00:48:55,590 --> 00:49:01,440
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:48:58,110 --> 00:49:04,440
is open source and so I don't think that

00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:06,180
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,210
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,940
computing and so i think it's i think

00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:13,290
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,400
about cloud computing you're really

00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:19,950
talking about open source cloud

00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:22,980
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:25,140
for large deployments you'll have dozens

00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:29,430
of data centers and thousands of servers

00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:32,070
in each data centers these hardware is

00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:35,550
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:38,280
to handle number one that mass scale

00:49:35,550 --> 00:49:41,460
number two it's designed to handle the

00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:44,280
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:48,510
deployments started working on pop stack

00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:51,780
over four years ago and it was the

00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:53,550
original set of people working on it had

00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:57,660
a background of delivering software

00:49:53,550 --> 00:50:01,890
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:05,520
lots of users actually using it high

00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:08,580
availability is a key feature multiple

00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,770
hypervisors support different network

00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:13,770
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,540
better while step management server can

00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:19,230
be deployed in different physical

00:50:15,540 --> 00:50:20,880
machines it definitely has a huge

00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:25,860
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:28,470
there's a major movie studio that they

00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:31,770
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:33,750
to transcode video and i thought that

00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:35,370
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:38,640
more fascinating is what they did during

00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:41,430
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:42,810
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:43,410
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,500
the instance

00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:48,930
and go back to doing real work

00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:50,430
cloudstack is vast it touches so many

00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:52,319
different aspects and there's no one

00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:55,280
person that's kind of like a master of

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:58,770
all those realms I think cloudstack as a

00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,990
project is going to be one of the

00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:05,039
leaders simply because it's some of the

00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:10,470
most feature folan and and robust

00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:13,400
platforms out they were Adam senior

00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:13,400
living through the clouds dag
