the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,540
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,290
southeast linux fest in Clemson South

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,090
Carolina on June 13 2009 for more

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,570
information about the south-east linux

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,609
fest visit southeast linux fest org oh

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,130
great thanks so much for coming out

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:21,689
and especially for coming while you're

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:25,470
at a tech conference to hear a lawyer

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:29,880
talk about copyright law but I think

00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:32,009
it's critically important to get the

00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,290
lawyers and the technologists talking

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:36,980
because left to their own devices the

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:43,050
lawyers are making a pretty bad mess of

00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:45,090
copyright law and here we're a decade

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,100
into the digital millennium as

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:50,539
proclaimed by Congress and announcing

00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:54,379
the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and

00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:56,600
my concern is that the DMCA is

00:00:54,379 --> 00:01:00,930
undermining the architecture of

00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,520
collaboration the internet and open

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,970
source programming have given us

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:10,200
terrific tools for developing technology

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:14,850
to improve our sharing of creative

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:19,770
expression and copyright law is built to

00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:22,560
prop up these old structures and not

00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:27,570
really helping us the ways that it could

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:31,650
be so um a little bit of the legal

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:34,259
policy justifications this was the white

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:37,380
paper of the working group on

00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,630
intellectual property rights 1995 as

00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:42,360
they were first looking at this thing

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,700
the internet and wondering what is it

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,880
and what do we do with it the full

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,890
potential of the national information

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,250
infrastructure as they called it at the

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:55,500
time won't be realized if education

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,600
information and entertainment products

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,030
protected by intellectual property laws

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,020
are not protected effectively when

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:09,270
disseminated via the NII

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:11,879
and the the architects of this vision of

00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,969
internet saw intellectual property

00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:16,859
rights as the key to

00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:18,719
establishing internet communications all

00:02:16,859 --> 00:02:22,139
the computers telephones fax machines

00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,909
etc wires cables networks and satellites

00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:26,909
in the world will not create a

00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,459
successful NII if there is no content

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,189
what will drive the ni is the content

00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:36,889
moving through it and so armed with that

00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:39,629
vision of what internet was they set up

00:02:36,889 --> 00:02:41,489
structures to protect the content they

00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:45,239
recognized than the content they

00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:47,370
recognized as the lobbyists from the big

00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,859
movie studios and music companies were

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:54,540
telling them was the big mass-produced

00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:58,199
big-budget content and the laws reflect

00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:04,019
that and and so the Digital Millennium

00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:05,969
Copyright Act of 1998 has two key

00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,579
sections that I'm going to spend a

00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:11,639
little bit of time talking about section

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:15,569
512 is the Internet service provider

00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:18,419
safe harbor a regime that sets up a safe

00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:22,849
harbor for is penis and also a notice

00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:25,859
and takedown for service providers

00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:30,689
notified of material claim to infringe

00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:34,229
copyright this is a treating the ISPs as

00:03:30,689 --> 00:03:37,229
pressure points where material

00:03:34,229 --> 00:03:42,439
communications can be blocked the other

00:03:37,229 --> 00:03:45,049
big piece is section 1201 the

00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:47,340
anti-circumvention provisions

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:50,209
establishing technical protection

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,099
measures and legal protections for those

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:55,530
technical locks around the same time

00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,629
Congress added another 20 years to

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,199
copyright terms with the Sonny Bono

00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:03,919
copyright term extension act twenty

00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:08,879
years to all existing and future

00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:12,180
copyrights so software produced by a

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,629
company today lasts as work-for-hire

00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,500
lasts for ninety five years under

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:21,209
copyright the works of individual

00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,010
authorship lasts for the life of the

00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:27,180
author Plus 70 years a long time during

00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,449
which we need to ask

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:36,210
for permission or navigate the shoals of

00:04:30,449 --> 00:04:39,120
fair use to use copyrighted material so

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,240
why does all of this matter to us as

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,490
computer programmers and users and

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,930
technology developers and independent

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:52,320
creators because it comes into conflict

00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:55,139
with the Internet as the national

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,729
information infrastructure that NII

00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:02,449
becomes the internet and and we see all

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:07,919
of the technological change that powers

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:10,199
internet development and a bit of a

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,380
collision here so Moore's law tells us

00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:16,050
that processing power

00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:18,810
originally the number of transistors on

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,880
a chip doubles about every 18 months

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,820
computers are getting faster the tools

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,400
that we have on our desktops and in our

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,509
companies are getting faster giving us

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,840
more and more power to develop more and

00:05:30,509 --> 00:05:39,419
more powerful software and tools to

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:42,840
share with one another Metcalfe's law

00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:45,000
tells us that the power of a network

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,190
grows with the square of the number of

00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,500
people connected to it because each of

00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:52,740
us can communicate with every other

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:56,570
person on the network if we want to and

00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:59,520
that produces an exponentially growing

00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:01,860
number of connections some of those

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,889
connections may not be useful to us but

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,729
some of them will be and as Clay Shirky

00:06:04,889 --> 00:06:12,780
suggests we can find latent groups in

00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:18,419
the technology as it becomes easier to

00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:21,229
connect we need to do less to get there

00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:24,590
we can connect via shared hashtag on a

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:27,090
Twitter or identica we can connect via

00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:29,280
around a photograph that one of us has

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,039
posted on a weblog we can find one

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,720
another through open source projects and

00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:36,270
it's easy to throw something out there

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,570
and see what kind of community assembles

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,400
around it so these links are incredibly

00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:45,130
important

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,850
and Wikimedia Commons shows us some of

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,700
the both as operates as a great source

00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:54,100
of graphics to illustrate this and shows

00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,920
the power of who would have thought 10

00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,630
years ago certainly the nii white paper

00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,790
drafters wouldn't have thought that you

00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:02,560
could throw up and encyclopedia anyone

00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:05,020
could edit and would actually get

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,720
something useful out of it but because

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:12,370
it was possible to try it became

00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,620
possible to do and so we see just a

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,310
plethora of services some of these

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:23,320
things may I've gone down some of them

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:27,010
have achieved tremendous power and more

00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:29,740
of them are able to be tried every day

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,950
we've got the disruptive technologies

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,800
the power of new technologies and little

00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:39,330
guys to come up and change the way in

00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:42,820
industry works and so tivo with its

00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:45,430
linux powered operating system inside

00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:52,150
changes the way we experience broadcast

00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:55,120
television and didn't need to ask

00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:58,930
permission from the broadcaster's in

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:02,670
order to to launch that technology was

00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:05,770
able to build its product up before

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,470
challenging and then coming into

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,230
negotiations with some of them none of

00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:14,880
these guys needed to ask permission

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:18,120
because they were building around

00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:23,200
materials that were while copyrighted

00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,940
making lawful non-infringing uses of

00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:29,220
lots of those materials so they were

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:32,349
taking advantage of the Betamax rule

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,650
where the Supreme Court said years ago

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:39,729
that a technology capable of substantial

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:42,370
non-infringing uses wouldn't be deemed

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,760
to contribute to infringement of

00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:48,910
copyright even if some people were

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:52,630
taping movies and in ways that the movie

00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:56,260
studios didn't want that exception

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,780
has led to this range of devices some of

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,690
them open-source some of them not but

00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:07,240
the opportunity for developers to come

00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:11,340
in and work with these things and to

00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:14,200
offer the open source alternatives so I

00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,990
said the links are are threatened the

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,490
links of communication are threatened by

00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:25,540
the pressure on Internet service

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:30,730
providers to police copyrights on behalf

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:35,470
of major copyright owners so the number

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:38,560
of DMCA takedowns is on the rise this is

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:42,100
a chart of just some of the complaints

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,610
that Google received demanding that it

00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:50,470
remove material that has been posted to

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:52,930
its blogger blogs or even is linked from

00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:56,580
the Google search engine people claim to

00:09:52,930 --> 00:10:00,430
Google that by providing a link to a

00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:02,260
page that infringes their copyright that

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,060
Google might be contributing to the

00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:06,790
infringement when someone goes and

00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:08,950
visits that infringing page and thereby

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,810
makes a reproduction in their computer

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:16,210
of the copyrighted material

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:18,940
well since the DMCA safe harbor says

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:22,990
that a service provider won't be held

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:25,650
liable for its users copyright

00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:28,600
infringement if the service provider

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:30,760
responds expeditiously to a notice of

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,930
claimed infringement by removing the

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:37,330
material Google and most other hosting

00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:41,890
companies and search engines respond to

00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:45,700
those notices by removing the complained

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:49,570
of material also a particularly notable

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:53,470
instance of that takedown was during the

00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:57,910
the recent presidential campaign season

00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,320
when candidate McCain had posted to his

00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:02,520
YouTube channel

00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:05,320
a series of his campaign commercials and

00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,980
videos that they had made some of the

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,690
things that he

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,510
included in those videos were his

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:13,330
television appearances candidate goes on

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,180
an interview and says something that he

00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,580
wants to highlight to his supporters he

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:22,330
takes a clip from the television program

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:25,840
and includes it in that video here well

00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:28,030
several television stations and

00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:33,370
including the Christian Broadcasting

00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:36,820
Network and then Fox I believe sent DMCA

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,280
takedown notices to YouTube claiming

00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,320
this is an infringement of our copyright

00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,740
he has copied from our copyrighted

00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,410
television program he along with dozens

00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:51,340
of other people please remove these

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:54,340
clips and YouTube following its standard

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:57,910
DMCA notice and takedown procedure

00:11:54,340 --> 00:12:01,480
removed the clips removed the campaign

00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:04,420
videos and this didn't make the McCain

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:09,640
campaign too happy so they sent a letter

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:11,410
along to YouTube saying we want to alert

00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,930
you to a problem that's chilled this

00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:16,270
free and uninhibited discourse they were

00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,910
appreciating the the power of the

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:21,450
internet to communicate with followers

00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,950
and the democratic discussion or

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:31,660
republican discussion if you will and

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:34,090
and protests did that we need to prevent

00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:36,850
meritless copyright claims from chilling

00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:39,630
political speech asking youtube to

00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,510
please change this rule at least for us

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:45,460
because while the DMCA allows the

00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,410
recipient of a takedown or the target of

00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:50,560
a takedown to file a counter

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:55,000
notification and demand request that the

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:56,650
material will be put back up that the

00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,200
the service provider is only able to

00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:03,070
honor that after waiting 10 to 14

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,530
business days so YouTube could have put

00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,880
this video back up 10 to 14 business

00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:12,160
days later and remain free of copyright

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,470
claims 10 to 14 business days in the

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,780
middle of a political campaign not

00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,750
something the mccain-palin team wanted

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:21,900
to wait so

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,490
they asked for an exception and

00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,550
YouTube's response was thank you very

00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:30,790
much for your concern but no we've got

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:34,500
to treat everybody equally um you can

00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:39,400
avail yourselves of the law if you like

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:44,460
and you can file a 512 F complaint for

00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:47,680
abuse of the DMCA takedown process and

00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:49,330
we also note that you have a little bit

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,450
of political power to change these

00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:54,280
things that the rest of us don't we hope

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,990
that as a Content uploader you've gained

00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:58,120
a sense of some of the challenges we

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,100
face every day and operating YouTube and

00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,770
we look forward to working with Senator

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:07,710
or president McCain on ways to combat

00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:07,710
abuse of the DMCA process in the future

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:15,790
so I haven't seen Senator McCain

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:19,620
proposed the DMCA abusive takedown

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:23,500
Prevention Act yet but we can all

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:25,750
suggest in his office that now that the

00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:29,680
campaign has one down he's got time to

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:40,480
focus on governing again maybe he should

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:42,610
look to this so I don't want to pick on

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Google here because they're also doing

00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:48,000
good things like helping the public at

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,890
least to see the way the law is

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,780
operating they're offering some

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,740
transparency to this notice and takedown

00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:59,950
process by rather than silently removing

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:02,560
links they are showing us where links

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,360
have been removed and letting you click

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,620
through to a page on chilling effects

00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:10,120
where these complaints are documented so

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:16,440
there was a time when if you searched

00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:18,820
for Scientology on the Xenu net critical

00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,760
web page you'd see a whole bunch of

00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,490
pages had been removed but if you wish

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,660
you may read the DMCA complaint for

00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:30,970
these removed results and clicking over

00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:33,790
to chilling effects shows you the

00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:37,690
complaint that has been sent to go

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:41,140
and because the dmca requires that you

00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:43,690
identify with specificity the content

00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:47,100
you want to have removed these

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:51,520
complaints also contain the URLs to the

00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:53,350
pages being complained about and while

00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:56,800
they're not hyperlinks all of you know

00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:59,380
how to use copy and paste and can help

00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,420
to see whether the law is operating as

00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,820
intended are these pages that are being

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,790
removed ripoffs of somebody else's

00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:10,090
copyrighted material or are they pages

00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:12,040
that are critical commentary that use

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:16,450
some quotations from somebody else's

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:18,100
copyrighted work in order to to discuss

00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,890
it the sort of thing that would be

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:23,320
recognized by the copyright law and by a

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:25,420
judge as fair use if it got to that

00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,630
point problem is when you put the

00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:33,250
squeeze on the ISP very few of these

00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:36,450
cases get before a judge because most

00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:37,840
people don't fight it most ISPs don't

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,910
fight it

00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:42,160
many people are uncertain about their

00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:44,470
options and so the chilling effects

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,110
project aims to help people to

00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,330
understand what's happening help people

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,970
to understand their options if they get

00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,600
one of these takedowns and offers some

00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:58,960
resources even to help people file

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:02,830
counter notifications if they if they

00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:05,560
need to other projects in the

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:08,020
transparency game I include MIT as

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,930
YouTube project this is a project of the

00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:15,970
MIT free culture group tracking

00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:20,380
takedowns from YouTube watching what

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:23,110
goes missing out of the popular videos

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:26,230
on YouTube and helping the public to see

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,330
what's happening where are the automated

00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:31,230
content filters taking down something

00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:36,580
that might or might not be infringing

00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:38,410
where is speech being restricted and as

00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:41,170
well where are people just blatantly

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,540
infringing copyright because it's

00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:47,760
certainly not the case that every one of

00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:56,549
these takedowns is abusive

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:59,830
so another place where very recently

00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:04,690
internet service providers and copyright

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:08,010
takedowns are in the news across the

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:11,860
ocean in France the French legislature

00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:14,950
approved the Hadopi three strikes and

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,860
you're out or graduated response law

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:20,309
requiring Internet service providers to

00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,720
listen to complaints from an

00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:26,140
administrative agency basically

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,780
populated by the copyright industries to

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:33,100
say if you get three complaints against

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:36,460
an Internet user that users internet

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:38,500
subscription must be shut off and the

00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:41,500
user has to continue paying Internet

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,970
service fees and can't sign up to get

00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:49,030
Internet service through another

00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:51,760
provider so three strikes a claimed

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:54,340
copyright infringement and you're cut

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,410
off the French internet well just on

00:18:54,340 --> 00:19:00,520
Wednesday the French Constitutional

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:05,350
Court said not so fast internet access

00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:09,370
is key to exercising basic human rights

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:12,850
the court read the French Declaration of

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,440
Rights of Man and citizen to say free

00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:18,570
communication of thoughts and opinions

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:23,950
is one of the most precious rights and

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:27,040
the use of the Internet to engage in

00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:29,590
that free communication is so important

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:33,179
that people can't be cut off without

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:36,880
true judicial process none of this

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:43,000
administrative agency saying no internet

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:45,280
access for you so European Union have

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:50,020
been raising similar concerns in

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:52,929
criticism of the French law so we're

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:57,549
starting to see more pushback against

00:19:52,929 --> 00:20:01,120
this thinking that group property rules

00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:03,970
and anyone who

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,800
is even a suspected infringer might be

00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:13,080
cut off so from the links of

00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:16,720
communication to the locks of

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:22,120
anti-circumvention the other key piece

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:25,540
of the DMCA and as affecting free

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,390
software and communication is the entire

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:32,790
circumvention law which says if you put

00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:36,130
a digital lock on a copyrighted work

00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:41,640
it's an independent violation of the law

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:44,590
to circumvent that lock to break the

00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:48,940
technological measures claimed to

00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:54,550
protect copyright well this is important

00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:58,240
because not only does it apply to media

00:20:54,550 --> 00:21:01,990
music and movies protect covered by DRM

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:05,890
it applies to software programs which

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:08,740
are copyrighted works and can be

00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:10,600
protected by technological measures it

00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:13,270
might apply to the firmware running

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,860
inside your phone if you want to unlock

00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:18,130
your phone to run it on a different

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:22,000
network or to jailbreak it to run your

00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:25,000
own programs on it apple claims that

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,950
that is a circumvention of its

00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,070
technological protection measures

00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:32,410
protecting the software that runs the

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:37,870
phone and that they should have the

00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:39,460
right to stop you from from doing that

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:44,620
from switching it to a different network

00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:52,030
or running your own program coming on it

00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:54,850
and and so you may remember the earliest

00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:59,050
of the litigations around DMCA

00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:01,720
anti-circumvention rules came when 2600

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:09,160
magazine along with some others posted

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:13,230
the DCSS code that was able to decrypt

00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,530
the content scramble system on DVDs and

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,190
the

00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:22,350
2,600 on Emmanuel Goldstein were sued

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:24,940
for trafficking in circumvention tools

00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,100
and forced to remove not only their

00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,039
posting of the code but even the links

00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:32,580
to the code because that might

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:36,100
facilitate people's acquiring these

00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,559
illegal circumvention tools as the court

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:41,700
ruled well what does that do to

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:45,789
circumvention tools like this

00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:49,120
researchers found that when so-called

00:22:45,789 --> 00:22:52,690
copy protected CDs came out some of them

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,880
could be disabled by writing with a

00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,700
marker around the edge of the disc and

00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,510
that would block them from auto running

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:06,760
in your Windows machine if that and

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:09,280
installing secretly some DRN enforcement

00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:11,620
software so now do we have to ban the

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:16,950
sale of sharpies they haven't gone quite

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:23,220
that far but others have tried to use a

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:25,870
DMCA to enforce against interoperability

00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,150
Lexmark claimed that because it's

00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,210
printer toner cartridges had a little

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:33,370
loader program inside that that was a

00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:36,090
copyrighted work that they were entitled

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:38,919
to protect against somebody

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:42,270
manufacturing remanufactured refilled

00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:46,570
cartridges and thankfully the court has

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:48,970
thrown that one out but not because the

00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:51,880
law wasn't intended to cover things like

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,130
this but because Lexmark hadn't

00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,230
implemented it very cleverly they had

00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:59,440
left a way for you to get the program

00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:04,179
without breaking any encryption and

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:07,860
therefore they the lockout code that

00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:10,929
they had was being not an effective

00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:17,940
technological measure because they'd

00:24:10,929 --> 00:24:20,429
left the back door open so this is a

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,440
here's where I want to come to the

00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:27,400
little movie that I was trying to cue up

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:31,290
earlier so every three years

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:36,210
the anti-circumvention law has a

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:40,990
rulemaking procedure built into it where

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:46,650
you can petition the Library of Congress

00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:50,310
and Copyright Office to exempt certain

00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:53,470
circumvention --zz from the law because

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:57,070
you say it's necessary in order to allow

00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:59,070
for non-infringing uses it's not that

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:02,110
we're trying to infringe copyright here

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:06,550
we're just trying to make fair use of

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:08,890
clips of movies or lawfully run programs

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:12,520
on the phone devices that we've

00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:14,860
purchased or test the security of

00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:17,650
computer programs and software that

00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:21,670
we've purchased without fearing that we

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:25,540
would be deemed to circumvent the the

00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:31,210
copyright law and so a few months ago

00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:34,020
the Copyright Office held hearings in

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:38,020
this rulemaking procedure one of the

00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:41,530
petitions for exemption came from a wide

00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:45,100
group of filmmakers and media educators

00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:47,350
and library groups all of whom were

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:50,650
arguing that there are plenty of what

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:54,580
cases where copying something from a DVD

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:57,070
is not an infringement of copyright if

00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,830
i'm a midi educator and i want to queue

00:25:57,070 --> 00:26:03,160
up a string of film clips to show in

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:05,590
class to demonstrate how character is

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,350
developed across a range of filmmaking

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:12,180
techniques that's not an infringement of

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:15,460
the copyright of any of those movies but

00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:17,950
DCSS the copy protection on DVD is

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:21,490
forbids me from doing that unless I

00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,710
stack up a whole bunch of DVDs put them

00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,680
one by one into the player fast-forward

00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:29,890
to the right place and in each one

00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:32,920
technically it would be possible to pull

00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:37,600
clips from the DVD to a harddrive and

00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:40,170
show them in series but the movie

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,380
studios and industries says

00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:48,170
that's a circumvention of technical

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:52,560
measures so a whole bunch of these well

00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:56,130
film educators and lawyers and

00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:58,590
librarians and teachers and documentary

00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,780
filmmakers came to Congress to the

00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:03,230
Library of Congress to explain why it

00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:07,470
was critical that they be able to have

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:11,090
high-quality movies and movie clips to

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:15,350
demonstrate and then the NPA a

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:20,010
representative offered this in response

00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:22,380
no you don't need to circumvent the copy

00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,590
protection you don't need to break CSS

00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:27,870
because you can set up a video recorder

00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:32,610
pointed at your flat-screen television

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:34,410
and capture the video that way and so we

00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:37,040
were treated those of us sitting in the

00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:42,030
Library of Congress were treated to this

00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:51,390
demonstration of how to videotape a

00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:53,540
movie whose sound still doesn't seem to

00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:53,540
work

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:09,010
but anyhow so this is so you set up your

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:12,460
video camera and you then make sure that

00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:17,980
the screen is properly framed connect up

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:19,390
all the pieces together and the end of

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:22,510
the day and several thousand dollars

00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:27,400
later you might have a copy of a movie

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:29,140
that is almost as good but discernibly

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:32,679
different from what you'd get if you

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:35,740
just used a little piece of software on

00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:39,760
your computer to decrypt that very weak

00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:43,540
copy protection scheme but this is the

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,330
movie studios who have fought in states

00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:49,120
across the country for anti camcording

00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,660
laws making it a crime to bring a video

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,980
camera into a movie theater

00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:56,679
demonstrating to all of us that this is

00:28:53,980 --> 00:29:07,179
their preferred way of making a copy of

00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:08,470
a video from DVD yeah and in just a

00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:14,730
moment I think it gets to the final

00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:18,280
picture they're trying to open it up now

00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:20,010
all of this certain Vollmer who works

00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:23,410
with the American Library Association

00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:27,520
was there at the hearing and made this

00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:30,090
video showing and finally we get to

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,090
Harry Potter

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:41,970
so at some point in the next months we

00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:46,570
will hear about that rulemaking and

00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:50,170
whether the librarian and register of

00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:55,960
copyrights have given the public and a

00:29:50,170 --> 00:30:00,850
new three-year exemptions and so whether

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:04,920
we can unlock our phones or as educators

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:08,950
make film clips from movies without

00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:11,650
falling afoul of anti-circumvention we

00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:14,050
still don't have permission to

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:20,430
distribute the tools needed to do those

00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:24,010
acts so it's unclear how they how useful

00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:35,610
those exemptions are for us all even

00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:39,580
when they do come up and and these are

00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:42,610
critical to open source software because

00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:45,850
by standardizing an encryption scheme

00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:49,330
however weak it may be around

00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:51,880
copyrighted media major entertainment

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:55,120
companies are essentially able to say

00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:58,930
sorry you can't interoperate with that

00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,440
with free software you notice that all

00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:06,010
of the DVD players out on the market are

00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:10,240
either Hardware players or proprietary

00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:15,390
software because the copy protection is

00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:17,950
built into the software and it's a

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:20,950
anti-consumer feature there nobody

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:23,290
thinks that the DVD is more valuable

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,660
because of that you can't record it

00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:27,820
button and so if this were free and

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:32,560
open-source software

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:36,190
many people would engineer around that

00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:41,020
restriction comment it out

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:42,670
don't bother checking for it and not

00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,680
because they wanted to infringe

00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:48,029
copyrights but simply because they

00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:50,789
wanted to make full use of the media

00:31:48,029 --> 00:31:53,690
they were given or that they purchased

00:31:50,789 --> 00:31:57,119
and so in order to protect this

00:31:53,690 --> 00:32:03,809
so-called high-value content at the core

00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:07,469
of this copyright production scheme they

00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:10,769
are locking out a whole range of free

00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:12,929
and open development around it if you've

00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:15,869
got a whole media system built around

00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:18,809
free and open source software of course

00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:21,779
you can find DCSS and you can find

00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:24,029
updated versions and any search engine

00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:29,659
knows where to find that and there are

00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:35,729
all sorts of code packages around it but

00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:39,139
you can't easily and lawfully make use

00:32:35,729 --> 00:32:45,379
of that so when a company like

00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:49,679
realnetworks wants to offer a DVD backup

00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:53,549
system or a DVD jukebox they get

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,259
themselves sued by the entertainment

00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:59,429
companies and they're still fighting

00:32:55,259 --> 00:33:03,719
over whether these real technologies

00:32:59,429 --> 00:33:05,999
products violate either the DMCA or the

00:33:03,719 --> 00:33:09,269
contracts and licensing arrangements

00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:16,979
that the entertainment companies have

00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:19,830
set up around around CSS and the

00:33:16,979 --> 00:33:22,879
restrictions that they placed on in

00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:25,979
order to get an authorized license for

00:33:22,879 --> 00:33:28,440
CSS decryption you need to agree that

00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:31,080
your DVD player will not make backup

00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:33,509
copies that it will not allow people to

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,700
change the regions of their players to

00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:39,809
watch DVDs purchased from other parts of

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:44,549
the world that it won't let people step

00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:47,309
over the introductory previews at the

00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:53,539
beginning or the FBI warning none of

00:33:47,309 --> 00:33:59,549
which adds to the viewing experience and

00:33:53,539 --> 00:34:01,960
so these laws are written without a lot

00:33:59,549 --> 00:34:05,650
of thought about

00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,210
the scope of the technology is and the

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:12,460
market and the technological

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:16,869
possibilities whoever was writing DMCA

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:20,470
anti-circumvention didn't probably

00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:22,510
realize that they were cutting off free

00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:24,730
and open development wouldn't have

00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:27,040
realized at the time the power and

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:34,629
potential of free and open development

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:38,589
and it's a uphill battle that goes on in

00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:44,200
each one of these hearings to remind and

00:34:38,589 --> 00:34:47,320
instruct the the Copyright Office and

00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:49,540
Congress about the range of copyright

00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:53,520
related activities that are happening in

00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:57,339
places that they're not looking so MPAA

00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,550
RIAA can hire phalanxes of lobbyists to

00:34:57,339 --> 00:35:02,260
talk about the high value of their

00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:07,720
intellectual property and their

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:10,589
contributions to trade and everybody can

00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,750
recognize their movies and their music

00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:16,630
Congress also needs to be reminded about

00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:20,140
the free and open software that is

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,420
powering the render farms that make some

00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:26,500
of those movies the web servers from

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:28,330
which those things are distributed the

00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,119
operating systems and lots of the

00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:35,250
computers that that make the network

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:40,750
work and need to be reminded courteously

00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:45,730
but correctly about this range of sort

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:51,030
of unnoticed innovation and the ways

00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:55,839
that these laws are having unintended

00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,540
consequences to of restricting that kind

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,030
of independent development so I'll close

00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:06,130
here with one sort of victory

00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:10,180
celebration because as you may know if

00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:13,420
you watch television over rabbit ears we

00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,910
have just concluded our delayed digital

00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,400
television transition

00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:22,380
where we switched from analog to digital

00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,329
broadcasting early on when this

00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:28,710
transition was being proposed the

00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:30,839
entertainment companies went to the

00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:33,059
Federal Communications Commission and

00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:35,520
said we won't make our programming

00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:38,280
available in digital if it's not

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:40,650
protected against copying all of those

00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,349
pirates with their video tapes are going

00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:45,690
to go high-tech and record our beautiful

00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:47,579
digital broadcasts and we'll have no way

00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,530
to stop it we're simply going to

00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:53,280
withhold our programming if you don't

00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:57,720
give us a broadcast flag and the

00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:02,609
broadcast flag the FCC made a rule the

00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:06,150
broadcast flag rule required every

00:37:02,609 --> 00:37:08,309
digital television receiver and

00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,950
demodulator anything capable of

00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:13,680
recognizing a digital television signal

00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:17,010
would have been required to respect and

00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,770
respond to the broadcast flag it had as

00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:22,200
it demodulated and decoded those bits

00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:27,569
watch for the flag if the flag said

00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:30,900
don't copy then it had to refuse to

00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:34,710
output those bits to an over an

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:37,380
unencrypted interface or to anything in

00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:41,299
high resolution say if you get your

00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:44,730
encrypted HDMI but not your

00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:49,890
high-resolution analog or unencrypted

00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:52,740
digital outputs and this would have been

00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:56,309
a technological mandate on every

00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:58,980
manufacturer of Technology when I was at

00:37:56,309 --> 00:38:03,980
EF F we asked would that have applied to

00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:07,319
software new radio devices capable of

00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:10,470
demodulating in software and the FCC

00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:12,599
seemed puzzled by that question but they

00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:17,609
were perfectly willing to mandate for

00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:20,640
Hardware manufactured that it be

00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:22,950
crippled that it forbid its users from

00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,480
doing things like building an

00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,180
open-source DVR so I love my mythtv my

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,309
math TV

00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:33,819
a high-definition television capture

00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:38,559
card and it pulls down that six gigabyte

00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:40,690
an hour stream of digital broadcast and

00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,030
I'm not doing it to infringe copyright

00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:44,530
I'm doing it because if I want to watch

00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,099
television I want to do it on my

00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:49,480
schedule but that would have been

00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:54,220
impossible under the broadcast flag

00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:55,900
regime thankfully American Library

00:38:54,220 --> 00:39:00,609
Association public knowledge

00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:04,839
EFS public interest groups challenged

00:39:00,609 --> 00:39:07,599
the broadcast flag challenged the FCC's

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:09,790
jurisdiction to issue a broadcast flag

00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,760
because saying the FCC has the

00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:17,740
jurisdiction to control broadcasts but

00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:20,980
not receivers and not to impose mandates

00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:24,520
on any manufacturer of receiver

00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:27,940
technology and the DC Circuit Court

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:31,150
agreed so now on digital television

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:34,059
transition flag day any of us who wants

00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:39,059
to can put up a a demodulator and

00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:42,069
capture without a broadcast flag without

00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:45,809
technological restriction the digital

00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:45,809
broadcasts that are coming over the air

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:57,520
so so there we've won and one

00:39:54,089 --> 00:40:03,549
possibilities to continue developing

00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:07,990
freely in this area and so we don't know

00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:11,920
what we're we're not legislating for one

00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:13,690
particular vision of innovation it's

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:16,440
that we want to leave room for the

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:19,720
unexpected who would have thought that

00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,240
cats with funny grammar would become a

00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,369
huge internet phenomenon who would have

00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:29,190
thought that the TiVo the iPod the

00:40:24,369 --> 00:40:33,569
iPhone the the Linux server and desktop

00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:38,530
would have become what they were because

00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:41,200
we had unrestricted access in lots of

00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,950
places we've been able to develop those

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,380
things

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:50,920
and so my message to to those of you who

00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:53,950
are developers keep developing those of

00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,280
you who are users keep on helping us to

00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:59,920
demonstrate the value the range of

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,940
creativity that's not infringing

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,530
copyright but that is engaging with

00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:09,010
copyrighted material that is developing

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:13,119
your own copyrighted material and the

00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:17,440
way is that the law needs to support

00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,710
that through tools like free software

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,660
licenses and GPL and Creative Commons

00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:29,109
for non software works and to help us

00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:32,410
with exhibits in the fight against laws

00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:37,390
that are restricting our activities in

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:39,599
other areas so thanks and I'm happy to

00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,599
take questions

00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:09,130
well it only makes sense if you think

00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,670
about this sort of interlocking scheme

00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:16,930
of we've got a technological protection

00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:19,120
measure around our DVDs and so we

00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:21,400
require that nobody anywhere in the

00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:24,750
chain be able to get access to the

00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:30,570
unencrypted stream of bits from that DVD

00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:33,070
if you put it into a Linux system you

00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:35,170
might see what was being sent to the

00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:38,470
video card and you might take those bits

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:40,510
and do something awful with them worse

00:42:38,470 --> 00:43:04,930
even than pointing a video camera at the

00:42:40,510 --> 00:43:06,400
television yeah over here well the

00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:08,410
questions of would you be infringing

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,950
copyright and could you get a takedown

00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:15,730
notice or of course different so

00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:18,460
copyright permits you to quote as much

00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:21,490
as is necessary to make commentary and

00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,690
criticism of somebody else's work and so

00:43:21,490 --> 00:43:25,300
if you're engaging in a conversation

00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:27,790
with somebody else's blog post and that

00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:31,000
includes taking some quotes and citing

00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:34,720
them and explaining what you disagree

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:37,570
with or agree with that doesn't sound

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,110
like an infringement of copyright if

00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:43,150
somebody filed a DMCA takedown notice

00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:46,960
then that would be an opportunity to

00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:49,030
invoke section 512 F and file a

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,200
complaint for misuse of the DMCA

00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,200
takedown process

00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:36,330
well now you're coming into the conflict

00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:39,030
between copyright and contracts and

00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:41,100
end-user license agreements so in there

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:45,120
EULA they can say all sorts of things

00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:51,020
that aren't limited by the the fair use

00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:56,210
exceptions to copyright and it's not ooh

00:44:51,020 --> 00:45:00,630
some people I think it was one of the

00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:02,850
antivirus vendors got Network associates

00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:04,770
was sued by the state of New York for

00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:07,850
having overreaching language like that

00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:11,040
in its end user License Agreement

00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:12,660
and I could have a lot of people on your

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,700
side if you wanted to run those

00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:18,180
benchmarks and then got a lawsuit from

00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:23,280
Microsoft claiming infringement or

00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:24,780
breach of contract there so sometimes

00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,980
people are just doing those things to

00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:31,920
try to scare users even if they don't

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:36,120
expect to be to file a lawsuit and

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,620
follow up but if you if you and that's

00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:40,070
the sort of thing that e FF is very

00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,570
interested in so if you've got a a

00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:45,630
technical report that you'd like to do

00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:49,170
and feel that you're being stopped by

00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:52,800
ridiculous licensing terms send a note

00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:56,870
to F F and explain the problem and and

00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,870
see if it makes a good test case

00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,450
well sometimes the the state attorney

00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:29,020
general or Federal Trade Commission

00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:36,070
could go after them for unfair consumer

00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:38,350
practices or or a court could declare

00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:42,630
that because that is unconscionable the

00:46:38,350 --> 00:46:42,630
whole contract should be unenforceable

00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:59,200
it doesn't mean it is strong and

00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:02,920
resistant to use or attack it only means

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:05,920
has the effect of is the definition

00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,430
given in the statute so if by its nature

00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,870
it has the effect of requiring you to

00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:12,870
decrypt or get authorization

00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:55,090
would be protection yes and so the best

00:47:50,140 --> 00:48:00,430
example of that is some early versions

00:47:55,090 --> 00:48:02,740
of Adobe's PDF software had some

00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:05,740
technical controls but they didn't do

00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:10,390
anything to enforce that and if you took

00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:14,170
X PDF you could decrypt their so-called

00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:16,450
do not print PDFs but so it's the

00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,910
combination of law and licensing that

00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:23,050
the movie studios say if you want a

00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:26,859
license to decrypt CSS you need to

00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:29,230
implement it robustly and robustness

00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:31,930
against user modification includes

00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:34,480
something that can't be decompiled or

00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:38,099
changed with a jumper or a few comments

00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:41,500
in source code and so they've said

00:48:38,099 --> 00:48:44,380
essentially that they don't believe that

00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:47,760
any open-source implementation would be

00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,760
compatible with their license

00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:59,150
yes I haven't seen it but it it could

00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,830
happen I'm happy to take questions

00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,840
afterwards but I'm being told that I

00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:07,520
need to to stop for now thanks a lot
