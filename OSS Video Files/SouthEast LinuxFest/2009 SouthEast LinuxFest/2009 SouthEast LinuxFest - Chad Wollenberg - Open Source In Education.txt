the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,359
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,740
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,049
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,789
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,080
southeast linux fest org thank you i

00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:20,250
appreciate your clapping because i'm

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,720
sure you're not going to be clapping in

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:23,880
but i appreciate you all coming this

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,710
allows some fantastic turnout it's a

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:27,000
open source education is what i'm going

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,010
to talk about and I you know I do this

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,119
funny little tagline you know our

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,890
children have butterflies in their

00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,750
brains a tendency you know if you're

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,910
right if you live in America and you've

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,610
been educated chances are you use

00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,149
windows or Macs in the education system

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,620
and it's been very hard to you know get

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:44,879
the adoption of open source and

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:51,180
education i'm going to talk that you

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:52,710
about that it's the way we go now i keep

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,800
in mind i am a network engineer really

00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:59,399
bad with slides I apologize bad speller

00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,910
yeah I I apologized at Davis apologizes

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,700
to I don't know if he's feelin alright

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:08,280
when did the community get taken out of

00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:09,930
education the you know it does take a

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,070
village to raise a child that's an old

00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,640
adage I believe it's actually from the

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,970
Bible and at some point we kind of

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,159
became disconnected with our local

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:23,670
education you know I'm sure many of you

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,610
have kids in school systems but we're

00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,240
not as involved as we used to be you

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:33,150
know and it's kind of a shame and it

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,890
it's you know if we all sit back and do

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,659
nothing nothing's going to change

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:40,500
because the fact of the matter is right

00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:42,450
now it's it's in pretty bad shape and we

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,649
really need to know we are at where the

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,040
community we're all community oriented

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:49,560
people that's why we're here right so

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,990
just think about this I'm not they just

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,399
think about that this is where I live by

00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:59,040
the way it's a view yeah it's nice I

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,189
don't know it's Wikimedia is to Creative

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,750
Commons soon but yeah so so just keep

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:08,489
this in mind as we as we progress

00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:11,030
through me open source and education go

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:13,480
hand in hand any any Linux users here

00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,239
yeah they're capable right

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,890
you know what rated Linux start and why

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,299
did it start right it wasn't an

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,530
educational institution some of my

00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:21,819
favorite but now obviously all these

00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:23,379
projects did not start an educational

00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:25,060
institutions with something did one of

00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:26,440
my favorites Drupal met heard of it so

00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,920
you know web content management system

00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,700
started out of college or a university i

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,239
should say now moodle actually started

00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:39,579
by k-12 educators it's a course

00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,410
management system used in k-12 education

00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:42,250
which i'm going to talk a lot i work for

00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,680
a community college but i've only been

00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,959
there for two weeks I was in k-12

00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,120
education for five years that's network

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,220
manager so a lot I'm gonna talk a lot

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,810
about k12 and what's going on there and

00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,660
and in the dire shape and all you're

00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:59,620
going to go out charge and yeah okay all

00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:01,870
right but yeah so you know it really we

00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,579
should see more open source and

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,870
education why don't we I mean when

00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:07,060
you're if you go to college for

00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,500
engineering many engineering schools

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:13,810
require you to run windows on your

00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:17,019
system what why why is that why are we

00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,849
so entrenched in this culture that at a

00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:21,130
school that promotes engineering would

00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:23,019
not want you to run linux on your system

00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:26,709
i'm not sure what we'll talk about it

00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:31,840
though in case you weren't paying

00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:33,310
attention the economy done broke anybody

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,200
anyway listen to the news lately it's a

00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,269
little scary little scary i almost

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,609
couldn't afford gas to come here right

00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:41,620
this is a really cool picture this was a

00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:44,169
protest in new york city about

00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,180
unemployment protest so that these

00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:47,440
people aren't actually an in line to get

00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,959
a job as a protest against unemployment

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,109
several years back but pretty picture

00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:55,269
but you know open source and education

00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,669
and this is a big part of it really is

00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:01,180
about fiscal responsibility i live in

00:03:57,669 --> 00:04:03,940
the second poorest County in virginia we

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:07,329
have thirty percent people of the people

00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,129
live in poverty I mean when I say

00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,680
poverty we still have dirt floors and

00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,449
houses and we still have no plumbing in

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,910
some houses did you realize this even

00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:20,049
goes on in the United States it's true

00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:22,960
and meanwhile you know we're requiring

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:24,039
these kids to buy licenses for her

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,360
office so they can do their homework

00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:26,880
i'll talk about in a few minutes here

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,390
but also

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,320
the school system is willing to pay

00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:33,090
extraordinary amounts of money on

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,020
proprietary software when there are free

00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:40,230
and open alternatives and it's crazy we

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,680
you know we almost lost 80 teachers this

00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:47,760
year because of financial problems it's

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,020
serious and you know I of course free

00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,030
and open software isn't all about the

00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:52,770
financial factor but it's pretty big

00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,930
when you're talking about firing 80

00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,550
teachers maybe we can save that money

00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,190
somewhere with free and open source

00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:03,780
lover or at least think about it at

00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:06,480
least consider it right all right but it

00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:08,460
is about social responsibility all right

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:11,910
johnie's family couldn't afford dinner

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:14,040
tonight has Johnny's mom had to buy

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,660
office 2007 so he could do his homework

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,790
funny but true and scary why should

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,160
Johnny have to buy a license when

00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,820
there's free and open alternatives to do

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,750
his homework insane to me I'm going to

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,430
talk about some of the initiatives that

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:34,320
I've done in k-12 and the money that

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:36,810
we've saved but in reality this this is

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,610
about social responsibility why would

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,620
the government a government entity any

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:42,060
government entity require students to

00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:43,230
purchase license from a proprietary

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:48,120
company when there's free and open

00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:49,680
alternatives insane just saying and then

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,770
there's the other social responsibility

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,670
aspect do you want your kids graduating

00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:57,720
from college or k12 with the concept

00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,120
that the only thing in the world is

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,800
Microsoft there are alternatives out

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,750
there choice is a wonderful thing at

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,000
least let them know what it is if they

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,650
still run Microsoft fine but wouldn't i

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,270
mean i think we all we don't need

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:10,710
everyone running linux or maybe you do

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,470
want that but i think we can all agree

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:16,140
that we want people to know linux exists

00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,000
because right now if you stop someone on

00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,480
the street and you say hey I'm a linux

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,850
user they're like what the heck is that

00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:29,730
yeah they have no idea okay that's true

00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:32,070
yeah the truth is out there you just

00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:36,210
have to look entire governments are

00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:38,850
moving to open source slowly but surely

00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:40,080
Brazil's huge I mean huge I think you

00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:42,750
probably all know this

00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,750
I'm preaching the choir here na but

00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:50,310
Brazil China's got their red flag linux

00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:52,469
very appropriately scarily named india

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,280
is moving towards open source russia now

00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:56,129
there's been some really good

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,479
initiatives in Germany France has their

00:06:56,129 --> 00:07:00,180
impact entire police force now I think

00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,710
using Linux yeah and the government

00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,620
relação the French government has

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,379
fantastic Spain education system runs

00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:11,580
linux some initiatives in off here but I

00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:14,909
want you to look at the top half of this

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,849
list and see young a little bit back to

00:07:14,909 --> 00:07:20,099
fiscal responsibility you definitely see

00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:21,569
some developing nations there and there

00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:23,810
are many many more developing nations

00:07:21,569 --> 00:07:26,669
that are using open source software why

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,469
right seems pretty obvious does doesn't

00:07:26,669 --> 00:07:32,219
it if only it were obvious to our

00:07:28,469 --> 00:07:37,129
legislators right so yeah where is the

00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:39,960
US where is the US where is the u.s.

00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:42,870
there certainly on this the truth is out

00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,610
there list the truth is that the

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:50,310
adoption of open source is horrible here

00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:53,520
you know you well let's see what's next

00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:56,310
oh wait that's the positive slide but I

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,919
just want to say think about your local

00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,080
area do they run linux do they run open

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:02,669
source software in government entities

00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,240
or in your schools is there anyone here

00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,729
that has linux in the school's locally

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,349
fantastic that's awesome what about so

00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:11,610
there are three hands right it was huge

00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:14,219
room for the people from all over the

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:15,690
place in there with your hands how about

00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:18,060
just open source in general do you know

00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:21,089
a few school systems or local colleges

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,069
run open source at all and another some

00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:26,370
more hands right which is interesting

00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:28,409
there is steps you have to take to get

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,969
these things into schools and it's not

00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:32,490
about just throwing linux on that next

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:34,469
up i'll talk about that but let's talk a

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,269
little positive about it some states

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:39,539
have gone ahead and made you know

00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:41,760
relatively large initiatives to moving

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,430
towards open source and pretty much

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,490
failed miserably no but but there you

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:51,630
know it's it's been hard California's

00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:53,550
got some really cool when X terminal

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,880
service project initiatives going on

00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,310
where they're

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,570
you know using thin clients at servant

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,390
server client architecture and running a

00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:02,270
boon to in labs cutting down on price

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,610
for students all right fantastic

00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:07,020
Massachusetts awesome they tried to you

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:08,940
know try to implement ODF in the

00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,130
government but which was an absolute

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,110
disaster but but thank you for at least

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,970
blazing the trail for us so it's a

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:18,390
little bit easier to discuss for the

00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:21,000
government now also a Massachusetts MIT

00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:23,520
right they have their OpenCourseWare

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,260
which is awesome if anyone if you have

00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,750
not checked out MIT OpenCourseWare

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:28,740
basically everything MIT is online and

00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,660
if you don't want a degree or anything

00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:32,850
you go there you learn whatever you want

00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:34,620
my learn physics awesome right just go

00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,780
there download the download stuff and

00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,920
watch it now that's in the nature of

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,240
open source obviously we're getting the

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,320
license and creative commons and stuff

00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,320
but still that's that's an awesome

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:47,010
awesome initiative from MIT right New

00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,740
York has some very interesting new law

00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:53,640
that's just gone in it's a procurement

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,000
law so now when you procure a software

00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,860
or hardware in New York you have to

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,270
include open standards in the

00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:05,790
procurement just really cool because

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:08,340
what that means is basically proprietary

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,110
companies have to abide by open

00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,850
standards through procurement laws in

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,650
New York State now very interesting what

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,250
it do it really a step in the right

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,900
direction um Virginia yeah that's where

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,570
I'm from so I'll talk about that a

00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,910
little bit and Indiana has some great

00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:25,440
great initiatives in their school's

00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,720
their they're actually really shining

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,980
star uh but as far as a lot of open

00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,190
source adoption the josh star josh sorry

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,350
so I I volunteer my time once a year I

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,020
go to the high schools and I talked to

00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,060
the seniors and I talk to them about

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,130
linux and it's awesome about advanced

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,650
computing and I tell them about the real

00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:49,680
world and that Microsoft is not the end

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,630
all be all really cool kids love it

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,190
right because right there the problem in

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,980
this whole scenario certainly is not

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,660
with the kids right kids adapt they

00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,430
change they don't care man the

00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,420
technology they can use you put it in

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,670
front of them they're ready to rock and

00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:05,220
roll right so really I get really good

00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:07,020
reception up by the students well I just

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,769
same job two weeks ago started at a new

00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,480
job

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:11,459
first thing out of my mouth when I walk

00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,559
in the door is so who's running Linux

00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:15,689
the huge Community College system's nine

00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,279
locations we've got you know thousands

00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:21,509
of students and stuff who's running

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:23,850
Linux I say one guy Hey oh really one

00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:26,670
guy runs lougle is it yeah okay what's

00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,319
what's the thing Josh like all right off

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,879
the l to me Josh he's in my department

00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:32,069
ice cream one of my employees so I go

00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:34,709
down there and sure enough it was one of

00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:37,860
these students that I had talked to

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:39,959
three years ago and he would and he got

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,600
a as soon as i was done to him he's

00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:44,939
chad and he's like I want to thank you

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,410
and he got into the goon to his booty

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:49,049
logo team he's been helping others

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,660
online guy is hardcore now I was like

00:11:49,049 --> 00:11:53,639
yes you know success even if it's just

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,769
that one kid if I got something out of

00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,049
it you know it was just awesome so it

00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,850
does make a difference you know talk to

00:11:58,049 --> 00:12:01,559
the young people and tell them what's

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,790
out there like I said they don't have to

00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:08,699
use it but at least they know there's a

00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:11,910
choice right cool yeah this I mean this

00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:13,350
is an education as with anywhere else in

00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,249
business world in this world we can

00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,709
force you to you're getting paid right

00:12:14,249 --> 00:12:18,420
of course you're going to change or

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:22,709
you're getting fired education is not

00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:24,269
like that easy no you know a really hard

00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:25,439
to a lot of a lot of features have

00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:26,459
really hard time to change a lot of

00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:29,939
administrators have a really hard time

00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:34,799
of change education is slow things do

00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:36,480
not change fast so and that's with

00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,029
anything that's not just with open

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,220
source right that's with anything so the

00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:43,949
real problem here and really the real

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:47,699
problem is how can we better a DAB adopt

00:12:43,949 --> 00:12:48,749
change and that is the hardest notice

00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:50,100
I'm going to be raising lots of

00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:51,660
questions maybe not giving the answers

00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:54,089
well I'll try to give you some we're

00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,410
getting there right and if there's any

00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:58,559
questions that I need time feel free to

00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:01,199
holler especially since I'm flying

00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,829
through these slides and I'll take

00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:10,290
questions at the end the answer for me

00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:13,019
is success via small steps okay I did

00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:16,519
not take over the manager of IQs ition

00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:20,100
in the k-12 district and say stop

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:21,420
everyone must use a boon to now because

00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,700
like yeah I would a lot

00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:28,380
job right but really the the answer was

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,150
yeah talk talking about us you know what

00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,490
open source is now hidden node open

00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,740
source says director of technology right

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:39,240
great guy he now runs a boomkin by the

00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,920
way that was five years ago yeah well

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:44,010
Lee here's what open source is do you

00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:47,280
use firefox yeah he's far that's open

00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,870
source of a sudden oh and see this is

00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,400
why firefox is so cool because it's

00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,660
community oriented and where's the

00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,270
security patch you get it immediately

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,980
because yay open source right and so

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:58,740
then all of a sudden he starts getting

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,620
it and then all of a sudden Oh have you

00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,150
tried openoffice well check this out you

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,000
can you can still you know export it to

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,700
a doc file he's still gonna use it and

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,270
he starts liking that there's very small

00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,740
steps I did not say you know I did not

00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,650
wave you know I did not say we need to

00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,570
open run opennms now and you know you

00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:22,830
will change to the open we will we will

00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:26,490
lead the way anyway small steps moodle

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:30,270
k-12 education fantastic project course

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,440
management system if if your local

00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:34,920
school system is not doing online

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,270
courses they should be because when kids

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,920
go to college do you don't have what the

00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,150
percentage of kids you could take an

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,670
online course throughout their career

00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:43,860
now it's something it's like ninety-five

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,300
percent of students do now so if you go

00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,770
to college you are going to be taking at

00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:51,950
least one of your courses online at some

00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:53,880
point yet in high school nobody right

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:56,580
they should be using Moodle course

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,790
management system developed by K through

00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:03,240
12 people for K through 12 fantastic in

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:05,550
the high read their Sakai sakai directly

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,810
competes with blackboard it's evolved by

00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:13,230
colleges very cool stuff obviously open

00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:14,880
office this this is 1 i'm going to talk

00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,770
about quite a bit in just a second here

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,620
firefox already mentioned i've already

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,000
mentioned linux terminal service project

00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:23,520
other cool things that you can use you

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,960
know we didn't see a lot to get in the

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,670
machines and change around when people

00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:32,130
didn't know and scare him you know move

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:34,310
the mouse telugu all right so but you

00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:36,350
know i was there for five years

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:38,240
you can just quickly add up that math

00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:42,170
actually did most of those changes in

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,720
three years this is the big one I got a

00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,090
lot of attention for this one removed

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,120
the entire district over the open office

00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,980
and Google Apps combination of both

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,320
completely got rid of Microsoft save two

00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,790
hundred thousand dollars doing it's a

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,700
medium-sized district we only have five

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,430
thousand students told locations 2000

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,980
meters right so let's think about that

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,930
if you're in a city area you can you

00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,650
imagine how much money you could save

00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,390
just by getting away from office insane

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:16,130
amounts of money teachers are losing

00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:18,830
their jobs right small steps to that's

00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,870
not a huge now it was hard don't get me

00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:23,600
wrong i mean my boss I mean they had

00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,310
pitch it up pitchforks and torches on

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,200
his door so we live in a small town man

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,620
everybody knows everybody it was a tough

00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,420
transition but we lived you know that

00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:33,710
was back in September it's the end of

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:36,650
the year now people talk about it

00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,330
anymore the beginning it was hard change

00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:39,800
is hard but she get through it everybody

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,450
forgets about it students didn't care

00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,940
back some students were like awesome I

00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:45,670
use at home not to mention we were then

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,500
able to give you know the open disc

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:50,570
doubled up the open descamps goes back

00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,580
to social responsibility I can I can

00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,230
leave those at the office if a student

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:55,670
does not have microsoft office at home

00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:58,160
you go the office can i please have one

00:16:55,670 --> 00:17:00,800
of those discs take it take it home now

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:07,400
he can do is homework right fan-tastic

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:09,380
uh later after UMass plans me about this

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,970
stuff i replaced all the websites with

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:13,189
drupal saved about twenty thousand

00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:15,380
dollars yes it really does cost that

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:17,839
much just for a school system to go with

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,900
a proprietary says have a contractor

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,730
come in do the website and we have way

00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,230
more functionality at a drupal i mean i

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,079
could do a whole hour session on drupal

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:28,790
you don't want me get that i can fog

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:30,890
free and open ghosts the cloning system

00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:32,810
yeah we completely got rid of symantec

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,880
ghost or acronis there's another another

00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:36,730
ghost system use that that is a

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:40,190
fantastic product they just had their

00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:42,470
1000th install and I was like wow really

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,050
because it is such a cool project if

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,700
you're if you're in a huge business or

00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,020
education environment you need to look

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,070
in the fog and

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,570
virtualization was actually a

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,550
combination of free and open-source we

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,320
did use VMware but we also used openvz

00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:56,600
which is really cool virtualization

00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,370
colonel style if anybody wants to talk

00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:02,510
geek later I'll be happy to talk to you

00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:04,940
but I did with that stuff on top of

00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:08,600
streamlining IT you know I had four

00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:11,210
people and we managed what like I said

00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,840
you know to / / it's about actual about

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,920
2400 computers at 12 locations yeah open

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,390
source is great for stream right the

00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,280
streamlining I t-giving your people some

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,440
time to do innovative stuff and right

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,940
now guaranteed at your local school

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,470
district I got a bunch of people running

00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,910
around like chickens with their head cut

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,120
off they're getting paid twenty three

00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:31,610
thousand dollars a year travesti is what

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,570
it is very hard to implement to open

00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,680
source software when you're running

00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:37,250
around like a chicken with your head cut

00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:39,470
off right right any questions on any

00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:48,800
other stuff this is the beef right here

00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:54,500
is it me okay maybe it spoiled me how to

00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:57,020
get involved so so many ways it's very

00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,370
important to keep in mind here well I

00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,440
think it's my next slide so I don't to

00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,810
have myself there are many many ways to

00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,240
get involved and most of you are

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:07,640
probably members of linux user groups

00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,750
very very great way to you know get get

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,990
everyone involved in your linux user

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:14,450
group and go to the school you know once

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,610
a year just start once a year and hold

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,560
an open source you know fest where kids

00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:20,720
can ask questions or you know just like

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,630
a forum or whatever now great great way

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:28,430
to get started school boards i'll talk

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:30,350
about community events you know the

00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:32,240

booth and have cds there you guys are

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,140
any other stuff you're smart about this

00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,750
done computer clubs it doesn't have to

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,910
be a linux club start you know if

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,860
volunteers some of your time start a

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,900
computer club at the high school and get

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,090
get involved it's not just about linux

00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,910

networking care and you know teaching

00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:56,390
windows and mac OS to they should know

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:00,980
everything it's not it's not about being

00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,909
you know we like choice right um

00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,159
educational conference is a great place

00:20:02,909 --> 00:20:07,650

00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,059
go I mean every state has them and you

00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,260
could actually set up a booth there and

00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:12,330
you can actually talk directly to

00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,720
teachers and get involved that way and

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,880
you know change their mindset software

00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,630

was a room full of female financial

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,970
directors for school systems and it was

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:39,809
an interesting I had a ball you can

00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,950
listen to it I put it up his podcast but

00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,770
it ended up being one of the most

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:46,260
productive half our presentations that

00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:48,150
I've ever done because I started saying

00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,610
look at the money I save ladies and they

00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:51,990
were like oh yeah look at that like

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,970
maybe we shouldn't talking to our IT

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:57,110

everybody down again sorry um yeah so

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,520
software user groups could actually

00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,990
really good spot find out if there's

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,669
like you know an Oracle group in the

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:10,140
area just go talk to him hey you ever

they're not going to listen to you if

00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,010
you walk in there holding up a penguin

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,720
and screaming about linux it's just not

00:22:53,010 --> 00:23:03,630
going to happen right because they have

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:04,740
no idea because it is the I have no idea

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:07,650
what the hell you're talking about

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:09,059
factor at a school board meeting I

00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:11,880
assure you unless you were very

00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:14,840
fortunate you're your school boy doesn't

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:18,299
have a clue open source software what

00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:20,630
yeah in my area see now now keep in mind

00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,460
here this wasn't actually a mistake I

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,350
tried to find a picture of a farmer not

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,179
that I'm not sparing farmers the great

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,799
peep I mean and there's plenty of

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:30,929
tech-savvy farmers we have a couple here

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,460
it's fantastic but i'll tell you the

00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:36,630
story about my school board just a

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:38,190
second I couldn't find a picture uh 33

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,169
years ago I had to go my first school

00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:46,620
board meeting and it went something like

00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:49,110
this um mr. Wallenberg oh yes are you

00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:52,080

this is my response ah

00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:14,979
John Deere tractor a very very hard

00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:17,710
group that I had to deal with first

00:24:14,979 --> 00:24:20,200
several years to I get some of it and

00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,509
every single single thing i did i had to

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,450
get doing this group of guys love them i

00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:28,779
assure you i say total jest but that did

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:29,710
happen to me and there is the i have no

00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:31,059
idea what the hell you're talking about

00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:32,950
factor if you go in there and start

00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:34,179
making jokes about yeah well I see what

00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:38,580
you're saying but I already said that

00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:38,580
the dev know they're not going to get it

00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:44,919
right not a good idea got to take it

00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:47,019
down make sure the guy you sent can also

00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:52,859
take it down to the level right it's

00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:57,039
important how am i doing the time where

00:24:52,859 --> 00:25:00,399
yeah once you fast that's alright we're

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:04,239
back to this it takes a village to raise

00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:06,099
a child now you are all members of a

00:25:04,239 --> 00:25:09,519
wonderful community is called the Linux

00:25:06,099 --> 00:25:11,229
community and i love it you love it it's

00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,340
mainly an online community every once in

00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:14,320
a while these weird people get together

00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,720
at Clemson University or other areas in

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,359
the country but you know mainly we're an

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,549
online community but you also live in a

00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:22,659
real community believe it or not so even

00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:26,049
though that you might be in the basement

00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:31,359
all the time like me and that community

00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:34,029
needs help you know Microsoft has deeply

00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:37,029
entrenched itself as the only player in

00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:42,249
town when it comes to federal state and

00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:43,840
local government and I ask you this you

00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:45,429
may be a plumber you may be a truck

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,460
driver you may be a network manager

00:25:45,429 --> 00:25:50,639
whoever you are that's not the only role

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:54,840
that you can play in your community and

00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:57,519
you know I say this try or just or

00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,619
become proactive in some way it doesn't

00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,830
have to be going to school boards but

00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:05,019
find out who to talk to there's someone

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,389
receptive in your area to this stuff you

00:26:05,019 --> 00:26:09,580
just have to figure out who and you just

00:26:07,389 --> 00:26:10,960
have to go talk to them I ask you what

00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:13,919
role you play in your local community

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,890
and whether or not you could step it up

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:21,580
and it's it's so important

00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:24,340
I sped through all of that is there any

00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:53,800
questions for me whatsoever please just

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:56,890
hit me guy yes sir right yeah it's a big

00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,270
fat it depends it depends on is your

00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:00,430
local school board receptive to these

00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:02,050
kinds of things and you should know by

00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:04,480
you know find out find out if you don't

00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,940
know go to a meeting just hang on the

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,860
back right so it's all public for them i

00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:11,320
would say that there are some very very

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:13,840
very good school boards there are very

00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:16,030
good words on university levels that

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:19,060
will be receptive to this in my

00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:20,800
experience more than that that they are

00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:22,990
not receptive to this type of thing

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,430
mainly because their internal

00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,800
departments are supposed to be making

00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:30,010
the decisions if that is the case it

00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:32,800
probably is better to seek out someone

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:34,330
with affinity that maybe not the IT guy

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,640
maybe maybe a science teacher I don't

00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,860
know if he's in here thats yeah man

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,600
maybe a science teacher that knows a lot

00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,190
about open source you kind of have to

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:45,130
seek out that person and make them

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:48,150
proactive within but like the and and

00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,150
that's important yes sir

00:27:53,500 --> 00:28:04,340
realizes it has it is it is quite

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,210
inexpensive on the okay so you want to

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,559
know where I got that two thousand

00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,850
dollars when we got rid of the office i

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,250
could tell you i give you the math in

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:11,960
fact i can i can if you email me which

00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:15,259
here's moment information i can actually

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:17,360
give you the sheet the the numbers two

00:28:15,259 --> 00:28:18,590
thousand licenses you neither go by the

00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,600
number of users by the number of

00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:22,070
computers the lower of the two we had

00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,110
about two thousand computers we needed

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,899
to get we were at a point where we had

00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:29,090
to upgrade to office 2007 I licensure on

00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:31,399
now there is a greatly reduced price if

00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:32,779
you go and try to buy office 2007 and

00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:34,580
you're not part of an educationalist was

00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:36,379
it these days like 90 bucks hundred

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:42,470
bucks I don't want outrageous I don't

00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:43,669
know for you it's 150 for us because we

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,220
were in an academic alliance and we're

00:28:43,669 --> 00:28:48,769
k12 it's actually reduced more and it

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,870
was about fifty dollars per license do

00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:52,580
the quick math right there two thousand

00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,409
puters fifty dollars per license still

00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:58,220
ton of money and we're a small district

00:28:54,409 --> 00:29:00,470
so uh yes they Micah's I mean that is

00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:02,059
the thing right Microsoft's good then

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:04,009
they reduce all the prices don't worry

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:06,379
you can run our software it's fine hey

00:29:04,009 --> 00:29:10,100
we'll also give your kids certifications

00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:12,529
in our software to very important what's

00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:13,669
that okay right you get that's exactly

00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:15,710
right you get the first one for free

00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:20,169
it's they then they hook yeah yeah and

00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:20,169
it's been that way for 20 years

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,240
right which is total bollocks at this

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,790
point you guys understand this right

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:34,900
because it's not about teaching a

00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:36,670
student microsoft office 2007 it's about

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:38,620
teaching student how to use an office

00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,240
suite there are underlying things you

00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,030
can teach a student without using

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,250
Microsoft and not only that but guess

00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:47,470
what every day two thousand businesses

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:50,230
sign up for google apps yeah I don't

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:54,100
know we'll see what happens but I got a

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:57,640
feeling open off excuse me office at the

00:29:54,100 --> 00:30:05,290
suite that is Microsoft Office is dying

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:08,560
a slow death I could be wrong amen

00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:11,080
brother that's a fantastic point the

00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:13,330
kids in you know in kindergarten to

00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:15,910
eighth grade by the time they get to

00:30:13,330 --> 00:30:17,200
college six years has passed I don't

00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:19,030
think anyone in here knows what's going

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,220
to be going on in six years from now in

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,220
technology because it's crazy yeah ah

00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,400
you bring up the big question notice I

00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,160
didn't put linux on my list of things

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:42,850
that I implemented right small steps

00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:44,710
bias oh my goal was to actually move as

00:30:42,850 --> 00:30:46,390
much as i could to open source so when

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,220
the day came that the underlying

00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,680
operating system actually did become

00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,690
agnostic we could then move to linux

00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,670
unfortunately in virginia too many

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:56,860
applications run by the state passed

00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:02,340
down and how we get our money require

00:30:56,860 --> 00:31:02,340
windows and mac OS 10 yeah

00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:51,429
principles principles great great allies

00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:51,429
to have

00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:19,390
11.2 that and then I'll take a question

00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:21,490
so you know I told you was hard how did

00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:23,560
we even get away with putting openoffice

00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,110
on these machines right my boss is late

00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:27,910
was my former boss was quite quite

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,320
innovative just call me used car

00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:31,120
salesman he's real good to get him up in

00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:33,580
front and talking to people and what he

00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,290
did was you know we had to upgrade

00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,450
offseason we have a choice a license is

00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:40,270
rough so we put a screenshot of office

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,130
2007 up put a screenshot office to the

00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:44,830
m3 up and in the middle you would open

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:47,050
office and he said and this was with the

00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:48,220
principals and administrators before we

00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,550
actually rolled this out we're trying to

00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,900
get some buy-in right and he said which

00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:55,870
one of these is the least scary to you

00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:58,810
because this is the one we have to go to

00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:00,520
and he pointed at the office 2007 or

00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:03,070
maybe this this is what we're running

00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,190
now and those principles were scared to

00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:08,230
death bad office 2007 like no we don't

00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:11,200
want to do that so we got the buy-in

00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:12,850
there's a little trick you know it but

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,670
it worked and we got the by invite

00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:17,530
administration we got the ok you know

00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:20,250
that's just a and you do have to be a

00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:20,250
little tricky yeah

00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:37,450
oh I'm glad you brought that up I don't

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:39,340
think I talked about too much lemon pie

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,440
I had a really cool opportunity to work

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:43,840
with aneesh chopra he was the secretary

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,710
of Technology for Virginia under King

00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:51,370
and he is an open source advocate I met

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,720
him at an award ceremony and you know HD

00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:55,899
now he's that you know CTO of the

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,690
country Obama just helped them right so

00:33:55,899 --> 00:34:00,940
I got to work with him and he just

00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:02,890
before he left to work for President

00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,510
Obama he started this really cool

00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,370
initiative in Virginia it's worth

00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:08,589
talking about glad you said that it's

00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:12,599
called a flex book so we in Virginia now

00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:16,960
have a physics book that is a wiki and

00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,040
12 12 teachers around the state this is

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,260
by the way this is completely open

00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,830
Creative Commons so you can go tell your

00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,659
school's about this right now so it was

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:28,869
created by 12 teachers in Virginia it

00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:33,010
was reviewed by students and peers

00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:35,409
teacher peers and now the curriculum of

00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:37,570
Virginia if you're if you're going to

00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:41,440
take physics you take it on an online

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:44,500
wiki so you saving costs of the price in

00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,710
textbooks and you're not learning off of

00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:50,169
a 35 year old textbooks a lot of things

00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,540
have changed in 35 years with physics

00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:54,040
right so someone could find out

00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:57,730
something new about black matter

00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:01,240
tomorrow and the next day the kids can

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:02,530
be learning about it fan-tastic ok this

00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,050
is pretty obvious stuff to all of you

00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:08,470
but not to educators not state entities

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,880
awesome initiative go Aneesh Chopra this

00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:11,950
isn't the CTO the country now it's

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,020
pretty hopeful isn't it he's a really

00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:15,520
cool guy I did the UM ideas that

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:18,010
Virginia Greg of which was first open

00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,220
source web site for a state of Virginia

00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:24,040
and he sported that he he he initialized

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,609
thats a really cool guy anyway position

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,609
aside yeah

00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:11,130
that's a great point it was a really

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:13,440
ugly transition when novell bought Susa

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,050
and they started moving because the old

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,150
mobile system was not a suicide right it

00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:19,859
was a completely different ball game and

00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,540
that so that migration is about a little

00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:24,030
tough but it is the perfect opportunity

00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:40,619
if the IT managers already used to that

00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:42,060
to talk to them and absolutely and

00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:44,099
that's why I'm here it is all about a

00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:58,710
grassroots effort without a doubt yes

00:36:44,099 --> 00:37:00,990
sir I don't know what I'm going to do

00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:04,369
because I can't afford why don't she was

00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,369
open office he said

00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:10,500
that's a travesty I mean it's social

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:12,840
responsibility I mean this is absolutely

00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,130
ridiculous and it is about use your user

00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,110
education you know this is a huge part

00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:18,420
of this which I didn't quite talk about

00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,370
but it is important we educate just the

00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,630
base user on even what openoffice and

00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:39,840
people don't even know that openoffice

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:53,130
exists sure yeah get them to commit

00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:55,290
right don't get too far heaven's sake

00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,410
would you be open to an idea like this

00:37:55,290 --> 00:38:12,660
they could save the state of Georgia

00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:15,960
potentially that's great and then they

00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:17,940
are because come on give me a break and

00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:19,980
you got in there becomes one of them

00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,080
pick it up some issues one of the last

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,730
will fit under this shoe and it goes all

00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,260
the way from Governor price down to the

00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,070
school board race you do the same thing

00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:30,450
and catch them all in a group have to

00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,920
individually see which one you think

00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:35,660
might be much

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,579
yeah and that's the person you ask when

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,260
they're all on stage they look like a

00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:40,700
smart superstar everybody else gets

00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:44,000
nervous and start asking their flunkies

00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:46,220
on the campaign that's a good a

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,049
fantastic way it is the perfect time to

00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:49,460
get commitments out of politicians when

00:38:48,049 --> 00:39:01,819
they're coming up for election so that's

00:38:49,460 --> 00:39:06,549

00:42:10,499 --> 00:42:14,759
hit by the rut get hit by a bus rule as

00:42:12,809 --> 00:42:16,499
an IT administrator you know go ahead

00:42:14,759 --> 00:42:17,970
and implement Drupal but make sure that

00:42:16,499 --> 00:42:20,339
if you get hit by a bus somebody else

00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:22,680
can do it right I cross-trained my

00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:24,749
assistant manager and I just left my job

00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:31,109
and you know he picked up that that I

00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:41,099
did my job right I yes ma'am teachers

00:42:31,109 --> 00:42:42,930
man yeah to learn learn the tools there

00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:44,430
are a lot I mean if you know especially

00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:46,710
with openoffice there's a ton of

00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:47,910
resources even just go to youtube

00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,799
although with the teachers probably

00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:53,940
blocked at school but download my home

00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:58,170
and bring them in open up and off his

00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,299
leg high school yeah yeah in fact

00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,559
there's an open open source book i

00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:04,859
believe on open office that you can just

00:43:01,559 --> 00:43:06,779
download in PDF form and also give a lot

00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:09,239
there's a lot there's a lot of great

00:43:06,779 --> 00:43:17,269
free resources she shoot me an email

00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:19,529
i'll give you a list okay yeah yeah oh

00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:21,089
yeah there.that yeah that's a great

00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:22,769
point so if you're running moodle it

00:43:21,089 --> 00:43:24,420
trigger at your school district you can

00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:26,009
actually just dump the course in its

00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:28,140
really cool it's like an importer and

00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:29,369
boom you've got training we actually I'm

00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,049
glad you pointed that out you know we

00:43:29,369 --> 00:43:32,519
actually trained our teachers on open

00:43:31,049 --> 00:43:35,579
office through Moodle and gave them

00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:37,980
recertification points which is so they

00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:39,599
were actually rewarded for learning it

00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,950
which is kind of a cool way to do it you

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,180
have to have supported to do that of

00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:44,180
course yes sir

00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:58,290
for education now see I'm an IT yah you

00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:58,290
want to ask that question sure

00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,329
is there anything new of them that down

00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:23,150
the pipeline that maybe teachers can

00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:48,290
utilize you know any good things check

00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:49,730
it out they're cool yeah cool I'm also a

00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,900
huge fan of the open disc which i

00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:53,299
already mentioned which also has the

00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,220
open education disc where you can get a

00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:57,559
lot of cool stuff that's open source

00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:59,480
that runs on windows if you're in a

00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,299
windows environment as far as cutting

00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,220
edge I'm not unfortunately I'm the guy

00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:05,900
who runs xenos and monitors network

00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,940
traffic someone else handles

00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:09,200
instructional software which I do get

00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,700
involved with it like I'm just I'm in a

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,049
job transition so I I don't know the

00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,760
cutting edge and so everybody else has

00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:23,450
any cool things please share them on

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:24,859
we're almost done here I think yeah good

00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,829
question see I need somebody's enhance

00:46:24,859 --> 00:46:31,390
that right so two to two initiatives

00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:34,130
first was two minutes sorry real quick

00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:36,290
the first initiative was vm what we

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,910
actually went with a vm our cluster and

00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,020
so we did spend money on it now no

00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:42,680
matter what whether it's free

00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:44,510
open-source if you virtualize virtual as

00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,970
your server environments you are going

00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,160
to save a lot of money on particular

00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:51,799
empower cost twenty three thousand

00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:55,549
dollars a month by consolidating from 18

00:46:51,799 --> 00:46:57,680
servers to three in power costs there's

00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:59,780
a calculator on vmware site that you can

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,119
use just empower costs you believe that

00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,609
crazy you can sell it real easy if you

00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:08,450
start doing those numbers and then also

00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:09,589
a open openvz cluster I've talked about

00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,450
on my podcast you can actually check

00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:16,760
that out but we cluster

00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:18,580
to openvz boxes together and ran you

00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,810
know that's that's a shared colonel

00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:22,790
virtualization solution that you can

00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,740
rsync actually sinks the virtual

00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:26,270
machines so you have redundancy really

00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:31,310
cool setup we did a lot of our web dev

00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:32,900
stuff on that I'd be happy to talk geek

00:47:31,310 --> 00:47:35,320
about you know a busy and stuff with

00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:37,640
anybody after after this or whatever
