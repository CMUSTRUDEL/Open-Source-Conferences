the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,390
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,769
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,080
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,560
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:21,660
southeast linux fest org thanks very

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,769
much it's a good to be here the session

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,330
should be interact we don't have a lot

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:25,859
of people here and there are sometimes

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,660
questions that people have that they

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,640
don't get around to asking if they wait

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,579
till the end so I've never been a big

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:36,000
fan of wait till the end so just ask me

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:38,309
we can make it very conversational the

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,530
whole notion is to have you understand

00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,780
some of the key issues around patents as

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,850
they relate to the Linux community the

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,940
open source community at large open

00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,050
source as a modality for invention and

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,969
the success of Linux as it marches from

00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,070
the back office transaction processing a

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,309
lot of a lot of what the public the

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:02,719
uninitiated public doesn't see to places

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:06,060
like the gphone and other environments

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,310
Ubuntu where it's certainly much more

00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,330
visible from the public standpoint so

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,890
for an agenda will essentially be will

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,450
just kind of talk about the context of

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,009
how this there's a secondary market

00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,350
that's been created for patenting and

00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:22,650
how that secondary market has emerged

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,049
and what it means in terms of the rise

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,840
of trolls how their activity has become

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:30,329
actually much more virulent over the

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,890
last five to seven years some of the

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,630
leading trolls some of the activities

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,850
they've been involved in visa V Linux

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,409
how those activities have been addressed

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:43,170
by the community some of the things that

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,810
that are happening in traditional patent

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:48,509
companies that also have impact on on

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,270
how electoral property intellectual

00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,700
asset management rights management

00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,399
should and could occur in the Linux

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,270
community I think there's a little bit

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,210
of an a merger of interest there and

00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:04,710
while we start out the community the

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,590
open source community certainly starts

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,830
out extremely antagonistic toward the

00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:12,260
notion of patenting I think there are

00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:13,879
activities short of patenting that

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,950
be quite beneficial I'll talk about

00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:18,560
those we'll talk a little bit about what

00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:22,159
we're doing at open invention network to

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:26,780
be able to ensure that patents don't

00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:28,730
create a have negative impact on the the

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,069
ecosystem and on the migration that I

00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,379
talked about earlier from the back

00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:37,209
office to more visible application

00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:40,489
environments that that people get very

00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:43,370
emotional about such as the desktop and

00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:45,470
the portable devices that are an

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:52,099
extension increasingly an extension of

00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:55,760
the desktop I think everybody

00:02:52,099 --> 00:03:00,709
understands the benefits of open source

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,810
and and and Linux I think we've got much

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,209
more opportunity for innovation there's

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,879
some good articles actually in in last

00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,950
week's or just a week that just ended or

00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,120
is ending today based on what they

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:16,010
published the Economist did section

00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,639
special section on innovation and how

00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,190
open source and Linux is creating new

00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,099
dynamics and more iterative innovation

00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:28,310
that's more cost-effective yields higher

00:03:25,099 --> 00:03:33,220
levels of innovation and is iterative so

00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:37,760
that it it creates higher levels of

00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:41,769
thought around around common problems in

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:46,069
terms of applications and services the

00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:50,510
the key for me is that when I took on

00:03:46,069 --> 00:03:54,199
this responsibility about 15 16 months

00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:56,150
ago I've had a very background I was a

00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,879
diplomat and worked on ultra property

00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,690
rights issues for the State Department

00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:02,449
negotiating agreements all throughout

00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,970
Asia I'm also worked as a consultant

00:04:02,449 --> 00:04:07,010
worked in private equity run a fund

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,829
focused on lending as against

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,489
intellectual property as an asset class

00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:16,820
a naked asset so that it was its own

00:04:13,489 --> 00:04:19,430
source of collateral and then coming to

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,000
this after a rather varied background

00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:26,240
intellectual property law and and

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,039
business I looked at this situation and

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,090
and thought this is truly an opportunity

00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:34,250
to leave a mark quietly but but to leave

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,009
a mark nonetheless one of the key

00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:40,190
features about my stewardship of open

00:04:37,009 --> 00:04:41,840
invention network is that the goal is to

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:44,539
work on the periphery of the community

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,419
and not to invade in the wonderfully

00:04:44,539 --> 00:04:49,849
elegant self-organizing self-regulating

00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:52,250
nature of what the the ecosystem really

00:04:49,849 --> 00:04:55,400
is so we work on the periphery to ensure

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:58,669
that patents don't have an impact in so

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,539
far as we can utilizing creativity

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,610
capital and an experienced team that

00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:06,050
understands patenting and understands

00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:08,690
the challenges associated with

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,750
litigation related to patenting and the

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:14,900
current regulatory environment but for

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,470
me the real appeal of Linux is that it

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:20,750
is the single it represents a modality

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:23,449
for invention more so than it does for a

00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,449
technology in the way I view it and and

00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,590
because of its positioning as they as

00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:32,090
the single most significant economic

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:36,560
economically powerful open source

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:38,780
initiative that to a real extent every

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,610
other initiative whether it be parallel

00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:46,699
or or secure or serially behind actually

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,590
as in a slipstream of Linux doesn't they

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:51,229
don't necessarily live and die by Linux

00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,360
but linux is extremely important in how

00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,880
open source ultimately has received the

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,370
receptivity in the community the

00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,259
attraction of capital private equity I

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,090
just spoke at a venture capital

00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:04,849
conference in San Francisco last week

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,099
talking to VCS about the importance of

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:08,870
investing in open-source companies

00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:11,030
broadly and in Linux companies

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,620
specifically some get it so we're

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,180
starting to get it because they've

00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,949
typically looked intellectual property

00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,289
is the critical component they want that

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,360
differentiation what I'm explaining to

00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:22,580
them is that it's really an environment

00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,870
which is open and closed it's not open

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,759
or closed and you have to really

00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:27,650
understand that that we're just going

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,810
higher up in the stack in a collaborate

00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,360
collaborative environment before we get

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,009
to layering on any kind of proprietary

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,020
applications if those are going to be

00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:38,020
layered on as part of the business model

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:45,240
from right to left this is all just kind

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,970
of creating a visual view of what I just

00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:53,180
described I think this is the great

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:53,180
thing about open sources from the early

00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:02,460
proselytization from the 60s and onward

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,670
it's made eminent sense that if you look

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,760
at how wireless technology evolved

00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:11,130
during the 60s 70s and 80s and into the

00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:15,630
90s we wasted an incredible amount of

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:17,850
money and we have lagged behind not only

00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:20,730
nationally but globally there's been a

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:23,390
lag compared to where the technology was

00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,650
good enough to actually be implemented

00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:28,920
seven to ten years before it actually

00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:31,950
was rolled out the US of course because

00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:35,520
we waited for cdma was another two years

00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:38,070
behind that so one of the things I see

00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,740
is this this incredible kind of

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:42,990
starburst model of invention that

00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,800
ultimately it yields new levels of value

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,690
new new where where the siloed level the

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,940
siloed invention that we did on the in

00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:53,160
that in the former forward days where

00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,060
company a company B Company C were

00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,460
involved in inventing discreetly and

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,220
then basically having to cross-license

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:06,680
each other after usually months if not

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:09,540
years of battling over patent rights

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,760
obviously thwarted the ability of users

00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:14,790
to jenna to to experience the benefits

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:18,180
and for the macroeconomy to see the

00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:20,100
benefits of Technology diffusion and I

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,660
think one of the great things about open

00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,940
source is that it creates connection

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,130
points for people around the globe I was

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:28,740
at the OECD about a month ago in Paris

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,290
and spoke to them about the whole notion

00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,930
of how this is one of the best if not

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:36,450
the best aid program that anybody could

00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:38,190
possibly create and the great thing

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,719
about it is it's not designed as an aid

00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,090
program obviously it's an unintended

00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:43,590
consequence that it creates engagement

00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,600
for the smartest and the best and the

00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:47,250
brightest the most creative people

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,470
around the world to be able to

00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,790
participate and for capital for those

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,670
people not to have to

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:57,690
my great as most of the VCS in the world

00:08:53,670 --> 00:09:01,650
are continuing to expect migrating to

00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,960
Silicon Valley or to route 128 or to RTP

00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,450
or other places around the world better

00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,880
technology centers but rather for

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:11,760
capital to flow to innovation where it

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,400
resides so its invention in place rather

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,380
than the creating the dislocation that

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,980
invention has required and because of

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,290
the the hedge emoni of capital in a very

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,050
few countries around the world and I

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,580
think this is one of the important

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,710
byproducts of this process which is

00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,380
incredibly appealing to be because of my

00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:37,140
my early career as a diplomat and my

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:41,130
goal of wanting to see development more

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,380
broadly diffused and people who are

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,450
extremely bright and talented in places

00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:47,640
around the world that I've I've traveled

00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:49,830
and worked to see those people actually

00:09:47,640 --> 00:10:01,590
engage around this this wonderfully

00:09:49,830 --> 00:10:04,260
elegant platform technology and and the

00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,570
whole notion of of kind of parsing out

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,490
your ear intangible assets has been

00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:11,310
something that well we don't value

00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,960
assets on the balance sheet yet we

00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:21,030
ultimately will as an aside Brookings

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:23,160
Institute did a study in 1970 and then

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:25,920
redid the study in two thousand and then

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,530
it was was updated by another firm about

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:31,200
three or four years ago and looked at

00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:34,140
the relative component value in a

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,540
company based on looking at its market

00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,730
cap and disaggregating it and seeing

00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,610
what was related to hard assets and what

00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,040
was related to intangibles it was

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,810
basically twenty percent intangibles in

00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,990
nineteen seventy and eighty percent hard

00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:50,820
assets when they redid the study in two

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:52,740
thousand they found it was it had

00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,630
completely flip-flopped so eighty

00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,550
percent of the value is in intangibles

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,520
and twenty percent was in hard assets

00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,920
and I think in the the g8 countries the

00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:03,120
g10 countries that's increasingly the

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,640
case as we move to

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,500
you an advanced service economy where

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,750
intellectual capital is the is the

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,480
single most significant source of value

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,610
that could be contributed and as a

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,020
result we've moved toward an environment

00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,730
where intellectual property as a

00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:21,300
codified form of intellectual capital

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:23,940
capital has actually become far more

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:27,180
significant and important in terms of

00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:29,670
the value of a company when companies

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,850
are acquired or when cut when assets are

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,020
sold off there's a lot more clarity and

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:40,220
focus on intangibles than there ever was

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:43,080
historically and so with that you have

00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,300
again VCS with an acute focus on

00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,460
unintellectual property as a source of

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,250
differentiation you've had a history of

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,720
large and small companies inventing and

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,980
codifying their inventions in the

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,610
foreign patents trademarks and

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:55,610
copyrights please

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:25,170
yeah actually algorithms if you look at

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:27,329
security software one of the reasons you

00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,889
don't see algorithms is that they stay

00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:30,149
as trade secrets but there are some

00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:32,100
algorithms that have actually been

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,689
patented they've been wrapped with other

00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,689
components similar to what you're

00:12:33,689 --> 00:12:41,609
describing I think is it just a comment

00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:45,209
we we don't mean we're supported by a

00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:49,799
bunch of very large companies IBM among

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:51,989
them novell Sony red hat companies that

00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,379
are you know they may patent something

00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:57,359
purely to open-source it like red hat or

00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:59,249
they may patent it and actually have

00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:02,660
very successful licensing programs like

00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:07,470
like IBM I think one of the challenges

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:09,899
for the regulators and the legislators

00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,199
right now who are creating what the

00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:14,850
regulatory roadmap will be is figuring

00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:18,149
out what should be patented what

00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,609
shouldn't be patented we kind of are

00:13:18,149 --> 00:13:23,879
okay we're in a position where we look

00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:26,749
at what is and we're less involved in in

00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:30,089
remaking the future other than giving

00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:32,040
community members tools so the patents

00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,169
no matter what the disposition is

00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,179
whether it's the the british patent

00:13:34,169 --> 00:13:38,669
offices view or the european patent

00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:41,119
offices via munich or the US patent

00:13:38,669 --> 00:13:44,369
offices view a je passe view in japan

00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:46,679
whatever happens there what we're trying

00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:49,410
to do is develop tools for the community

00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,829
to be proactive in codifying what it

00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:56,669
knows in an acceptable form that is not

00:13:52,829 --> 00:13:58,919
pat not patentable none on a non-patent

00:13:56,669 --> 00:14:04,110
like intellectual property asset and

00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:06,959
what that does if you if double the EE

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:09,360
community typically has had a certain

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,709
discipline around the engineering

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,600
notebook probably because they're

00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:14,879
socialized in large companies for the

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,079
most part as they grow up in codifying

00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,869
everything they have and have these

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,669
engineering notebooks in a in a computer

00:14:18,869 --> 00:14:22,470
science environment both academically

00:14:20,669 --> 00:14:25,589
and professionally there's less of that

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:28,470
culture and I think one of the things

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:28,950
that the EE community in generalists has

00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,320
been if

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:33,600
from is that culture because a lot of

00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,490
what they have they can invent in

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,430
creative ways to ensure that no one can

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,840
ever patent on top of them so I'm

00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:41,640
looking at it a little bit different way

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:44,460
rather than kind of you know being

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,810
another voice in Washington to say we

00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,300
need to do this so we need to do that

00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:50,490
you know in terms of patent reform I'm

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,230
looking at it saying regardless of what

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,880
they do they're not going to get it a

00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,740
hundred percent right it just doesn't

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,450
legislative process is about compromise

00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,680
you're not going to get what everybody

00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:00,720
wants especially when you got the

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,880
competing interests of the electronics

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,530
and telecommunications industry and

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,770
communications industry in general and

00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:09,150
you've got and the the other path that's

00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,570
pursued by the pharmaceutical industry

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:15,810
which is also a heavily patented heavy

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:18,450
patent environment and so in that

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,970
situation I'd rather work with the

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,670
community to give them tools to protect

00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:26,270
themselves regardless of what the policy

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:28,560
is that's just the approach we take

00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:30,210
patent offices the granted software

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,470
patents you think that you're you know

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:33,300
based on the rhetoric that there aren't

00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:35,460
software patents in Europe that's not

00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,990
the case there when you look closely

00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,550
there are lots of software patents in

00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,120
Europe nowhere as near as many as there

00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:43,680
are in the US but be that as may it's it

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,710
is a problem that actually is somewhat

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,660
widespread a reality of what we what we

00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:51,270
deal with every day is that there are

00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,240
certain companies Microsoft in the

00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:59,510
example i've used here that who's

00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:04,050
behaviors attitudes their DNA is

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:08,280
diametrically opposed to to seeing open

00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:10,610
source as a model prevail and linux as a

00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:13,110
particular instantiation of open source

00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:15,450
prevail as it's obviously very

00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:17,010
threatening to the franchise the

00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:20,970
franchise is where they make all their

00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:22,530
money not all but most they may generate

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:23,790
a lot of revenue in some of the new

00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:28,680
areas that they've grown over the last

00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:32,190
five years ten years but real profit

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:34,680
comes from franchise and boom to and

00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:36,870
other open source applications are

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:40,080
extremely threatening to the core

00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:41,270
franchise and to the not so successful

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,240
part of the french

00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,400
in the wireless space 7 has another

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,380
version coming out there's another

00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,450
version of siiii coming out and that

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:52,790
family of wireless apps they have their

00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:55,340
own device coming out in January on the

00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:57,260
verizon network which I think will be by

00:16:55,340 --> 00:17:01,510
my count the fourth hardware device that

00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:01,510
they'll have attempted to introduce the

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:06,459
approach that they're taking now is

00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:12,589
multi-pronged or if your small company

00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:16,040
you'll get a visitation that'll often

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:19,339
maybe you get a call one day you'll get

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:22,490
a visit the next day as evidence of the

00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:25,370
importance of this particular visit

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:29,000
which is essentially a what would be

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:31,610
termed in patent jargon a assertion

00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,600
where they'll talk about their patents

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:38,480
in very general terms and then commit

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,520
and visit the company and and be very

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:43,580
demonstrative about how that company

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,840
these are companies small companies i'm

00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,550
talking about companies with as little

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:49,370
as seven hundred fifty thousand a

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:51,950
million dollars in in gross revenue per

00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:54,590
year not profit these are companies that

00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:56,660
are not terribly successful web hosting

00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,310
companies they're they're a variety of

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:01,280
web hosting companies that have been run

00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,590
linux ubat approached and they're

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,450
encouraged sign an NDA which you should

00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,340
never sign an NDA you should get legal

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,400
legal counsel if you're approached by

00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:14,000
anyone who's asserting their patents in

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,220
particular if it's Microsoft what we're

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,770
trying to do is educate people to what

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,330
their rights are and it's very difficult

00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,600
because you've got a multi-billion

00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:26,240
dollar behemoth that's saying across the

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,820
desk from you in a nice shiny suit

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,250
that's telling you that that you're in

00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:32,870
violation of their patents and that they

00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,730
have patents that are relevant to Linux

00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,780
and that if you want to continue to run

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,070
Linux you're going to have to take a

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,800
license from the more they're going to

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:41,980
put you out of business in point of fact

00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:45,760
they don't put people out of business

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,830
they they like to huff and puff and and

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,470
but it is a rather insidious approach

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,980
that they take over all that's one one

00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:56,890
aspect other companies that are

00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:58,780
major customers where they have very

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:01,360
good relationships because they have

00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,980
multiple seats of Windows they'll go to

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,470
those companies and they'll talk to them

00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,910
about the idea of partnership and how

00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:09,340
they have these patents that read on

00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:12,760
Linux and they know that the company

00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:16,390
company a is also in addition to their

00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:17,980
Microsoft seats are also using Linux in

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:20,260
a variety of application areas and

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,730
increasingly using Linux and hate to see

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,179
that they would problem they would be

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:27,400
problems developed between such a

00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,410
long-standing partner and that you

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:31,240
should really take a license and and by

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:33,220
the way to make it easy will subsidize

00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,929
the license will just reduce your per

00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,240
seat cost for the next two years and

00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:38,650
we'll call it a specific license and

00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,360
you'll sign a license agreement and

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,340
there'll be specific patents that you're

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,169
taking a license to this is part of

00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,150
their totem building strategy this all

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:47,770
is what I'm describing is is what I've

00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,830
characterized as a totem building

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:52,770
strategy no one in any of the situations

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:55,270
that I'll describe looks at the patents

00:19:52,770 --> 00:20:02,520
that's not what this is about this is a

00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:05,200
form of well it's a it's it's a

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:09,510
encouragement or just a discouragement

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:13,900
from not from non-conforming behavior

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:16,270
that that they are very skilled in in

00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:19,990
bringing forward right now they they

00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:22,299
just did a tour of Japan and Korea you

00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:24,490
may have noticed that LG took one of

00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:26,919
these licenses that says now they're

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,990
safe for Linux because they've they've

00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,200
taken a license from Microsoft Microsoft

00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:35,500
no doubt needed some of the patents that

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:37,470
that LG has in a wireless space in the

00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,890
device space and in the display space

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,140
and and basically hoodwinked them into

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:46,690
taking a license to these very valuable

00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:50,320
Linux patents in return for gaining

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,880
access to patents that actually LG had

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,220
which are far more valuable than the

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,650
Linux patents that that are being hawked

00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:59,049
the whole notion is you take the fat

00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,600
patents just like they did in the in the

00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:04,299
tomtom case you wrap them with a four or

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,100
five other ten other patents that look

00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:06,850
like they might read on the and maybe

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,930
they are

00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:13,840
on core activities and applications of

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,960
the individual company or targeting and

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,210
then you you attempt to create a

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,040
situation which I'll just run through

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,430
the math for you so understand how this

00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:30,100
works when you're on the receiving end

00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:35,350
tomtom was in a situation where a an

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,820
international ITC action was filed which

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:39,490
cost you anywhere from eight to ten

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:41,380
million dollars to defend no ifs ands or

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,080
buts about it it's at least eight to ten

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,880
million dollars always it's everything's

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,210
on an accelerated time schedule and the

00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:51,940
real risk is injunction so you can't

00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,460
afford to be in joined when the the

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:58,180
setting tom-toms tom times like Kleenex

00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:03,310
in the in the nav space more so than how

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:05,260
we view garmin here tomtom you're going

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:08,500
to tomtom something it's like it's you

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:10,570
know it's the the Google set the tone

00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:12,640
and and other players have followed it

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,470
and the community whenever you're in

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,330
Britain or you're in the Netherlands or

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,220
in other countries in Europe if they

00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,930
want to find something that your

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:21,160
location that you're trying to find that

00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,560
they don't know offhand they'll say

00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:25,480
they'll tomtom it and that's what they

00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,670
do it's they have sixty-two percent

00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,100
market share wonderful access to the

00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,410
market I'm or a tax a market that that

00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:36,630
Microsoft covets Microsoft approached

00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:39,190
them and you know in a very passive way

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:42,610
had no active to cut discussions and

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,470
negotiations and then they received a

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,380
note in i guess it was februari of this

00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:52,330
year maybe it was March that that they

00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:54,430
were being sued and then we worked with

00:22:52,330 --> 00:23:00,190
them they had very good counsel work

00:22:54,430 --> 00:23:02,110
with them and the program was the

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:08,310
settlement was that you either settle

00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:12,909
for something which is non material by

00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:22,299
for reporting purposes from a

00:23:12,909 --> 00:23:25,090
a Netherlands or Holland based publicly

00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:27,159
traded market standards standard and so

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,590
it's it's in the hundreds of thousands

00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:32,080
of dollars you need to sign up and we

00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:33,609
can put you on the totem or it's going

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,639
to cost you eight to ten million dollars

00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:39,309
to defend the first ITC action we

00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:44,440
brought and then the suit that we filed

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:46,809
in in western Washington is going to

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,249
cost you another 5 million dollars three

00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:50,399
and a half to five million dollars to

00:23:48,249 --> 00:23:52,659
defend so when you're faced with

00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:55,479
capitulating and allowing them to do the

00:23:52,659 --> 00:23:56,950
press release which is really part and

00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:58,869
parcel that's what they want they want

00:23:56,950 --> 00:24:00,340
to control the press release this is

00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:02,710
this is the inner this the inner

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,529
workings of how this all plays out so

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,509
when you read a press release the lg's

00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,309
press release LG didn't do anything on

00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:11,889
the press release they just looked at it

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,840
and said yeah we coordinated on it but

00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:16,779
the key was for every one of these

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,059
totems that they that they have is

00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:20,619
ultimately they're building these totems

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:22,899
there to erect them and you know for the

00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:23,979
team picture in redmond and then they're

00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:25,419
going to say well look at all these

00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:29,019
companies that have taken a license

00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:31,059
these companies they've got really kind

00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:32,919
of expensive IP talent around them

00:24:31,059 --> 00:24:36,220
they've got long experience intellectual

00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,229
property development you know all these

00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:40,599
companies can't be wrong and that this

00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:42,399
this is theirs they're essentially

00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,080
creating the rebuttable presumption that

00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:45,820
everyone has to take a license because

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,389
their position is so relevant in the

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:51,899
market again it no one ever looks at the

00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:54,759
patterns we're looking at the patterns

00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:56,440
and we're inviting the community to

00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:58,749
participate in looking at those patents

00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,330
every time they show a patent it'll be

00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:03,519
up on on something that we we have in

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,379
linux defenders which is post issue

00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,239
period patent patents that are of low

00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:08,830
quality that should be out in the

00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:11,229
marketplace that we want to invalidate

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,659
we want crowd sourcing want the

00:25:11,229 --> 00:25:15,759
community to participate identify prior

00:25:13,659 --> 00:25:18,149
art so that we can request re exams and

00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,739
have those patents eliminated from the

00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:23,409
take another arrow out of the quiver of

00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:25,380
companies again it's a category of

00:25:23,409 --> 00:25:27,390
companies and microsoft is use

00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,820
as the most significant because it's the

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,730
largest and the most threatened by what

00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:36,090
linux represents but the whole notion is

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:38,790
to to look for bad patents that are held

00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:42,510
by antagonistic companies that represent

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:44,790
a source of irritant to the Linux

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:47,190
community the the key thing is that this

00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,050
is the open source community is so much

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:55,170
more mature than it was five six seven

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:57,990
years ago schoo was a was a mild kind of

00:25:55,170 --> 00:26:00,180
it it was a significant episode but in

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:02,370
retrospect if you put schoo in the

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,770
context of today schoo would be managed

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:07,140
very easily without kind of creating the

00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:11,070
gross fear uncertainty and doubt that

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,810
that microsoft lives on so I think those

00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,550
days are really gone and it's an

00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,980
attitudinal thing as well as a sense of

00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:18,630
maturity and the fact that that players

00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,300
have come into the community who are

00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:23,310
helping to navigate it's not just oin

00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:27,210
it's it's it's free software foundation

00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:29,130
Europe it's sflc and and it's also the

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,050
Linux Foundation their variety of

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,330
players that have come together with

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:36,000
capital and with commitments of large

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,550
mid and small company size and small

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,890
companies and developers the individual

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,440
developer representing their interest to

00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,490
make sure that that the market develops

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,320
in the way the market is going to

00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:47,790
develop without putting fingerprints on

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,490
it and say it needs to go this way

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:51,480
that's why I'm so first off the bat I

00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,380
want to make sure that everybody

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,300
understands it's not I'm not Hawking for

00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,810
the six companies that I that actually

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:03,270
have funded the fund that I manage the

00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,850
activities that I'm involved in they

00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:08,040
were they have a board which aids in

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,260
guiding my activities but we have

00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:12,810
autonomy to use capital to make a

00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:15,690
difference to do what's necessary to

00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:18,150
ensure that Linux is free and open and

00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:20,220
that can develop as as the community

00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:22,710
sees appropriate that's the great thing

00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,510
about it it's not one company dictating

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:26,100
how the community is going to develop or

00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:31,050
how a technology or an application is

00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:33,990
going to develop and so we kind of view

00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:36,810
it as a point we're kind of Pete past

00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,630
the point where Microsoft or others who

00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:40,600
are aunt

00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:44,070
medical to true innovation and would

00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:47,200
like to have us be suborned to and

00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:48,970
relegated to the incremental levels of

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,870
incremental innovation that they dole

00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:57,490
out periodically in order to be

00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:59,530
positioned well in order for them to be

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,330
successful in accomplishing what they'd

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:05,380
like to accomplish which is too slow or

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:07,900
stall the day is gone the horse is out

00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,270
of the barn and it's it's miles away

00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:12,760
from from where they're able to track it

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:15,460
down and one of the key things is the

00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,140
reasons for that is it's a social it's a

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,700
social phenomenon as much as it is a

00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,830
technologically development approach or

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,320
anything else people collaborating

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,540
together creating new new creating

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,700
higher forms of value by thinking

00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,520
together is the idea of one plus one

00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,680
equals three or five or ten but it

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,000
doesn't equal to any more when you when

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,540
you work together in a collaborative

00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,630
environment an open source and Linux and

00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:46,480
that phenomenon is so powerful that it

00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,790
sees the the attention of people in

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,320
Washington in the new administration and

00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:52,510
former administration's as well as

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:55,420
people in the European Commission people

00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:57,220
in jaypaw people in India Brazil China

00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,380
everywhere around the world people

00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,580
recognize the value of open source and

00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:08,430
the value of linux and and the irritants

00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:10,870
that that Microsoft and and other

00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:13,570
operational kind of initiatives that

00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:15,610
they have underway are simply that and

00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,110
that's why we're here and that's why

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,940
some of those other organizations are

00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,310
around is to make sure that we're able

00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:24,640
to broadcast and narrowcast the message

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:27,250
I view myself as a as someone who has to

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,860
proselytize the importance of community

00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:31,270
participation and I'll talk about some

00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:35,220
of the programs and I think the

00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,220
community can participate in yes

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:49,059
and I like a challenge this could

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:51,490
discontinuous innovation is all in favor

00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:55,299
of discontinuous innovation main

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:58,210
controller I do a lot of work with open

00:29:55,299 --> 00:30:01,000
animation they come and one of the

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,520
things that we asked them to draw call a

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,250
primate diagram we win this one for

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,720
example and in the center of that for

00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:10,690
the things that are the most strategic

00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,600
fill their cases literally their secret

00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:15,970
sauce rubber they'll talk anybody about

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,679
it and if you were a challenge Michelin

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,679
there they would do everything to act to

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,480
fight my tongue outside measurable are

00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:24,429
things that are still strategic to them

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,620
molding but they may not be the best in

00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,330
the world a little bit more open the

00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:30,220
beach willing to be open but they're

00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:33,070
going to be attorneys involved and then

00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,960
most everything else is things that

00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,700
they're very comfortable environmental

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,200
standards quite frankly they want to

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:40,510
find an expert they don't want to do it

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,049
themselves and so they're willing to be

00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:47,710
open the way you talk about things that

00:30:44,049 --> 00:30:49,630
aren't a part of that core and i agree

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:51,820
with you know pretty much how you said

00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:53,830
going about the approach but i think

00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:56,440
it's important when you think about it

00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,480
helping kind of understand why do we act

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,580
in the way they are when you kind of

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,960
poke them in the core there they're

00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:04,120
going to fight back and that's what

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,580
Microsoft do it and yet at the same time

00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,919
they can be very defensive there that

00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:12,500
can actually be very open in other

00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:16,410
places in the more you come on

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:19,050
yeah I you know I think they they need

00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:21,840
to be open where Apple needs to be open

00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:24,120
Apple needs to be open at the edge to

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,620
get tens of thousands hundreds of

00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,630
thousands of developers around their

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:33,420
platforms but my view is that yeah yeah

00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:35,460
well the culture is more closed but they

00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,550
are open in that respect because

00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:39,450
application development needs to be

00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,920
innovation happens at the edge it

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:43,380
doesn't happen at the core whether it's

00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:45,390
Michelin whether it's Bridgestone or any

00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,010
other company you get 500 people in a

00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,230
company and you've already started to

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:51,360
move away from the kinds of

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,980
discontinuous innovation that creates

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:55,320
new market or radically redefines

00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,290
existing ones that's what I'm looking

00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:02,190
for is those opportunities and that's

00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:04,470
why in university education if you think

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,600
you're going to find the edge of what's

00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:10,050
happening in business management at

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,330
Harvard if you're not it's the places

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:14,250
that they draw ideas from because the

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,500
edge of any whenever you get to the

00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,150
center you lose the opportunity for this

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,380
is kind of a separate discussion on on

00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:24,710
it's that same form it's the same

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:28,560
diagram that was used it at tuc about

00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:31,140
3540 years ago as to describe starburst

00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,560
models of innovation and that's what I

00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,540
mean the actually the CTO at Microsoft

00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,410
understands this very well because take

00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:41,610
an absolutely worthless company lotus is

00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:44,250
absolutely worthless you could have just

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,650
shut you pay the power bill that's about

00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:48,870
it there's one two three had been run

00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:52,050
down by Microsoft like a tank in the

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:54,360
early 90s the only thing they had left

00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:58,200
for thirteen entities that they set up

00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:01,170
outside that were all managed designed

00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,420
by Jim Manzi and managed by ray ozzie

00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,890
one of them happened to be notes they

00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,240
got four billion dollars for a company

00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,280
that otherwise would have been worthless

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,860
through only three and a half years of

00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,680
development that's that's the starburst

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,730
model of organization writ large thermo

00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,170
electron their whole bunch of other

00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,180
companies that use it because you can't

00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:20,040
innovate at the levels you want to

00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,690
inside companies but it's a little bit

00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,490
of a divergence but I'm more than happy

00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:26,240
to talk about innovation strategy

00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:26,240
offline

00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:35,999
data turn this is a suit that was

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:41,220
brought last April 21st was settled in

00:33:35,999 --> 00:33:44,039
about 10 12 weeks by the defendant in

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:47,369
this case was red hat and 25 of its

00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:51,570
closest and largest customers one of the

00:33:47,369 --> 00:33:56,940
things that's happening is that as Linux

00:33:51,570 --> 00:34:01,409
is becoming more more prevalent in large

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:03,149
deep-pocketed users that trolls have

00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:04,879
become attracted to the opportunity

00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:09,809
space trolls or companies who are

00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:11,819
generally know generally non-practicing

00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:15,119
entities sometimes they're formally

00:34:11,819 --> 00:34:19,139
practicing entities companies who we

00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,419
think about a company like Qualcomm as

00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,829
being very successful clearly they

00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,280
developed a standard the government

00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:28,500
facilitated them actually being the

00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,089
adopted standard but they in point of

00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,549
fact they're a failure as an operating

00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:34,319
company their operational strategy was

00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:36,569
to be a hardware maker they're also did

00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:37,889
licensing they got out of that business

00:34:36,569 --> 00:34:39,809
because they recognize they're not good

00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,490
at it so in some sense they're formerly

00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:43,829
practicing entity that utilizing their

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:46,349
patent portfolio creatively to be able

00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:48,389
to support technology development and

00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:50,760
they do reinvest in technology

00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:53,369
development but more traditional trolls

00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:57,149
are an fian is the owner of data turn

00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:59,010
they picked up data turn and and are

00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:01,559
looking to have been looking to leverage

00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:04,260
the electoral property assets they filed

00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,630
suit against Red Hat be of a whole

00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,329
series of banks and travel related

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,750
entities online and and brick-and-mortar

00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:20,339
and they ultimately put put forward a

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:24,750
program designed to whatever word you

00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:27,599
want to use the litigation avoidance is

00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:29,520
really what litigation cost avoidance is

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,230
really what a troll is about they know

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,880
it cost you between three and a half and

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:37,319
five million dollars to defend the suit

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,530
to take it to term 22 jury and if they

00:35:37,319 --> 00:35:40,750
can settle

00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:46,000
like one of the leading trolls is acacia

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:48,460
acacia right now has 36 active lawsuits

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,030
going concurrently against different

00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,700
defendants it buys patents or coops

00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:57,880
owners acid needs of patents owners of

00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:01,090
patents to get into a fee splitting

00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,570
arrangement and manages through a series

00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:07,180
of contingency lawyer and analyst

00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:09,400
relationships a network of individuals

00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:10,930
and they bring suit that's their

00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:15,430
business they built they do know

00:36:10,930 --> 00:36:17,430
technology development they purely flip

00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:20,020
patents for the purpose of creating

00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:22,540
revenue for their shareholders they're

00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:26,500
publicly traded company based in

00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:29,440
California and they have a suit against

00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,510
which is application related it's not

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:36,280
really a Linux suit but it's against Red

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:38,650
Hat as well and they're a series of

00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,780
these suits that really are not salient

00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:42,760
to the colonel but they deal with core

00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,850
applications that are maybe uniquely

00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,910
enabled by the colonel by the by Linux

00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:50,680
they're not of grave concern other than

00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:54,370
that they've represented annoyance and

00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:56,980
they mislead people like Jamie Dimon who

00:36:54,370 --> 00:37:00,550
has a rather significant network Jamie

00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:02,140
Dimon runs JPMorgan Chase if it's going

00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,880
to discourage him he's a guy that reads

00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,680
the headlines he doesn't read below the

00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:08,530
headline he gets his information from

00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,820
his people on a lot of areas or he picks

00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:11,860
up the phone if he wants to know about

00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,690
something and can access pretty much

00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:15,730
anybody but he's not a good stroke if

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,250
he's going to hesitate on a 10 million

00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:20,560
dollar check for an install of Linux to

00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,710
upgrade some aspect of their network

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,630
operations because he's concerned that

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:29,200
Linux is you know there are a lot of

00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,880
lawsuits related to Linux it's it's not

00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,290
the reality it's the perception of

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,660
reality that we have to be concerned

00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:36,610
about as well at least in my position I

00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,740
am so one of the things I look to do is

00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:41,350
a nerd i troll behavior by getting in

00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:44,530
front of them we have several lawsuits

00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:46,950
that we have staved off by working with

00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:49,000
trolls and either identifying

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,119
significant prior art in the patents

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,160
they were going to assert so that they

00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,619
they went back and reconsider their

00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,789
position or we've we've negotiated

00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:01,619
agreements at very modest terms to take

00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:03,749
patents off the table that otherwise you

00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,579
would have been used for these these

00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:07,200
what I'll consider one thin claim

00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,910
lawsuits because that's about all what

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,269
it's about all you need to actually

00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:14,369
sustain a lawsuit sufficient to to get

00:38:12,269 --> 00:38:17,960
your payoff Acacius settlements or

00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:20,490
average from 700,000 22 to 1.3 million

00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,349
because it represents an avoidance of

00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,900
going forward with litigation you

00:38:22,349 --> 00:38:27,720
actually save money by by succumbing to

00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,089
their extortionate practices and so this

00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,119
is this is something that the Pat reform

00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:36,150
is looking to address and all of the

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,180
companies that are represented as the

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,609
investors in oin and and hundreds of

00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:45,690
other companies have real concerns with

00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:49,579
the impact on innovation and the and the

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:53,759
cost effectiveness of or the cost

00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:58,819
detriment that is yielded by the

00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:58,819
continued proliferation of troll models

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,049
and Fiona's i said earlier Keysha i

00:39:02,099 --> 00:39:07,589
described brehm brandt is a very focused

00:39:04,049 --> 00:39:11,099
role they buy all their portfolios and

00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:15,059
they do maybe two or three litigation

00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,950
actions a year they're generally a lot

00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:19,710
more thorough than the other two and

00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:21,960
then intellectual Ventures has a those

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,730
of you not aware i have them in Firenze

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:26,400
because it's not it's not clear that

00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:28,980
they are a troll they have not asserted

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,359
and litigated against against anyone

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,029
they've asserted actually they haven't

00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:34,859
litigated which is basically bringing

00:39:33,029 --> 00:39:36,329
their patents out and saying that you're

00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,950
going to need our patents to continue to

00:39:36,329 --> 00:39:41,700
run your business but they haven't

00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:44,460
litigated but they have gathered over

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,470
the since 2000 when they formed they've

00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:48,779
invested over four billion dollars they

00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:50,190
have what they haven't invested we're

00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:52,259
four billion they have still some of

00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:53,430
that capital but they raised four

00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,900
billion dollars and they've acquired

00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:57,720
twenty four thousand nine hundred

00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,539
patents by last count which is a very

00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,170
significant number of patents they have

00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:03,170
for funds

00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:16,830
yep excuse me intellectual Ventures is

00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:21,090
very interesting it's Nathan Myhrvold

00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:23,970
who used to be the CTO of Microsoft who

00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:27,359
is a friend of Bill not so much a friend

00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:29,520
of the current administration but he and

00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:31,160
Bill were thick as thieves and and

00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,840
really support the whole idea of

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,380
innovation in in you know at a high

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:40,800
level I think to your point they were

00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:42,480
minute away from the fact that if it

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,640
were not for Microsoft we would not be

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,130
where we are with personal computing it

00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,920
mean it a major innovation was stewarded

00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,630
by that company the problem is when

00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,100
you're a monopolist you act as

00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:55,080
monopolist and when you have no role

00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:57,180
models it's very difficult to have any

00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:00,090
expectation if your only role model is a

00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:02,760
company that that basically had us

00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:07,470
flying around in in technology that was

00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,880
30 years old until the Europeans got

00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:11,400
together and decided to do something

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,890
about it it just doesn't make for a

00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,609
great environment I mean as independent

00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:20,090
and and and fiercely fiercely

00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:24,630
competitors John Chambers is at Cisco

00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:29,400
the legacy of Hewlett and Packard and

00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:31,950
the be the the the appropriateness of a

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,350
model of operation of a business was

00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:38,010
laid out by Hewlett and Packard as well

00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:40,290
as by bavarian early on and in the

00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:43,320
valley and there was a certain code a

00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:46,350
certain kind of social compact of

00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:49,500
appropriate behavior even Larry Ellison

00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:52,170
in his better days as is you know

00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:54,950
understands that that code very very

00:41:52,170 --> 00:42:00,030
well in fact he's a student of that code

00:41:54,950 --> 00:42:02,580
but i think the the key here is what

00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,290
will happen we don't know but i think it

00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:08,690
bears watching because they have a very

00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:11,340
significant storehouse of patents and in

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,530
response defensive patent pools have

00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,550
arisen and these patent pools you can

00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:19,950
expect to work together in the future

00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,390
because it's all about dealing with the

00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,460
billions of dollars have been raised on

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:25,170
the other side in some sense it's a very

00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,500
inefficient process because on the one

00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:32,220
side you've got corporate troll activity

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,130
as I've described for Microsoft and and

00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,710
and and traditional what it has become

00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,270
traditional non-practicing entity troll

00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:42,420
activity on the other side of you've got

00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:46,619
oh I am in a very focused defensive

00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:49,170
patent pool again with our acute focus

00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:52,560
on Linux and then a light security trust

00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:55,380
their first fund & RPX each of them have

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,580
did each entity has different ways of

00:42:55,380 --> 00:43:02,880
proceeding we don't generate any profit

00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,740
we don't generate any revenue we don't

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,020
break even we don't attempt to break

00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:11,220
even ours is a this is a mission to to

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:13,619
ensure that there's a level playing

00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:16,410
field and that open source and Linux

00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:17,640
survives Alec security trust represents

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:20,220
the interests of a select group of

00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,570
companies RPX represents the interests

00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,760
of a select group of companies as well

00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:25,500
but they're acutely focused on

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,290
generating profit but nonetheless

00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,390
because they have a in their their

00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:33,690
bylaws the inability to assert and

00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:35,910
litigate there there's someone that can

00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:40,619
be worked with they tend to buy patents

00:43:35,910 --> 00:43:42,930
that are of lower quality not always but

00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,730
uh generally ones that better troll bait

00:43:42,930 --> 00:43:46,850
that trolls would love to have because

00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:49,020
they represent potentially large

00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:56,130
settlement opportunities or many many

00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:59,880
suit opportunities clearly what's going

00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:02,940
on in the patent world is a skip ahead

00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:08,490
to this from two sides there's a bit of

00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:14,100
convergence large companies IBM phillips

00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:18,810
of the netherlands motorola nokia

00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:21,960
siemens ericsson all those companies are

00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:25,260
have independently come to conclusion

00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:28,440
that just patenting for patenting sake

00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:29,940
is no longer the way forward and what

00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:33,599
they've started to do

00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:37,079
has reduced the number of patent

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:38,460
applications that they file and start to

00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:41,520
increase the number of defensive

00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,650
publications defensive publications are

00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,960
in some sense on anti patent for the

00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:48,839
open source community and in another

00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:51,060
sense for a large company that is

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,550
seeking to grow patent portfolio it's a

00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:56,730
far more cost-effective way of ensuring

00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:58,790
that your you're practicing appropriate

00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:01,500
intellectual property rights management

00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:04,410
the patents when you have a really good

00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,880
patent you want to wrap it with the

00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,650
reason why you develop all these other

00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,500
patents is you'd building a family the

00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,450
family is essentially protecting their

00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:14,640
all these child patents around this core

00:45:12,450 --> 00:45:16,680
but you're protecting the patent from

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,290
being attack having its core claims

00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,270
attacked and being weakened by third

00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,310
parties who come later with other

00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:28,849
inventions that look at the extensions

00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:28,849
of the core claims and in this situation

00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:35,880
in this situation you've got I just

00:45:32,790 --> 00:45:38,670
couldn't see the tubes or in this

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:40,470
situation you have a combination of

00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,180
patenting and defensive publications

00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:43,890
you've got the core Pat and you wrap it

00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:45,930
with defensive publications which are

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:48,390
not things that can restrict people's

00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:52,050
behaviors other companies behaviors

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:54,060
they're essentially statements that are

00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,530
very much like they have they don't have

00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,790
claims but they're very much like a

00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,560
patent they would otherwise be

00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:00,750
patentable except they don't have claims

00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,130
but the interesting thing about them and

00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:04,050
why I think the particular relevant to

00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:07,410
the open source community is because

00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:09,240
these defensive publications can never

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:12,270
be used to restrict the behaviors of

00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:15,210
others but they do represent prior art

00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,920
so if we get the community if all the

00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:18,660
developers in the community would start

00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,599
to codify what they know and what

00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:23,160
they've invented we wouldn't have three

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,450
or four or five years later someone

00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:26,490
inventing the same thing that they

00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:27,780
invented and then having everybody be

00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:31,910
upset and think that the patent system

00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,910
stinks yeah

00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:44,880
where are you going to publish it though

00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:47,190
yeah it's not enough because the key

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,720
piece that's missing is that it's not

00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,270
accessible to patent and trademark

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,130
office examiner's so the patent examiner

00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:55,500
has to find it and we can't rely on

00:46:53,130 --> 00:46:57,990
Google no matter how evolved google gets

00:46:55,500 --> 00:47:00,570
and I know Chris DiBona is here we're

00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:02,340
not going to get there because this is

00:47:00,570 --> 00:47:04,260
something that's extremely challenging

00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:05,940
you've got basically delivered on a

00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,430
platter there's something called IP com

00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:10,410
we bear all the costs of the creation of

00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:11,700
these defensive publications we're

00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,000
inviting the community and to

00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:17,010
participate we're doing I'm running at a

00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,540
time but essentially this program at the

00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,270
bottom Linux defenders is one of the

00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:22,650
things i want to emphasize today is that

00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:24,600
we're looking at poor quality

00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,460
applications to get to eliminate those

00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:28,230
through peer to patent that's what

00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,090
that's about go to the website and look

00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:31,560
at it if you get a chance post issue

00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:33,300
period of patent as I described earlier

00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,250
bad patents that have already been

00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,110
granted we want to eliminate those so we

00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:39,270
need the crowdsourcing support to

00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:42,180
identify prior art contributed we'll

00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,970
make sure that it's it's it's useful in

00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:47,130
defeating these patents in the in

00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:48,720
validating patents that exist defensive

00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,450
publications essentially what I'm just

00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:54,780
describing if we codified what we knew

00:47:51,450 --> 00:47:56,910
then we get so much in prior art that we

00:47:54,780 --> 00:48:00,350
wouldn't get people getting patents on

00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,350
things that are well known yes

00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,080
many there I think it's there's just you

00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,340
know rather than kind of get wrapped

00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:23,050
around the axle about that question

00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,300
maybe SD comes up all the time and

00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:27,580
discussions particularly in Europe but

00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,920
it's not something if you if you could

00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:32,200
go back to the beginning that's

00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:34,000
different but you can't kind of in the

00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:37,450
midstream go back and do that

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,280
efficiently so these are essentially the

00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:42,010
programs these slides will be available

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,630
for people want one access to them what

00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:45,250
we're trying to provide is freedom of

00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,150
action and freedom to operate and that's

00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,790
why we're trying to get the community

00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:51,490
mobilized to actually codify its

00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:55,660
inventions in a socially acceptable way

00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:58,420
by the communities ethic and that's what

00:48:55,660 --> 00:49:00,280
defense of publications represent and

00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:02,650
again it's the whole idea of one plus

00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,240
one does not equal just two but by

00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:06,220
working together we can deal with these

00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,560
patent issues and we can also deal with

00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:10,119
some of the broader issues of you know

00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:11,830
where Linux is going if you don't have

00:49:10,119 --> 00:49:13,330
to worry about patent issues which is

00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:14,560
what we're trying to do we think the

00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:16,930
community is going to be much healthier

00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,900
in terms of developing its own kind of

00:49:16,930 --> 00:49:24,609
shadow road map of where it needs to go

00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:26,740
in some of the key areas so anyway part

00:49:24,609 --> 00:49:29,700
of what I'm proposing is market lead

00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:32,170
patent reform let's not let the let

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,330
legislators and regulators and judiciary

00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:37,510
try and solve the problem themselves if

00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,160
we participate by utilizing defensive

00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:41,589
publications and utilizing these other

00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,330
tools under linux defenders we're going

00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:46,390
to be in a lot better position than we

00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:48,970
are right now and that's my mobile

00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,170
number anyone anytime should feel free

00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:52,570
to call me no matter where they are in

00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:54,640
the world I listen to people you know

00:49:52,570 --> 00:49:58,180
where we have something called Linux

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,920
defenders 911 and we take it very

00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,990
seriously we get a lot of good leads

00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,900
about lawsuits or people who are being

00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:07,630
being bothered and patent issues where

00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:09,940
we want to be as immersed in the

00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,010
community as we can given the fact that

00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,630
we live on its border patrolling the

00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,730
border to make sure patents don't affect

00:50:13,630 --> 00:50:18,369
the way of life of people who are

00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:20,170
contributing to this this incredibly

00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:22,410
vital community thank you very much for
