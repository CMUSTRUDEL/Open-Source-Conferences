the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,390
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,769
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,080
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:17,550
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,770
southeast linux fest org hey it's really

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,619
great to be here I'm send me for a while

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,240
this is Brian Pitz Brian pizza is

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,010
currently involved with free IT Athens

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,630
so I invited him to come and talk kind

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,050
of about what free IT Athens is doing

00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,890
right now one thing I don't want to do

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,590
is I don't want to give the impression

00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:36,660
that what we're about to talk about here

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,329
is something that that's just going on

00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,980
in the round the southeast this is

00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:42,809
really sort of a movement that's

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,340
happening across the country and in fact

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,430
when we started free IT athens a few

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:48,840
years ago we had the idea we realized

00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,820
there was other organizations doing

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,160
similar things and and so it seems like

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,210
it's much bigger than just us we're

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,680
going to tell you about three

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,500
organizations around the southeast today

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,239
primarily because we want to convince

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:04,409
you because well we know the most

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,580
develop them but we also want to

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,970
convince you that this is completely

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,110
doable on sort of any any level but the

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:14,130
three organizations that we're going to

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,360
tell you about kind of have varying sort

00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:20,970
of has their own spin on the same idea

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,610
so the to start with what we wanted to

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,439
do is kind of kind of Brian Pitz and I

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,689
and Kevin Jones who's that who's running

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,890
the free Linux PC project kind of got

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:30,960
together and talked a little bit about

00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,270
why we decided to do this and we came up

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,479
with some problems in particular that we

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:38,340
thought that our approaches try to solve

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,840
in some way so I'm going to talk about a

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,320
few things right here at the beginning

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,930
that may seem a little disconnected but

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,020
that hopefully it all come together and

00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:51,920
by by the end so how many of you guys

00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:56,000
know about this thing called the GPL

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
right so what is the GPL

00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:02,270
right they can do general public license

00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,670
what does it do yeah it guarantees

00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,440
freedoms right in some sense it's like

00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,479
it's like the Constitution or the bill

00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,700
of rights in some ways so I have some

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,250
questions that I just want you to think

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,840
about for a second um if I don't have

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,400
access to the computer do I still have

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,470
the freedoms that are guaranteed by the

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,820
GPL yes absolutely do I have the

00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:25,340
freedoms guaranteed by the GPL if I

00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:29,060
don't know how to access study or modify

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,550
the source code technically i do right

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,230
technically i have the ability to do any

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:39,500
of these things guaranteed by the GPO

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:41,480
but effectively I don't write it's sort

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,890
of like the same problem as if I asked

00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,100
do I still have freedom of speech if I

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,330
don't have a voice do i do I saw freedom

00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,420
of the press if I'm illiterate and I

00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:52,910
can't right right so technically we do

00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,860
have freedoms guaranteed by the GPL but

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,269
effectively we don't if we don't have

00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:59,989
access to a computer and we don't know

00:02:56,269 --> 00:03:02,120
how to modify the source code so what we

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:03,110
is is open source advocates and I think

00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,019
that part of the reason we're all here

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,519
today is because we have we're partially

00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:09,769
advocates for open source and free

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,799
software we have to ask ourselves how

00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:14,150
important are these freedoms to us

00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,820
freedom of speech and freedom of the

00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:18,019
press and things like that are very very

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,079
important and they've been important for

00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:23,989
a very very long time so at this point

00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:27,170
it's codified in the Constitution and we

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:31,430
spend a lot of time teaching kids and in

00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,750
society about these freedoms right every

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,829
kid knows that they have freedom of

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,910
speech by the time they get to high

00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:36,769
school and freedom of the press and

00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,450
they'll say that I mean even little kids

00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:40,850
will say I have freedom speech I can say

00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:42,799
whatever I want so it's it's a it's a

00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:45,709
common thing that we all are aware of

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,420
very early on unfortunately it's not

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,820
true with the freedoms guaranteed by the

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,549
GPL so if we think that these are

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:54,859
important we need somebody to be out in

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:58,810
the communities teaching these things to

00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:00,680
kids and to society as a whole as about

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,299
about the freedoms that are guaranteed

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:05,620
by the GPL and what they can do for us

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:09,860
well how we can use them effectively uh

00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:12,560
so so yeah

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,870
so basically the point is is if we're

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,310
going to believe that these freedoms are

00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,900
really really important we need to be

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:19,489
the ones doing it because nobody else is

00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,680
going to do it the education system has

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:22,760
enough stuff on their plate already it's

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,620
going to be us those of us that are

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,210
advocates doing it the other thing I

00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,310
wanted to bring up is that in this day

00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,710
and age technical skills equals power

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,220
right if we have technical skills we

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:35,750
have power I think that a lot of times

00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:37,160
though those of us that are involved in

00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:39,110
the open source movement kind of take

00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,930
for granted some of the technical skills

00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,270
that we do have but not everyone has for

00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:48,290
instance how many of you can easily

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,240
create an electronic resume help

00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,520
everyone I'm seen not seeing all the

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,680
hands yeah so most of you guys have no

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,120
problem creating a resume and would

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,520
never even think twice about it not

00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,470
everyone has that power not everyone is

00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,510
knows about how to use the internet and

00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:05,390
can find a job on craigslist and in this

00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:07,250
day and age where the jobs are few and

00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,890
far between they need to be able to know

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,200
how to do that um the internet actually

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,370
gives us the opportunity to use some of

00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,930
these other freedoms that we're talking

00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,520
about like freedom of speech we can

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:18,590
speak our mind and find an audience

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,510
right what about the people that don't

00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:23,270
have access to the internet that don't

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:24,950
know how else to actually speak their

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,500
mind or find an audience this is this is

00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:29,300
an opportunity to give them out power

00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,710
but the other thing is that we sometimes

00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,540
take for granted is we have the ability

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,330
to build for instance the next big

00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,979
social media application so I'm going to

00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,419
tell a quick story when I first started

00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:41,210
out at free IT happens when we first

00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:43,479
started our big recycling program there

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,560
was a gentleman that came in that was

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:46,850
really really excited because we were

00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,890
going to give him a computer after 12

00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:49,970
hours of community service and Brian

00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:53,960
will talk a little bit about that in a

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:55,970
second but he wanted to get a laptop for

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,169
his daughter and he was like he was very

00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,970
excited about getting a laptop or his

00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:00,080
daughter so he he came in and he was

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,550
really gung-ho he was getting into

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,870
everything he was wanting to know how

00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,600
everything was working he was asking us

00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,070
how how we were doing things on the

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,300
computer and all these other things at

00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,860
the end of the 12 hours he got his

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,910
laptop I gave him my phone number and I

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:12,950
was like you know if you ever have a

00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,860
problem just give me a call and I want

00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:17,120
you to uh feel free to call me and I'll

00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,620
be happy to try to walk you through

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,820
stuff on the phone so so he did it a

00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,660
couple done so he called me and I would

00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,240
walk him through stuff on the phone but

00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:26,229
one day I got a phone call from him

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,880
and who's calling me with an idea he was

00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:32,530
like this is an older guy I mean he's

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,090
pretty old it he was telling about a

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:36,130
time that he worked in the grocery

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,410
stores are clerk and he had this idea on

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:40,270
how to uh well I don't want to give away

00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,430
the idea because he didn't give me

00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:45,250
permission to but the point is he had an

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:47,199
entrepreneurial idea that was generated

00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,870
by the time he spent with us at free IT

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,610
happens right I mean and this is really

00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:53,319
sort of exactly what we want to do we

00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,289
want to show people the power that they

00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,400
have with the technology and the way

00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,380
that you can ways that you can be

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,349
creative with it and it's entirely

00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,729
possible that a lot of people just

00:07:01,349 --> 00:07:06,430
haven't had the opportunity to see that

00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:09,490
sort of thing how many you guys heard of

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,310
the digital divide yeah the digital

00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:14,530
divide it's sort of the idea that

00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,120
there's this this this global digital

00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,500
divide where a lot of people have access

00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,300
to computers and a lot of people don't

00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:21,069
and the ones that don't have access to

00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:25,030
computers and technology are falling

00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:27,009
behind in the United States we have a

00:07:25,030 --> 00:07:31,120
digital divide I don't think that that's

00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:32,889
very arguable but there is a common

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,570
criticism of the digital divide in the

00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:40,630
United States does anybody know what

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:42,880
that is it's that it's temporary that

00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,250
it's not going to be with us forever in

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,199
the United States and in my experience

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:51,580
working with the Gussie green project I

00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,159
found that this is probably the case the

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,900
the in the Gussie green project we've

00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:59,020
had kids coming into our computer lab

00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,550
and constantly they are way way more

00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:02,169
prepared to be playing with computers

00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,780
than adults they are not scared of the

00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,250
thing right so they're going to grow up

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,960
and they're going to be comfortable with

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:10,569
technology they may not have the

00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,250
technology in their in their homes like

00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:16,569
we do but they're going to be a lot more

00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:19,780
comfortable with it then then the the

00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:23,139
current adults are but we also get the

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:25,210
adults the first class we taught at

00:08:23,139 --> 00:08:28,000
Gussie green is a community project we

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:30,339
had somebody come in and he sat down at

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,229
a computer for the first time and he

00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,719
looked down and he put his hands up and

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,950
he looked at me the keyboard was sitting

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,550
right in front of him

00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:41,260
right and he was like I had to tell him

00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,000
it's okay go ahead touch it man he it's

00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:44,410
not gonna it's not gonna hurt you and he

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,390
put his hands on the keyboard and he

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:48,940
started typing and we and we like I set

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,080
up a k-touch for him ok touches a typing

00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:52,030
program where he could practice typing

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,400
and he started doing it and you could

00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,830
sort of see the fear start to melt away

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,370
and the more that we taught him about

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:02,650
these things the more comfortably got

00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:04,060
who is willing to tell this guy hey the

00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:06,190
digital divide in the United States is

00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,600
temporary so we shouldn't worry about it

00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:10,750
I think we should I think that we have a

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,040
big opportunity to sort of get out into

00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:16,800
the community and actually start doing

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,910
these things what is this picture of a

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,440
volunteer right I'm going to loves these

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:22,150
pictures of diversity and like these the

00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:29,110
pictures of the diverse populations

00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:35,620
using Linux is it accurate one of the

00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:38,920
common linux users look like a it's a

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:41,830
it's it it's it doesn't look like this i

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,870
think i think that the we don't have a

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:46,150
quite a diverse population of linux

00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,000
users we also don't have a diverse

00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:52,030
population of IT workers how many of you

00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,100
guys work in IT right how many of you

00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:55,840
guys have a diverse population among

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,900
your workforce among your peers that you

00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,460
communicate with on a daily basis oh

00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:02,650
that's great I'm some people do but the

00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:05,320
majority of you don't I teach computer

00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:07,450
science we do not have a diverse

00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,420
population in computer science as a

00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:12,460
whole in the United States especially

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,860
not at college of charleston it doesn't

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:16,660
seem like we can get females to major in

00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,640
computer science right and this has been

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,040
a major problem for computer science and

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,070
the IT profession as a whole for quite

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:28,770
some time and and and of course why do

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,770
you think that is it does anything

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,560
that's a cert that's certainly part of

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,320
it absolutely recently there like

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,410
probably actually three weeks ago a the

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,520
Association for communicate the

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:46,250
Association for commute computing

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,660
machinery released a report where they

00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,580
had done this long term study where they

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,650
were checking to see why fun trying to

00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,080
find out why females and minorities

00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,080
don't want to go into I tbit workforce

00:10:54,080 --> 00:11:00,170
and what they found is that the major

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:02,180
motivating factors in minority and

00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:04,220
female participation in in any

00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,780
discipline is that they're drawn to

00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,170
disciplines where they have the

00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:10,700
opportunity to make some kind of that

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:14,150
work in some kind of social or

00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:17,450
interconnected way right and they do not

00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:20,060
view information technology and computer

00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:23,830
science as a discipline that will allow

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:26,120
them to do that right is that true

00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:27,770
absolutely not we're sure that's exactly

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,840
the point that we're trying to make it

00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,550
we're trying to demonstrate that you can

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,840
go you can learn about IT and then you

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,550
can go out and work in your community

00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:37,430
it's absolutely without a doubt a

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:41,570
possibility and and and the goal being

00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:43,430
that that will show the world that it's

00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:47,810
possible to change the world through IT

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:49,190
and computer science so this is that

00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:51,230
these are some of the reasons why we

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:54,320
think that what we're doing is important

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,640
this is why we do it right we've thought

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,400
a lot about it and we've been doing it

00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,870
for quite some time um but this is a

00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,480
unique opportunity to kind of address

00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,010
all these problems we can teach adults

00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,570
for workforce development right we can

00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,580
teach them basic computer skills that

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,200
they won't have otherwise we can share

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:13,970
programming skills with kids because

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:18,740
where do kids learn programming know

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,420
where the most high school I mean most K

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,700
through 12 curriculum in South Carolina

00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:29,900
what's the only computing requirement

00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:32,570
that's required typing typing is it not

00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:34,700
even office not required for comfort k

00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,530
through 12 in South Carolina typing is

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,880
it right where are they gonna learn

00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:40,160
programming well the schools aren't

00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:42,890
teaching it what I mean by the time they

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,590
get to college if they want to go and do

00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,090
something create

00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,620
her work on open source software they

00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,060
don't have their scared they've never

00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,500
done it before so they don't take the

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,390
classes and they don't major in computer

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,170
science and we see this massive decline

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,640
in our workforce we can advocate for

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,930
software freedom which is something we

00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,120
should be doing anyway I was really

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:01,590
really happy to see in the keynote today

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,230
somebody used the word evangelizing

00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:06,810
because I think that that I agree that

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,340
that that that we need to be

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,880
evangelizing for open source because

00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:13,760
nobody is going to do it for us

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:16,740
Microsoft has an army out there of

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,050
marketing people that are that are doing

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,490
so much marketing and we just don't so

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:22,650
this is another opportunity for us to

00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,180
advocate for this we can show

00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:27,780
non-techies that I t is directly related

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,370
to people by living by example by

00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,130
showing that we can go out and work in

00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:35,010
our communities and do positive things

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:36,150
leah put idle machines back to work how

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:37,530
many of you guys have a computer sitting

00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:40,770
in your closet that's not doing anything

00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:42,150
yeah I know I do too I had a lot more

00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:45,570
before I started working with free IT

00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:47,760
happens right yeah right yeah how many

00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,500
of you guys have 10 right so so those

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,910
machines could be used I mean there's

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,460
there's communities that don't have

00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,280
computers but and last but not least the

00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,830
volunteers and the the volunteers and

00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,380
and and the the organizations that we

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:03,300
help they become free software advocates

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:05,370
and that there's nothing better than

00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,590
having growing our community and

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,320
becoming and having more people become

00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:13,590
active and advocate for the things that

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,880
we believe in so free IT athens is the

00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,620
first organization that we're going to

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,690
talk about i'm going to let brian talk

00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:20,070
about this but before we do I just say a

00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,740
little bit about background Michael

00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:24,090
Moore right here Michael Moore and I and

00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,070
one other guy named Michael luck Tin

00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:27,090
we're in graduate school at they owe my

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,200
collecting wasn't but we were in

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,060
graduate school at University of Georgia

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,130
and decided you know it's having these

00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:34,290
kinds of conversations we decided hey we

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:36,690
need this kind of organization and

00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,250
Athens to help with the poverty problem

00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:39,660
urge to at least put idle machines back

00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,090
to work we had all sorts of reasons that

00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:43,710
we were doing this and so in 2005 we got

00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:48,300
together and started doing and started

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:49,710
out very slow hi but we got a lot of

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,670
work done we set up an infrastructure

00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:56,250
and it's been going to this day Michael

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,630
left i think in 2006 i left in 2007 and

00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:59,520
Brian

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:02,160
and Clint Ricker who's sitting right

00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:04,290
there and a few other folks sort of took

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,090
it over and it made it actual major

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:06,930
force in the Athens community and Brian

00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:09,390
I'll tell you a little bit more about

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:11,160
free IT yeah thanks to me so I want to

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:13,020
tell you a little bit about what free I

00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,480
key is doing right now some of our

00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:17,010
current programs kind of show you what

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,290
seems to be working in Athens and give

00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:22,290
you some ideas for what might be useful

00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,460
in your own community so so we started

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,320
giving you a bit of background we've

00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:28,980
talked about some of the motivations for

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:31,140
it so I move on and the program that

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,080
kind of underlies most of the other work

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,090
we're doing is the recycling program we

00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,320
try and recruit individuals in the

00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,480
community and businesses in the

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,940
community to when they have hardware

00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:44,490
they're no longer using maybe they've

00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,410
just bought a new computer or maybe it's

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,600
broken they don't know how to fix it to

00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:50,610
instead of taking it to the landfill to

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,160
bring it to us and that we can then

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:56,430
allow volunteers to take that computer

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,220
to bake break it apart to figure out the

00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,840
hardware what's working what isn't

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:04,080
rebuild the machine and then load it

00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:06,270
with the Ubuntu and other free and open

00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,700
source software and then they get the

00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:11,940
computer ready to be put back in the

00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:14,460
community so this program really is a

00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,320
great opportunity for volunteers who

00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:19,290
don't have a lot of experience already

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,310
with computers because the dedicated

00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:24,510
experienced staff can walk them through

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,980
working on the computer can help them

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,930
understand the hardware it can teach

00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,580
them about the software and so by

00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:32,400
volunteering they can gain a lot of

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:36,450
skills now most of this volunteer work

00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,460
takes place during our open hours open

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:40,650
hours we have them two days a week right

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:43,740
now Wednesday is from 6 to 8 p.m. and

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:45,840
sundays from wife 125 p.m. and a little

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,940
second story room at a little old school

00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:50,760
building we've been lucky to get access

00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,860
to and during these open hours our

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,540
volunteers can come in and work on

00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:56,850
processing the computers that have been

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:59,340
donated people who want to donate the

00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,080
computers can come by they can drop them

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,090
off we can give them a receipt so they

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:06,180
can get you know the tax deduction for

00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,920
making the donation and people who need

00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,750
computer help maybe there are people who

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,260
we've given computers to in the past and

00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,870
they're having

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,220
trouble with the computers or maybe you

00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:16,199
know they've got that computer with

00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:17,970
Windows they got it best buy and it's

00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,370
full of viruses and they'd like to find

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,170
a better way to use the computer we're

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,240
there with our volunteers to help them

00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:25,890
solve those problems to help them learn

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,930
how they need to do something or help

00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:31,710
them you know get open source software

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:33,570
installed on the computer now people who

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,190
want to get a computer from us there's a

00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:37,920
couple of different avenues they can

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,810
pursue one of those is by volunteering

00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,240
with us for 12 hours they can earn a

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:44,430
computer and this means essentially they

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,110
can walk in with maybe no computer

00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:48,090
experience whatsoever and at the end of

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,130
12 hours they've been able to build

00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,510
their own computer they've installed the

00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:53,190
operating system they know how the

00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,530
software works and then they can take it

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,480
home and some people who do this will

00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:59,160
just take the computer home and that'll

00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,110
be the last we'll ever hear from them

00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,670
but many other people as they're doing

00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,960
this they get excited about the work

00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,730
they're doing they get excited about

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,440
what they've learned and they want to

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,150
share that with other people and so

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,360
they'll stay on and be continuing

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:14,340
volunteers now not everyone does have

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,830
the time to volunteer and get a computer

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:20,040
that way so we do computer sales and

00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:22,620
grants for computer sales to individuals

00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:25,590
we ask fifty dollars if the computers

00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,960
being used by an adult or $25 it was

00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:29,610
going to be used by a kid that price is

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:31,530
for the complete computer system we're

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:35,250
talking a desktop that's at least

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,680
pentium 3 384 megs of ram you know 10

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,930
gig hard drive sound video network card

00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,390
the keyboard and the mouse everything

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,610
you need to have a usable system loaded

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,500
with ubuntu loaded with additional

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,240
education software and productivity

00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,850
software to make it useful for people

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,280
and so individuals can buy those

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,230
computers nonprofit groups community

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,020
groups around athens they can buy

00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:59,820
computers to or if they like they can

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,650
apply to our grant program will they'll

00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:03,840
explain to us what their information

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,130
technology needs are and how the

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,710
computers are going to help them improve

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,750
a program they offer offer a new program

00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:13,350
and then they can get free hardware if

00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,880
we approve that grant request one new

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:17,040
program was started offering is a

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,040
partnership with the school district and

00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,560
this has been really a huge for us and

00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,820
helped us really expand our impact we're

00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,250
now the athens-clarke

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:29,100
his school district there on like a 34

00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:31,110
year hardware refresh cycle so when

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,880
they're ready to replace their machines

00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:34,500
instead of just sending them to the

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,570
state surplus program will they'll

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,700
probably be bought by some wholesaler

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:41,010
and then sold on eBay or something they

00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,080
give the machines to us our volunteers

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,520
prepare them just like we prepare that

00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,410
other computers I've talked about and

00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,750
then we work with the family engagement

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,850
office at the school district to get

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,130
these computers back out to the families

00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,960
and students who need them the most or

00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:56,970
to get them to community organizations

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,160
that are doing work with kids and

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,870
after-school programs because the school

00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,940
district has a lot of information on

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,860
families they know how many kids are in

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,540
a household they know if they're on free

00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,280
or reduced lunch they can survey

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,480
families and ask them you know do you

00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,970
already have a computer in the home

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,280
already this is really helping us to

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:16,470
target the services we provide to the

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,100
population and athens that needs to help

00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:24,000
the most and the final main project we

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,880
work on is training courses really if

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,740
you hand people a computer yeah in some

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,140
aspects you've bridge the divide

00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:32,820
assuming they know how to turn it on but

00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,590
maybe they want unless you provide the

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,870
training on how to set up the hardware

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:39,450
and how to use the software giving

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,310
someone a computer is not that useful so

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,810
whenever we're distributing computers we

00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,850
make sure people go through a basic

00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:46,440
training course where they understand

00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:48,570
how the hardware works and how to take

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,310
care of the computer where we walk them

00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,930
through setting up that initial user

00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,900
account so you know we don't get a phone

00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:56,490
call saying hey I forgot my password so

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,370
they understand how to do things like

00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,650
start open office and save a file in

00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,210
Microsoft format to their jump drive so

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:08,730
maybe they can take it to work and print

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:11,460
it out just to try and put some numbers

00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:14,040
on some of the work we're doing since we

00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:16,590
moved into our new space in January

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,270
we've had over thirty five volunteers

00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,350
active and they [ __ ] logged more than

00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:25,410
500 volunteer hours since free IT was

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:27,150
started four years ago we've helped 24

00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,740
community organizations by giving them

00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,570
computers and giving them training and

00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,240
tech support in fact we've distributed

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,640
almost 200 computers to organizations

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,590
and for individuals we've distributed

00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,200
more than a thousand computer

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:42,900
is in in the past nine months I think

00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,419
we've done around 1100 computers from

00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:47,789
the school district bulk of those going

00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,500
to families with more than one child who

00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,570
didn't already have a computer in the

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:53,370
home and we've really expanded the

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,380
training programs recently in the last

00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:57,000
month and we've been doing a lot of

00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,130
these laptop distributions with the

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,720
school district we've taught 19

00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:05,340
different training courses and we're

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:07,650
looking to do even more so talking about

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:10,440
the future and we're free IT is going

00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,360
one thing is we do want to develop much

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,090
more training right now we're only doing

00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,100
the basic quiz where people understand

00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:18,450
how to click around and a boon to and

00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,580
they understand how to hook up the

00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:21,840
computer and use the mouse but we want

00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,549
to make sure they're able to use the

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,470
computer it's the fullest potential we

00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:27,870
want to make sure they understand how to

00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:29,669
grow on craigslist and search for jobs

00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,440
but not fall for the scams we want to

00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:33,240
make sure they understand how to use

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,240
openoffice and how to design their

00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,990
resume and so we're trying to develop

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,909
new courses teach more focus skills and

00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:44,340
open them up to the public who wants to

00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:46,260
come to courses and open them up to

00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,850
organizations where their staff might

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,029
need help building certain skills using

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:53,730
the free software another area we're

00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:56,340
expanding into is offering network

00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,100
access to people the internet is such a

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:00,750
crucial Avenue for gaining information

00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:02,580
and for making your voice heard in

00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,830
today's society that if we're

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:06,990
distributing a thousand computers but

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,700
all they can do is type their paper all

00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,500
they can do is maybe play G can pre if

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,289
they can't access the information online

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,880
if parents can't go to say the school

00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:16,740
district's website and look up their

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,179
kids grades they're not able to use

00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:19,620
these computers to the full potential

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,409
they're not you know true digital

00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,690
citizens so what we're trying to do

00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,340
right now is work more with different

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,399
community centers and community groups

00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:31,409
around Athens to build community hubs

00:23:29,399 --> 00:23:33,299
where people can know they can take

00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:36,149
their computer and they'll be able to

00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:38,159
get online at this site and ideally

00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:40,710
long-term we want to roll out not just

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,169
to targeted community centers but to

00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,809
work with groups and be able to roll out

00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:49,890
wireless access to entire housing

00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:51,090
communities and to do this we're going

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:53,580
to need me

00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,320
more partnerships with other

00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:57,780
organizations you know our biggest

00:23:55,320 --> 00:24:00,810
successes come when we find other groups

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:02,430
like the school district who want to do

00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:05,190
work in this area that we're working in

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,170
and can connect with us and we can have

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:09,060
a mutually beneficial relationship so

00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:10,890
working with the school district has

00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,540
been very helpful but now we're really

00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:15,660
looking at working with groups like the

00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:18,570
housing authority and the libraries to

00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:21,030
help provide computers and training to

00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,860
you know their populations and to draw

00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,870
on the skills that their workers have

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,940
and you know get help developing these

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:29,880
training courses for instance you get

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,420
help you know deploying Wi-Fi networks

00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,280
in a housing project perhaps and finally

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:38,120
the last long term goal we're probably

00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:41,340
working on is becoming our own

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,260
independent 501c3 right now we're

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,720
operating under the umbrella of another

00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,610
group in Athens that's in a sense kind

00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,080
of an incubator for nonprofit groups

00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,540
that will take care of the financial

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,330
work for us in the taxes and let us use

00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:55,890
their 501c3 status but we know that if

00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,110
we really want to keep growing and be

00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,940
seen as a little true legitimate

00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:02,640
organization that people are going to

00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,190
want us to be our own 501c3 and that

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,600
that might help us apply for grant

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,820
funding which might open up new

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,470
opportunities of bringing on you know

00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,210
perhaps in part time staff to handle

00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,940
some of the organizational work because

00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,220
right now we're all volunteers and might

00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,960
help us you know get an expanded space

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,610
so that we could accommodate more

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,520
volunteers working at once and have

00:25:20,610 --> 00:25:24,990
better computer storage so that's what

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:31,160
we're working on in the direction we're

00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:35,010
moving in thanks Brian that's great good

00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,210
so so free IT athens is pretty

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:38,700
established now it's been around for

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:40,440
about four years free linux pcs has been

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,120
around for about two years I just

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,940
recently became involved with free Linux

00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,130
PC and I'm working on the board of

00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:50,970
directors now to try to carve out a

00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:52,740
unique path for this organization but

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,500
basically the idea was that it was

00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:58,350
started in and I think too late two

00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,260
thousand six with kind of the same goal

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:02,940
in mind as free IT athens to provide

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:04,200
computer access and technology training

00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:07,559
for low-income

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,840
and individuals since that time they

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:11,760
there they've had numerous successes as

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:14,039
far as building community labs doing

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,860
some training and offering technology

00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,080
assistance but the key thing I think

00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,679
that that's changed over time with with

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,409
free Linux PC is that the initial goal

00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:27,120
was to take old computers put

00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:29,250
open-source software on them and then

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:31,409
hand them to people that would need

00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:33,299
computers as Bryan stated that that

00:26:31,409 --> 00:26:35,039
model tends to not work very well

00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:36,779
because when you just hand a computer to

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,179
somebody without providing training

00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:42,389
there's there's some difficulty and

00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:45,029
actually them knowing what to do with it

00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:47,909
it goes home and it collects dust so

00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:49,799
with that in mind free Linux pcs new

00:26:47,909 --> 00:26:52,460
goal is to start working on building

00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,529
community community computer labs

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,090
preferably across the southeast

00:26:54,529 --> 00:27:00,149
particularly in rural areas south

00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,919
carolina is has a ton of rural areas

00:27:00,149 --> 00:27:03,750
where where it's just absolutely

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,539
necessary that the community has some

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:10,080
location to go to use the internet right

00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:11,700
so the in the long term i guess free

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,049
linux pc is going to is going to move

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,399
back into the idea of giving the

00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:16,320
computers away but after they've

00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:20,549
participated in these community computer

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,830
labs but today the there's been they've

00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:26,220
gone away approximately 100 free linux

00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:28,350
pcs they and they've built three four FL

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,360
PC labs and low-income daycare centers

00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:32,370
that are all running a boom shoe with

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,309
bookmarks already set up on the internet

00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:39,179
for for websites that kids would

00:27:35,309 --> 00:27:40,769
typically visit and they've also done

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,510
some work with the sterling community

00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:46,380
center where they're actually have built

00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:47,399
a a boon to lab running thin client so

00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,710
they have a central server and they're

00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:53,159
running thin clients and it's a it's

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,169
going very very well the future though

00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,309
it's times going on one of the things

00:27:55,169 --> 00:27:57,539
that we're looking at doing with free

00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:59,789
Linux PC and we've already kind of set

00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,580
us up is to let free Linux PC kind of be

00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:05,220
a glue for all these organizations that

00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:07,830
are cropping up all over the country not

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:10,950
just the southeast so for instance free

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:13,080
IT athens has a ton of knowledge to

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:15,090
share about their experiences we made

00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,710
rookie mistakes at the beginning free

00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:17,420
Linux PC made rookie mistakes at the

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,860
beginning everybody

00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:20,480
is going to do that but the goal is to

00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:22,340
try to minimize these mistakes across

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,890
the board by sharing what's happened

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,450
right by keeping track of how things are

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:28,910
going to let people know about our

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:31,790
failure so they don't repeat them right

00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:35,270
so in it with that in mind we've set up

00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:36,710
this website free Linux PC org where the

00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,590
goal is of course to learn share and

00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:42,050
connect and basically it's about getting

00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:45,020
open source software into the community

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:48,500
however we can write and so we've got a

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,450
wiki available we've set up a well Brian

00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,530
actually set up the the open Technology

00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,060
list which I'll tell you about in a

00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:55,070
second and we're trying to sort of

00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:56,780
coordinate our efforts to some extent we

00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:58,370
do not want to be an organization that

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:00,200
tells everybody else what they have to

00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,670
do we want to be an organization that

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:03,830
just like connects a lot of these

00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,870
organizations for the reasons that I

00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:07,640
said we have a wiki set up now and

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,660
that's something that anybody has access

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,430
to so if you're interested in doing this

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:13,730
we can talk to you about it afterwards

00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:15,590
so the gusty green Community Technology

00:29:13,730 --> 00:29:19,190
Center and I misspelled green it's

00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:20,600
actually GRE E and E but the grassy

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,640
green Community Technology Center is

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,170
another project going on in South

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,170
Carolina that we're really happy about

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:29,720
and again is a much it has its own its

00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:31,250
own identity it's sort of a different

00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,960
way of doing things than any of the

00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,390
other projects that I've mentioned so

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,030
far but it's so far it's one of the more

00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:40,340
top-down projects so i think that free

00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:42,560
linux pc is very grassroots and and and

00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:45,320
free IT happens is very grassroots but

00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:47,090
one of the great things about the Gussie

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:50,720
green project is we have a lot of

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:52,010
collaborators that are already pretty

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,600
established and have been able to

00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:55,820
provide resources that so that we can

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,200
get a lot done very quickly the first

00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,630
thing is that it's in North Charleston

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,520
South Carolina does anybody ever visited

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:03,650
North Charleston on vacation no good

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:07,550
excellent lots of you yes north

00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:09,260
charleston south carolina for population

00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:11,300
density of about ten or 50,000 it's

00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,870
ranked number 10 for violent crime in

00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:17,510
the country so it there's a serious

00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:19,520
poverty problem and it leads to violent

00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:22,250
crime in North Charleston South Carolina

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:25,340
the Chicora Cherokee neighborhood is a

00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,050
particularly bad neighborhood in the

00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,970
I shouldn't have used the word bad but

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:32,090
it's a certainly economically challenged

00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:34,520
the but one of the neat things about

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,960
identifying Chicora Cherokee was Harry

00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,430
Christie at Clemson extension and I'll

00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:41,720
talk a little bit more about about him

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:43,520
in a second uh they actually used a some

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,440
kind of high-tech GPS thing

00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,550
cross-referencing with a lot of data

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,370
about about locations and asked a

00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:54,110
computer you know what what location in

00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,180
South Carolina would be best to start a

00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:58,940
project like this inchicore Cherokee

00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:00,170
came up like that they have a median

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,730
income that this neighborhood has a

00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:04,370
median income of less than twenty

00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:05,870
thousand dollars a year their their

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:07,550
grocery store they had a grocery schnee

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,660
bourhood grocery store closed because of

00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:13,160
violent crime the-the-the they had a

00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,180
farmers market so that people could get

00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:20,440
fresh food after the the after the the

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:22,700
the grocery store closed it's gone now

00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,140
the only place for people to buy food in

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,180
this neighborhood is at the 7-eleven

00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:29,030
that means that there's either they're

00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:31,310
getting poor on nutritious food for

00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:33,550
highly inflated prices that's why we

00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:38,300
typically don't buy food at gas stations

00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:39,470
but the the point is is that this is an

00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,240
economically challenged neighborhood

00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:43,820
that is trying to turn itself around

00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,070
they're actually working toward toward

00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:47,810
creating new opportunities in the area

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,150
they've had marches against violence at

00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,800
violent crime all of these things and so

00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,720
it seemed like an ideal location for

00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,370
this this project and Harry Chrissy

00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,900
found it so the north city of north

00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,810
charleston actually owns the building

00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:02,660
and it's a community center and

00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:06,020
particularly kids come in a lot after

00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,550
school to find things to do so they the

00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,500
north charles city of north strawson

00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:11,420
agreed to fund somebody to sit at that

00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,190
lab four nights a week so they're

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,050
actually there's a paid person sitting

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,260
at the lab if we set it up so that was

00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:19,580
the first resource that we had um

00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:22,340
comcast business class or Clemson

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,780
extension so Clemson extension is a part

00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:26,690
of Clemson University and Harry Christie

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,820
works for them and they are the ones

00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,990
that kind of launch this project Comcast

00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:32,870
offered to give us a year of free

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:35,000
internet at the location right so and

00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,860
after a year they're going to reevaluate

00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,710
the situation if we're doing what we

00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,990
said that we were

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,690
going to do they are planning to extend

00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:45,149
it which is great so comcast is involved

00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,470
Clemson is involved the College of

00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:49,770
Charleston computer science that's so

00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:51,990
that's where I work and I'm involved and

00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:53,399
the goal here is to get students from

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,620
the College of Charleston to work on

00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:58,799
computer literacy materials to actually

00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,010
get students engaged in the community

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:03,210
through their coursework instead of

00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:04,950
staying on campus all day actually

00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:09,360
working with the community in substance

00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:10,649
and of course the entire project would

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,970
not be possible without the Charleston

00:33:10,649 --> 00:33:13,169
South Carolina linux users group and

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:18,419
there's lots of folks in the audience

00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:20,520
right now so yeah it's all some linux

00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,140
users group that's not all of us right

00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:25,980
there there's just it's just a few of us

00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:28,679
but the but we've really and I say we

00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:31,049
they've really stepped up and taken

00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,940
charge of the of the the technical

00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,250
aspects of the lab and really worked

00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:37,649
hard they had we had it up and running

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:39,539
and if within a few months it was ready

00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:42,990
to go we're already having classes there

00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:45,539
the all the machines are working the

00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:47,130
linux users group is also regularly

00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,720
attending the classes so Harry Christie

00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,279
of Clemson extension is developing some

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,710
course materials but members of the

00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:54,299
linux users group are always at the lab

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,580
during classes helping out people

00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:00,450
individually it's really an amazing

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:02,010
thing to see um the the technical

00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:03,570
details of the lab it's just 10 machines

00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,220
running a booty with a central server

00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,409
the City of North Charleston required us

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,339
to put filtering software so we have a

00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:11,609
central server that's running

00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:13,770
dansguardian and it's also a proxy so

00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:15,450
that everything that's coming through

00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:17,129
there is filtered there's there's

00:34:15,450 --> 00:34:18,330
nothing questionable that people are

00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:22,080
looking at in the city of North

00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:24,030
Charleston's happy and of course the

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,250
class is uh so Harry Chrissy and in this

00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,889
you can see zinc o clock oh and and the

00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,480
picture as well helping out the the

00:34:28,889 --> 00:34:35,639
classes that we're doing right now our

00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,619
typing resume we did a we tried an Excel

00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:39,839
spreadsheet to set up a budget for

00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:42,119
people and people are learning their

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,070
their typing faster than they were when

00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,480
they got there there they're not scared

00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,609
like I said there was a guy that came in

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,260
the first day his hands are up like this

00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:51,160
and he was afraid to touch the keyboard

00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,170
but he's a

00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:55,870
I mean it's really going well we're

00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:57,640
seeing some impact happening it's still

00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,230
very early I mean we have been having a

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,900
cost for about three or four weeks but

00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:03,610
it's it's going it's going great I mean

00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,170
it's really a great project and i think

00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,670
that there's a lot of opportunity to

00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:12,460
sort of continue it so that means that

00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:14,020
those are three projects that that all

00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:17,470
have very different characteristics

00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:19,990
right the what we'd like to do is we'd

00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:21,460
like to see all the local linux users

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:23,080
groups or the people that are involved

00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:24,430
to try to do something like this if they

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,810
can if you have the time and you're

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:26,980
interested in the inclination if you're

00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:30,820
here I'm guessing that you have some

00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:32,350
interest in this so um there's there's a

00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,550
lot of questions that immediately come

00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:35,950
up that we thought we could just kind of

00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,330
zoom through real quick as far as what

00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,440
it takes to actually get something like

00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:43,450
this working hardware check your closets

00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,790
that's that's that's an easy easy way to

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:48,310
get started right if you can't get

00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,700
enough then start calling the local

00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:53,710
schools and seeing what you can find

00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,600
barnwell Elementary in South Carolina

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,370
has recently got in touch with me and

00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,890
told me that they have about 30

00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:01,990
computers that that that are just

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,960
sitting in rooms with nothing to do with

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:06,640
them right so so we have there's

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,100
hardware there the hardware is not hard

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:11,520
to find financial support do you want to

00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:14,740
talk about free IT athens and finances

00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:17,290
financial support don't worry about it

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:19,150
the key is not to raise money the key is

00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,460
to partner with the groups that already

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,250
have the resources to help you out at a

00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,600
free ikea athens i'm guessing we

00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,400
probably still have a couple thousand

00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,050
dollars in the bank because we do raise

00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,660
some money from the hardware sales and

00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,550
we very rarely spend money maybe we'll

00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,160
buy some shelving maybe running low on

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,720
ram will buy some but we've really found

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,730
that you know for the four years we've

00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:42,280
been operating if you can partner with

00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:44,920
the right groups run a lab in exchange

00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:48,670
for space is how we're getting our space

00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,230
for instance then you don't need to

00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:51,610
worry about the money the important

00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,310
things to focus on getting the

00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:58,390
volunteers getting time that's the

00:36:54,310 --> 00:37:00,850
resource that matters administrating an

00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,470
organization like free athens is a very

00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,570
complex endeavor although it doesn't

00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,760
sound like it would be

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,470
but you have lots of people involved and

00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,330
people are Li constantly leaving which

00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,620
means that you've got different people

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,660
that are sort of in charge at different

00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,190
times I think the key administrative

00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,530
thing that you need to do to get started

00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:19,750
is to find at least three people that

00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,820
are interested in this project and make

00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,650
decisions unanimously we didn't have any

00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:25,810
problem doing that when we started yeah

00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:28,960
that I mean the the decisions need to be

00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,030
discussed in really rational ways and

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,740
and and and and and you know it's okay

00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,960
to disagree but then you've got to make

00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:36,490
a decision as a group right and and

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,350
that's that we were able to do that

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,090
early on things changed we tried

00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:42,310
different things as time went on Michael

00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:43,870
Moore and Michael lectin left after a

00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,330
few months and I sort of was left in

00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:48,490
charge which I was never completely

00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,890
comfortable with but I made do I think

00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:52,360
in the we tried having different people

00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:53,650
have different roles like with different

00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,610
titles right we had a volunteer

00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:56,860
coordinator and all of these other

00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:58,690
things that was extremely difficult

00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:01,420
right because then you get problems with

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,680
the the recycling coordinator has an

00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:04,120
opinion on how volunteers should be

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,490
handled and the volunteer coordinator

00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:08,110
says something like what your the

00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:10,060
recycling coordinator what are we should

00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:12,040
be listening when the things were just

00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:13,660
made arbitrarily to begin with so you

00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,800
know these are these are the kind of

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,510
issues that come up in these sort of

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,860
situations so it's best to have a flat

00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:20,110
organization where everybody's got the

00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,510
same say where maybe three people are

00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:24,220
making unanimous decisions but that

00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:25,690
everybody is sort of equal right and

00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,430
that makes it easy to get these things

00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:29,590
launched maybe as time goes on you'll

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,110
need to change free ITI things now has

00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:34,480
how many members are on the board [ __ ]

00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:36,040
board of directors with five members and

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,020
we try and make sure there's always one

00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:39,580
really active volunteer on the board and

00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,830
then we've always got at least one

00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:43,360
person who's a student at UGA right now

00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:45,340
we've got a computer science student on

00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:48,400
the board try and make sure that you get

00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:50,140
a broad range of input but really even

00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,520
though we have a board of directors the

00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,990
board meetings are essentially just

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,630
staff meetings everyone gets together

00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:57,160
has a list of items they want to talk

00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,230
about we go around the room basically

00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:02,320
risa consensus on each issue before

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,960
moving on it works great yeah absolutely

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,210
the in the the edges of course there's

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,270
educational challenges we do not know

00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:13,600
how people learn to use computers right

00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,640
especially if we are not from this group

00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,549
that hasn't grown up with them I mean at

00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,989
least it

00:39:16,549 --> 00:39:20,599
right i grew up with a computer in the

00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:22,429
house so it's it's difficult for us to

00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:23,959
put ourselves in shoot in the shoes of

00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:27,199
somebody that's never used a computer

00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:28,579
before but but i think that this can be

00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,929
overcome and we haven't quite figured it

00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,549
out yet but i'd imagine that if we

00:39:29,929 --> 00:39:33,019
started partnering with people that know

00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:35,089
a little bit about education especially

00:39:33,019 --> 00:39:36,650
education of impoverished communities

00:39:35,089 --> 00:39:37,489
then maybe we could find out something

00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,809
more this is something we haven't

00:39:37,489 --> 00:39:40,099
explored yet i'm hoping to get in touch

00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,630
with some people from some universities

00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:42,920
and education departments because i

00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,499
think this is essential we need to know

00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,079
that what we're doing is has some solid

00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:49,339
grounding in reality right the people

00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,880
actually learn the way that we're trying

00:39:49,339 --> 00:39:53,929
to teach them so opportunities well the

00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,920
first opportunity i want to tell you

00:39:53,929 --> 00:39:58,009
about cuz you're quickly running out of

00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:59,959
time is that get in touch with us right

00:39:58,009 --> 00:40:01,640
I'm happy always happy to talk about

00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:03,410
this stuff I'm always happy to answer

00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,959
questions about things that I've seen

00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,869
happen experiences I've had Brian would

00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:09,769
be more than happy as well and so given

00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:11,660
touch with us we have this open

00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:13,069
community technology google group now

00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,969
and we hope that you'll you if you're

00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:16,400
interested in this sort of thing you'll

00:40:13,969 --> 00:40:17,809
join we can have we hopefully have

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,920
discussions and share experiences you

00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:20,390
can tell us about what you're trying to

00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:22,939
do we can tell you what we think of that

00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,189
and it's okay remember it's okay to

00:40:22,939 --> 00:40:26,839
disagree but I think that the important

00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:29,179
thing is that we become engaged in this

00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:31,339
conversation as open source advocates um

00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:33,589
educational institutions there's a

00:40:31,339 --> 00:40:35,420
massive opportunity right now because

00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:38,420
there's a huge move and higher education

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,619
towards service learning right uga for

00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,969

00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,609
want to do you have students that might

00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:54,949
be interested in this you get students

00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:56,959

students have energy give them out there

00:40:56,959 --> 00:41:00,979

in allendale South Carolina which is

00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:27,380
another very rural area but it's a rural

00:41:24,259 --> 00:41:28,759
area with inner-city problems it's a but

00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,500
we're there were that's what we're

00:41:28,759 --> 00:41:31,050

barn the machines we get from barn well

00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:34,240
there's you can always sell your

00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:36,520
recycled stuff if people are donating

00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,590
old computers you can always sell them

00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,090
for scrap to recycling companies free IT

00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:41,650
had a lot of success with that not only

00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:44,310
can you sell it to them they will come

00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:46,570
out and pick it up at their own expense

00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:49,270
recycling electronics is a highly

00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:51,340
lucrative business right they will drive

00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,360
for Athens they drive from Atlanta they

00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:53,920
would bring people up they would move

00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:55,690
everything themselves like when I was

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,790
there we recycled about two tons of

00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,780
material that way with just storing it

00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,060
and then letting them come and pick it

00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,650
up they paid us like four cents a pound

00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,910
or something like that we can put you in

00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:07,240
touch with recycling companies that will

00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:09,340
do that for you um do it responsibly

00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:11,500
right yeah they're keeping them out of

00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,280
landfills or not doing anything that

00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,650
they shouldn't be doing with the

00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,420
hardware um and we're providing the

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:17,860
