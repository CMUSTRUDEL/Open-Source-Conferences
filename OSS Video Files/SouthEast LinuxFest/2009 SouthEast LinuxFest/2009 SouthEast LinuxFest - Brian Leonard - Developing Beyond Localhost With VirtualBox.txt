the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,390
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,769
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,080
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,710
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,350
southeast linux fest org hi everyone um

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,930
I work for son and I my day job is

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,789
primarily evangelizing open solaris but

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:25,140
this talk is more of a focus on

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,960
virtualbox so many of you are familiar

00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,820
with virtualbox in here most all of you

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,320
so we can just wrap up now it i will

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,930
introduce VirtualBox that I know you

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,629
like had some questions but I'm just

00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,950
curious to hear what do you use it for

00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:42,570
how are you using it today why are you

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:46,559
using VirtualBox anyone want to shout

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:48,239
out reasons to run stinking windows

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,530
because you need why do you need to run

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,180
windows your wife has an ipod so just to

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,430
yeah that's why I've heard reasons for

00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,930
stuff like that so the the folk I don't

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:02,160
know if anyone is using it specifically

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:03,420
for testing in here a couple of you okay

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,900
yeah trying out a new distribution

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,010
that's really the focus of this talk is

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:09,600
you know as a developer whatever

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,010
operating system you're using is your

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,340
development environment how can you

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:16,590
utilize VirtualBox to actually test your

00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,420
applications on other os's and so to get

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,830
into some of the power of virtual box

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,360
and then i do combine it i do i am

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,500
running open solaris if anybody has any

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,330
questions on that will be happy to

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,909
answer them i am running open solaris as

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:28,770
my base OS so you'll see some of that

00:01:26,909 --> 00:01:30,600
today i don't know how many of you are

00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,390
familiar with open solaris in here's a

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,950
couple of you Oh fair amount it should

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,140
look very familiar familiar to you if

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:41,520
you're familiar with the genome desktop

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,899
that's what we use it's so pretty much

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,310
what i already said we're going to talk

00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,060
about how you can easily develop and

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:49,380
test applications using open solaris

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,189
just a little bit about my background I

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,100
am a xxo I mean I grew up as sort of a

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,110
Java developer and son acquired the

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,380
company I was working for about 12 years

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,810
ago and over the last year I've been

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,060
working with opensolaris and I started a

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:08,390
blog i call the observatory where I sort

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,800
of document my experience with the OS

00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:13,650
all right so my first question for you

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,890
guys is who can tell me how many of you

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,000
are

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,760
bella person here let's start with that

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:24,600
question oh good okay what what does it

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:29,819
mean anybody I didn't mess about what

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,230
scoop me I didn't know so so how many of

00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,970
you are Java developers in here let me

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,920
ask you that all right so what sort of

00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,810
Java's claim to fame what's it yep right

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,940
once test every yes so Java is right

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:46,950
once here so you get teacher Java is

00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,800
write once run everywhere or wara you

00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:51,930
heard people say and so sort of concept

00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,030
behind this presentation as well you

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,170
really can't just run everywhere I mean

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,700
you're kind of silly if you just write

00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,080
an application and don't actually at

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:00,269
least test it on the other epic

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,400
operating systems that you plan to have

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,500
it run on and so you should really write

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,220
once which is true i mean there's some

00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,810
serious kickass java applications that

00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,130
literally just run on all these

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:16,110
different os's but certainly they're

00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:17,760
tested on them as well and so we're

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,090
starting off with this sort of pourcel

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,910
today who has you know he's built this

00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,940
application and you know it's like hey

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,769
it doesn't quite look or feel how I

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,440
expected it to on these other operating

00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:33,690
systems you know what's the best way to

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,570
test that and so I'm going to sort of

00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,950
talk about a little bit of web

00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,720
application development real quickly

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,250
just to set the stage and then we're

00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,680
really the bulk of the talk is on the

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:51,120
testing part using VirtualBox okay so as

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:52,590
a developer you know these logos should

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,180
look somewhat familiar to most of you

00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:56,910
these are kind of a lot of the common

00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,280
components you need there's Tomcat and

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,250
apache and mysql and then some sort of

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,600
ide and so when you get a new operating

00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,310
system how do you go grab these things

00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,670
to you sort of download them piecemeal

00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,440
and configure them to work together you

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,290
know do you spend like a day getting all

00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,600
that setup and so one of the things and

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:17,430
this is actually you know I know this is

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,900
a Linux conference and so one of the

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,430
things we distribute is what we call the

00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,099
Sun web stack and it's just it's

00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:27,630
available for both open solaris and

00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:29,040
aunts specifically Red Hat

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:30,660
I don't know why it's necessarily

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,180
limited to that maybe the way it's

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:36,810
packaged but you basically get this

00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,120
entire bundle of software one easy

00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,620
install all configured to work together

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,180
we call it the Sun web stack it's

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,350
basically you're all familiar with the

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:50,160
term lamp which is you know linux apache

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:52,740
mysql perl python in PHP and so we'd

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,250
like to use the term sort of samp which

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,470
is just the Sun you know Solaris instead

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:02,790
of Linux basically give you that same

00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:05,130
sort of capability and so the command to

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,140
install the amp stack from an open

00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,340
solaris perspective and this is where

00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,810
things sort of get a little different

00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,230
from maybe what you're used to is our

00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,360
packaging system it's just PKG install

00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,790
and then the actual package name is amp

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,830
dev and it'll actually go and depending

00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:21,510
on what you have it'll grab what's

00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:23,160
missing so if you already have Java of

00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:25,620
course it'll detect that and skip that

00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,540
piece but it could take a while I think

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,210
it's like six hundred megabytes to throw

00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:31,410
the whole chunk of stuff down there but

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,900
once you're done you sort of have this

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:36,270
the basic UI set up where you can start

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,530
and stop your servers and so on and so

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:43,140
forth and so with that let me give a

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:44,730
quick demo so this is um for those of

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,550
your developers anybody use netbeans in

00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:50,730
here the rest of you eclipse is that

00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:52,350
fair right so if you're familiar at all

00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,390
with an IDE the concept should be

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:58,350
relatively the same but what i thought i

00:05:54,390 --> 00:06:00,510
would do is one of the also concepts of

00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:02,280
this presentation is developing software

00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,260
today and i des like eclipse or netbeans

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,120
has become they've made it so easy you

00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,620
can really in a matter of minutes create

00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,020
some pretty powerful applications it's

00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,520
kind of mind-blowing and so what I

00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,860
wanted to do is well let's take that

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,480
application that runs fantastic from the

00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,520
IDE and what does it actually take to

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,400
deploy it and make it run in the real

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,840
world and so this isn't really about

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,700
developing map developing applications

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,220
but just to prove that point of how

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,720
simple it is one of the components that

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,190
was you know NetBeans was one of the

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:32,310
components installed with the web stack

00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:34,110
as well as mysql and you see here I've

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,490
gone ahead and created a database called

00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:41,270
status DB and from within the tool I can

00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,270
connect to this

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,669
and once connected it as nice features I

00:06:49,229 --> 00:06:52,680
can view it's very simple it's got two

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,270
tables that just you know the concept is

00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:58,710
my manager wanted to know what I was up

00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:02,580
to so we have you know who the the team

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:04,740
member is here so there's about five

00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:06,990
people in this table and then you know a

00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,130
table of statuses there's a foreign key

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:13,020
relationship there all right so that so

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,090
given that data that sort of data

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,919
structure exists you know create an

00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,550
application that you can use to manage

00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:22,740
that data to add new status you know add

00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,310
new employees add new statuses per month

00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,979
or whatever and so simply you know the

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,229
Ides today allow me to do something like

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,229
create a new Java desktop application

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:45,780
and will call this status it's a

00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:47,610
database application and it sees all my

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,190
database tables that I have configured

00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:52,710
so I'll select status and it found the

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:55,289
four fields in there we'll go to the

00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:57,090
next page of The Wizard it will even let

00:07:55,289 --> 00:08:01,919
me create a master-detail relationship

00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:03,389
so I can select the evangelists the stat

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,400
I'm sorry the status table using that

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:08,190
foreign key relationship and now I click

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:11,039
finish and it's going to sort of

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:14,130
generate a bunch of code here all

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,190
standard java persistence api talking to

00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:18,720
the database and again the real point of

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,180
this part of the presentation is just to

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,490
show you how easy the Ides make it today

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,960
to actually create app fully functioning

00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:29,159
application so at this point I can click

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:34,020
run and we'll see it start up here in a

00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:36,959
second there we go and you know it's

00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:38,880
pretty rudimentary but it is fully you

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,529
know create read update delete capable

00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,000
and I can select these and I see the

00:08:40,529 --> 00:08:44,000
status for that person I can create new

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,350
people delete people so on and so forth

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,850
so assuming now you know we spent some

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,040
time we've cleaned it up we've added our

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:52,050
logos toward or whatever the next step

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,880
is I'm ready to deploy it so it's it

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:57,720
launched from within NetBeans know

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,400
problem so now one way that I could

00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,870
deploy this app to my team say I wanted

00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:03,240
to my team to use it would be using a

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:05,640
technology like java web start or jnlp

00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,920
and so the idea even helps me out with

00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,990
that I can go into the properties of the

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:15,180
project and tell it that I want a web

00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,410
start this app and I assume even if

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,990
you're so for those of you that aren't

00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,840
developers you've probably come across

00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:24,540
the web start applications before now

00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,800
the jar files need to be signed and so

00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,480
I'm going to go ahead and just self sign

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,040
them for the purposes of this

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,750
presentation that I de helps with that

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:36,540
as well now when I run the app from

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,800
within NetBeans watch it'll be it'll

00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,610
behave a little bit different it will

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,470
actually it's actually now building the

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:44,820
jar files signing them so it's going to

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:47,370
take a little bit longer to do that

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,770
there's a handful of jars here but now

00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:52,530
look it's actually launching it as if

00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:54,300
you went to a browser bless you and it's

00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:57,000
downloading you know downloading the

00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,560
jars and yep asks you a do you trust

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:06,210
this publisher will go ahead and do that

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:08,040
and then it will start up okay so now

00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,280
I've gotten to a point where okay great

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,500
I've got a web star enabled application

00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,880
how do I let you guys use it assuming

00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,220
you have your laptop's open and you are

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,030
on my network what do I need to do next

00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,030
what's the next step

00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,110
to play on a web server one of the web

00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,850
servers that came with the web stack was

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,150
Apache so I have that installed as well

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:38,460
on my machine and so the other thing I

00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:40,860
did one of the sort of windows and that

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:43,440
means is favorites window it's basically

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,180
just links to wherever I want in my

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,250
system while I set up a link to the

00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,840
htdocs directory this is a patchi's

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:51,780
htdocs directory so what I'm going to do

00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:54,630
is actually just copy from my employee

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,700
status all right the dist directory or

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,130
the distribution directory has basically

00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,590
the project and you see the jnlp file

00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,820
there that's the web start file that was

00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,250
created for me so I'm going to copy

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,420
these five and the lib folder has all

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,970
the libraries I need i'm just going to

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:15,480
copy those guys and come over here and

00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:18,950
paste all right cool so with that done I

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,950
should be able to open up Firefox

00:11:23,930 --> 00:11:35,990
and we'll do make sure oh that's not a

00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:39,260
DAT patch is running okay so this is the

00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:42,170
default Apache page that lets you know

00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:48,080
it works it's effective so and then the

00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:49,700
actual was launched dot HTML okay now

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,220
this is now when I click this it's going

00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:58,730
to launch the jnlp file and hopefully

00:11:52,220 --> 00:12:00,170
load my application that's a drag so

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,080
that it didn't work that way in epping

00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:14,480
so what what am I missing here any ideas

00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:16,850
I close that Apache what yeah close

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,500
enough the so the issue is the jnlp

00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:21,110
Apache doesn't know what to do with it

00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,230
the mime type isn't configured that has

00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:28,279
and so it's not doesn't come default

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:31,880
with Apache at least not yet and so what

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,350
I'm going to do well here let me

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:43,400
actually show I'll show you a little bit

00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:45,500
of the so here's that web stack sort of

00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,360
menu that was installed and it's a

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,070
pretty basic UI but it lets me start and

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,959
stop the servers you see it's got a

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,910
little configuration for a patchy here

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,560
and then it's got this advanced

00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:56,920
configuration button what do you think

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,920
this does

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:11,610
yeah so so any I'm going to go into the

00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:11,610
etsy directory and edit my mime types

00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:27,160
and yes and um and I again to save me

00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:28,839
trying to remember what this was I pre

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,249
edit it I pre put it in here even though

00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:31,600
it is not there by default it is a

00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:34,499
problem you would go into so i will

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:38,920
uncomment this i will quit this out and

00:13:34,499 --> 00:13:41,439
then i will come back into my web stock

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:47,980
options and use the very fancy stop

00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:49,839
servers and then start the servers and

00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,249
this will basically because I changed

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,720
and it lets me know what's up and

00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:57,009
running again and so let's try this one

00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,249
more time now sometimes this takes a

00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:02,199
minute yeah that's all right let me it

00:14:00,249 --> 00:14:04,389
just took a second for its cash to

00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:07,569
refresh so it this is what I expected to

00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:10,540
happen if I hopefully if I go back now

00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:11,889
there we go so we're good and so now it

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,370
says it detects it's a java web start

00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:19,899
application let's go ahead and launch it

00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:22,629
click OK and yes this looks good and now

00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:24,429
it's going to download hopefully the jar

00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,809
files oh and there we go and we're up

00:14:24,429 --> 00:14:27,100
and running so now I feel a little bit

00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:30,519
better I've actually deployed the

00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,410
application to my web server and maybe

00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm ready for some of you to try it on

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:39,749
my team or maybe not so let's go back to

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:42,670
my presentation slides which over here

00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:45,429
ok so that's sort of the software

00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,949
development piece of you know what about

00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,899
actually before I you know inflicted on

00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:52,389
you guys what sort of testing could I do

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:54,459
to make sure you're not frustrated with

00:14:52,389 --> 00:14:55,779
my application alright so I'm going to

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,990
talk about a couple of concepts here one

00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,579
is a how many of you heard of ZFS

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,920
certainly all the opensolaris guys have

00:15:00,579 --> 00:15:04,929
it's the file system in CF essence one

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,569
of the reasons I like running on top of

00:15:04,929 --> 00:15:09,490
open solaris and I'll show you why and

00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,959
then of course virtualbox which is a big

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,699
part of this presentation so let me

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,240
start off with that for those of you

00:15:12,699 --> 00:15:15,070
that

00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:16,810
I already know what it is I'm sorry for

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:18,670
those of you that don't it essentially

00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,310
allows you to run guest operating

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:22,959
systems on top of whatever host

00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:25,660
operating system you're using and the

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,480
four primary hosts are windows open

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,399
solaris linux and mac OS if you have one

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,940
of those those are the common ones out

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,500
there why everything's shaking but and

00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:39,070
then there's virtual box and then you

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,990
can run all sorts of guests it's a great

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,700
way to try open solaris or any operating

00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,070
system you want special especially the

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,330
free ones certainly people ask me how do

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,670
you know i have windows running and a

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,200
guest how did you get that you have to

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,060
have the windows license of course you

00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,709
just can't but it's cool you could

00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,089
actually use virtualbox to run i have it

00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:56,500
running windows seven if you want to

00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:59,649
check that out because the beta has been

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,300
made freely available so just some

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:02,740
history on VirtualBox even for those of

00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:05,980
you that use it may not be aware of this

00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,390
it actually started in attack the

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,339
company that created virtual box are

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:13,149
based in Germany they initially created

00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:16,570
a were hired to port kinetics virtual pc

00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:18,550
which was a mac product microsoft hired

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:20,649
them deported to windows and then

00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:25,060
microsoft just acquired it from them and

00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:26,860
so about four or five years ago they got

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,779
a bunch of cash and so they started

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:31,149
development a virtualbox sort of a clean

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:35,079
slate they decided to open source it and

00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:36,730
then we acquired them son last year one

00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,880
of the best acquisitions i think we've

00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:41,350
made its honestly when I first I don't

00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:43,660
know who's been who's anyone been using

00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,320
VirtualBox longer before 2008 in here

00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:49,089
2007 one guy back there I had never

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:50,380
actually even heard of it before we

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:52,690
acquired them and I was familiar with

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,970
like VMware of course and parallels if

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,180
you have a Mac and I was really

00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:59,079
skeptical I thought open-source

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:01,660
virtualization software seems kind of

00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:04,030
complicated it is really solid I have

00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,069
been extremely impressed and I assume

00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:08,740
those of you that here use it are aware

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:11,410
of that and so I already listed the

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,059
platforms that are it supports you know

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,770
the desktops you can you can have a

00:17:13,059 --> 00:17:16,900
Windows desktop you can resize it just

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,370
like a regular window I can go into full

00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,410
screen mode you would never even know I

00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,030
was running I could you know load up

00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:23,620
windows and virtual box here and you

00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,839
would never know that I had open solaris

00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,450
or Linux underneath the covers and I

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,380
actually often forget

00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:31,780
that I have something underneath the

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,340
covers you can go into seamless window

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,620
mode which I don't use that often allows

00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:37,030
you to put like a Linux window right

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,890
next to a Microsoft window you can

00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,770
compare and contrast really good for

00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,530
testing look and feel the mouse

00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:45,910
seamlessly will move hopefully all of

00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,650
you that use virtualbox are where are

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,600
the guest additions that you install to

00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,280
allow the mouse integration so you can

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,200
it doesn't get stuck in the virtual

00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,080
machine you can seamlessly move in and

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,940
out of it you can copy and paste between

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,550
your host machine and your virtual

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,960
machine savestate is one of my favorite

00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:03,490
features it's like putting the machine

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,970
in a hibernation so rather than having

00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:08,590
to restart say windows every time you

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,930
want to use it you can just save it

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:12,850
state and then you that's how all mine

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:15,070
are saved will see that and the

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,660
community behind VirtualBox is very

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,420
impressive there's a slight I put up

00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,040
there at WordPress where there's all

00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:23,800
kinds of hundreds of pre-existing

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,140
machines and so if you know you wanted a

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:29,080
booty machine that's configured for you

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,910
know with a patchy and mysql you can

00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,230
find that all pre-baked you just don't

00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,880
you know it's a large download it's

00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,800
probably three or four gig but you

00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:37,960
basically just download this huge file

00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:39,550
and you set it up in virtualbox you

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:44,290
point to it and you're up and running

00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:50,650
it's very nice so quickly I'll give a

00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:52,770
virtual box demo no I don't wanna do

00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,770
that

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:06,290
okay so this is my environment I've got

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,380
what eight machines set up interestingly

00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:11,750
enough for them are open solaris and

00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,760
that's my host operating system why

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,430
would I have a virtual instance of my

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,650
base operating system and that's because

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,930
I always testing different things and

00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:22,850
for me it's an awesome testbed I don't

00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:24,680
want to someone since i'll try this

00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,110
piece of software try doing this I'll

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,580
most often if I'm skeptical do it in a

00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:30,770
virtual instance of that operating

00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,110
system and make sure it works it's also

00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:35,570
great I blow I show you my blog I blog a

00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,190
fair a bit when I do write a blog I try

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,160
to make sure it's you know will work for

00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:41,950
everybody and you know as developers or

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,410
as anybody your machines tend to get

00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:47,510
friendly to how you operate you may have

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,280
set an environment variable or a

00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:51,410
configuration setting somewhere that

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,550
allows something to work that you know

00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,900
you've probably seen this in the past

00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,790
and then it doesn't work for someone

00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,650
else using VirtualBox you can make sure

00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,880
you have a pristine version of that

00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:03,350
operating system and you know test that

00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:05,000
whatever you're doing works and a great

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,130
example of that is when you file a bug

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,960
report how many times have you filed a

00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:11,210
bug report and you get works for me as a

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,300
response and it gets closed how it

00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:17,960
pisses you off and so using I can say

00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,940
look take you know take this VM load it

00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,070
up in virtualbox do these steps it will

00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,970
fail I've recreate a repeatable

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:29,330
situation it's very nice so simply to

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:33,500
create a machine oh I didn't want to do

00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:35,060
that let's what did i do started windows

00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,660
that's fine we'll get to that you click

00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:40,180
the new button not the start button and

00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,830
you'll give your machine a name and so

00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,970
say I wanted to create you know I don't

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,250
know how many of you are surprised to

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,860
see an open solaris CD in your bag at a

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:50,630
linux conference but it is there there's

00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,190
a couple ways to try it you it is a live

00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,900
CD which most of you are familiar with

00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:55,190
so you can just boot it up and see how

00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,350
it works on your machine on the bare

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,720
metal you could also use virtualbox and

00:20:57,350 --> 00:21:01,580
run it in a virtual machine and that

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,900
would simply be something like this you

00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,900
would select your operating system

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,290
your you know your machine has so much

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,650
memory how much of that do you want to

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:17,020
allocate to the virtual machine so say

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:19,300
I'll go with the default 766 and then

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,760
again either you've downloaded a

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,260
pre-existing hard disk that has some

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,360
sort of configuration on it that you can

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,050
just point to or you're going to create

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,450
one from scratch let's do that option so

00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:33,670
it starts a little sub wizard now I have

00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,840
two choices for is basically this

00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,570
operating system is going to be in a

00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,810
single file just a single disc a single

00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:43,890
image you can design it so that image

00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:46,330
grows over time up to a certain limit

00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:49,420
dynamically expanding or you can tell it

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:51,340
up front layout 20 gigs of space for me

00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,470
for this operating system supposedly the

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,180
second option makes sense is a little

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,640
bit more performant because it never has

00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:59,530
to increase in size I've never chosen

00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,440
that option i always use the dynamically

00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,390
expanding storage the initial file is

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,490
only a couple hundred megabytes and it

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,680
will grow over time as necessary it's

00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:10,360
not like I've had hiccups like what's it

00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,750
doing its expanding its storage I've

00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:16,150
never seen that so you know I can come

00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:18,070
here and I can set this thing to you

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,170
know seventy six gigabytes it really

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:21,760
doesn't matter it's just you know be be

00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:23,500
liberal here because what you don't want

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,660
to happen is for two you know when I

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,330
first started using open solaris it was

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:30,580
in virtualbox and I had set up like 16

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:33,370
gigs or 10 gigs I don't recall but I

00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:34,870
actually made it my primary OS and it

00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:36,760
wasn't long before I ran out of this

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:43,290
space and I had to kind of figure out

00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:45,670
how to add more what was I is it of what

00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:47,740
no that's the difference between the two

00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:49,330
choices so that is not hard allocated so

00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,920
little we can go look at the file it'll

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,590
only be a couple hundred megabytes and

00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,330
it'll grow up to that as needed if you

00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:58,080
did want hard allocated there was an

00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:58,080
option to do that

00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:06,920
oh thank you probably one I don't want

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,660
to I don't want to trash okay well

00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,270
that's that's fair enough that's yeah so

00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:14,390
I did I did create new oh yeah right

00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:15,740
open solaris yes and that's fine that

00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:17,540
was pretty much that demo you create the

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,120
disk and then you go to start the

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,650
machine it'll ask you for the you know

00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,820
what do you have you have a CD do you

00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,370
have an iso file that you downloaded

00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:27,170
point me to that and it'll go ahead and

00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:39,920
start installing that software or

00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:45,620
loading the live CD yes sir could you

00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:55,040
put down like a USB Drive um yeah yeah

00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:56,330
yeah yeah of course yeah yeah you will

00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:58,690
you could you could have basically a

00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:00,920
portable virtual machine absolutely

00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,210
absolutely another cool thing and I

00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,340
assume this is in the linux world as

00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,530
well you got the portable live USB

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,940
sticks now which are kind of cool

00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:09,770
because the live CD obviously isn't

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:11,090
rideable you know you load it you can

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,190
play with it but soon as you shut it

00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:15,950
down anything you've done is lost the

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,929
USB stick however you can save files too

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:19,220
so if you had like a 16 gigabit USB

00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:22,510
stick you can have a totally portable

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,510
operating system on a USB stick

00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,400
no well let's do that for example so I

00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,890
accidentally started windows here let me

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,570
just kill this and so it gives me

00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:39,310
several options I can save the state I

00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:42,640
can just power off the machine that's

00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:44,830
like just turn off the switch and now if

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,710
we go back to virtual box here you

00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:49,600
notice that says it's powered off

00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:51,730
alright and I usually I would have had a

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,420
9th machine there I didn't create it

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:58,920
because I used a duplicate name but let

00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:04,750
me go back to my presentation briefly

00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:06,550
and I want to talk about how i use ZFS

00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:09,790
or the zettabyte file system that comes

00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:12,450
with open solaris and i could talk a

00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:16,900
whole hour about ZFS it's you know it's

00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:18,370
it's a pretty cool file system the only

00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:19,870
point I want to focus with regards to

00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:22,020
this presentation to the piece I'm going

00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:25,630
to use is this ability to take

00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:28,210
instantaneous snapshots it uses a ZFS

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,920
use as a copy on write architecture and

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,710
so what it allows me to do is take

00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,720
pictures of file systems that I've set

00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:39,280
up that are very efficient very low

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:46,060
overhead and so with that well here let

00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:48,040
me go to one more so what I found is

00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:51,220
virtual box stores all of its machines

00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:54,070
this is a graphic from the VirtualBox

00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:55,690
configuration preferences dialog and it

00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,100
just shows where my machines are stored

00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,600
that's the default location it's a

00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,140
hidden directory off my home directory

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:04,840
and so what I've gone and done is made a

00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:07,240
separate file system specifically for

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,040
virtual box and once I have a file

00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,320
system dedicated for Virtual Box I can

00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,150
take snapshots of that file system so

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,370
what this really allows me to do is I

00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:18,040
talked earlier about my virtual machines

00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:20,830
being pristine being clean not being

00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,480
affected by configuration files or even

00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:24,760
I don't even want my machines affected

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,460
by prior use so when I go in and do a

00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:30,160
lot of testing I want to be able to sort

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,720
of wipe any trace that I was ever there

00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,260
just sort of roll back to how things

00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:41,529
were at the start and so with that in

00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:43,879
mind let's sort of conclude here

00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:45,440
I'm going to shut down so you see that I

00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:46,969
have the eight virtual machines notice

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,099
windows is powered off right you just

00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:50,239
saw me kill the machine it's if I went

00:26:49,099 --> 00:26:52,369
to start it right now it would boot up

00:26:50,239 --> 00:26:58,459
from scratch so let me shut down

00:26:52,369 --> 00:27:02,809
VirtualBox and I'm just going to run a

00:26:58,459 --> 00:27:05,839
ZFS command here basically what we're

00:27:02,809 --> 00:27:07,190
seeing in this output is I want you to

00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:11,450
look at the top half of the screen and I

00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:15,440
have various snapshots of my virtual box

00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:17,479
file system and the name so the file

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,089
system is called our pool virtual box

00:27:17,479 --> 00:27:25,159
and then the snapshot is everything

00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:26,719
after the @ symbol and so I sequentially

00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:29,029
name them so that when i run this list

00:27:26,719 --> 00:27:31,129
they appear in order so clean 14 and

00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:32,690
basically as time goes on you know I've

00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:34,639
been I've had these snapshots now around

00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:36,229
for months you know things happen a new

00:27:34,639 --> 00:27:37,729
version of Java comes out or a new

00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:41,479
version of virtualbox comes out or I

00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:43,450
just upgraded my Abu to image 2904 so

00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:46,399
I'll roll back to a clean environment

00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:48,289
make the change I want and then snap a

00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,639
new image of my entire virtual box

00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:51,589
environment so that's what you're seeing

00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:53,359
there and so just the other day there

00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:54,679
was I was in the windows environment and

00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,229
it said oh there's a new version of Java

00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:01,159
available so said okay I want to capture

00:27:57,229 --> 00:28:03,079
that I roll back to a boon 2904 started

00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:05,839
up windows did the java update shut it

00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:09,679
down or put it in a safe state and then

00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:11,359
I did the snapshot of java update and so

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:14,359
with that what I can do right now is the

00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:17,109
ZFS roll back and then just give the

00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:17,109
snapshot name

00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:32,240
like that and that's done you see it's

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:37,160
pretty instant instantaneous and then

00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,350
now when we start up VirtualBox you see

00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:40,880
windows is back it's kind of a subtle

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,310
difference but Windows is back in its

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,870
save state it's sort of and if I had

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,180
created that ninth machine it would be

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,970
gone because again i rolled back to a

00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:53,840
point prior to be creating that all

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:55,760
right so let's look at Windows now say

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,230
I've let's get back to the regularly

00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,090
scheduled program of testing our

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:02,420
application so I've created this app and

00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:04,250
I want to see if it'll perform on

00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,200
Windows that was a very common use case

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,840
and so let me go ahead and start windows

00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:12,310
up and again this is coming out of save

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,310
so it's like coming out of hibernation

00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:22,460
so it'll take a second I've got three

00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,660
gigs of RAM on my laptop and that sounds

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:27,230
like a lot but when you start loading

00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,450
virtual machines gets used up quick and

00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,610
so what I've done is I've set up sort of

00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:37,520
work spaces for my desktops and so I can

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:40,990
come over here and now I can go into

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,160
full screen mode and notice that host f

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,840
that's pretty critical to remember

00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,480
because you won't be able to get out of

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,300
screen host the host key is configurable

00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,410
the default is the right control but if

00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:53,240
you go once you go to full screen mode

00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:54,770
if you don't know the key sequence to

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:56,750
get out of it you basically have to shut

00:29:54,770 --> 00:30:00,260
down the virtual machine to get back to

00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:03,320
your host OS so now if I had started you

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,580
know if you all came into Southeast Sun

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,340
expects I should have had this up this

00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:11,830
should have been my welcome screen

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:13,870
I remember that next time but um right I

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:14,679
could you would never know that I was in

00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,120
here in this you know it's pretty

00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:20,320
performant and I can start ie and it's a

00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,669
now I'm not connected to the internet

00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,409
which is why this came up and actually I

00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:25,360
should make a note I've got kind of some

00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:26,679
wacky stuff going on back here now the

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:27,760
the demonstration I'm doing with

00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:29,080
virtualbox and this is what I was

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,490
alluding to with your testing I don't

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,740
know how many of you actually do network

00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:34,960
testing we're torture box between the

00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,070
guests in the host and that's really the

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,500
point of this presentation so I can what

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,210
I actually I do need to get out of this

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,380
and come back here and I need to get my

00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:50,649
IP address so what I've done is I

00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:52,690
brought a I brought a router with me so

00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,429
that I could serve up IP addresses to my

00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:57,669
virtual machines as I start them and so

00:30:54,429 --> 00:31:03,970
my host machine is a 12 and so now if i

00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:05,080
go back to VirtualBox to windows okay so

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:07,149
the first thing you notice there's no

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,460
history in my browser right you know

00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:10,750
obviously as you work in any of these

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:13,450
browsers they kind of remember where

00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:16,299
you've been and it's a pristine copy of

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:19,000
ie I never do anything in it other than

00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:21,580
updates to the US and so hopefully I can

00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,470
hit that good I'm hitting the server on

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:29,440
opensolaris and now i can hit launch

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:31,720
plus who again that looks good and now

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,799
we can launch the app I should have

00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,799
asked do we think it's going to work

00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:39,520
it doesn't and so this is you know if I

00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,360
got all excited said team i created this

00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:45,790
app go try it out and you may be calling

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,070
me up it doesn't work it's okay we look

00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:50,310
at the details and we've got so I'm

00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:54,730
unable to load resource some temp

00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:56,530
employee status launched so obviously

00:31:54,730 --> 00:32:00,040
it's looking locally for some file

00:31:56,530 --> 00:32:06,190
actually the jnlp file and so I could

00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:10,570
come back to NetBeans close and i'm

00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:15,160
going to open up this jnlp file and sure

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:18,580
enough right here this needs to be the

00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,230
code base where where is you know

00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,640
windows is trying to read this file

00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:27,280
that's looking in temp and I actually

00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:29,770
got to give it the I changed the code

00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,200
base to that right so that was something

00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:34,870
the IDE did for me as a benefit but

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,460
actually as I need to deploy i need to

00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:40,990
change it so else just save that i

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:48,940
should be able to come back here this

00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:50,950
may take a couple clicks there it goes

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,780
alright so that looks better it's found

00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:55,930
the files it's downloading them to my

00:32:52,780 --> 00:33:04,050
machine good i got the do I trust I'll

00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:04,050
say yes yeah

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:09,310
I don't know it all many errors yet all

00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:18,490
right but I don't I don't have anything

00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:20,560
right so so right very good here see

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:24,610
you're jumping ahead but so there's a

00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:25,990
t-shirt for you so but how do I figure

00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:28,600
that out that what is that's a good

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,890
guess but honestly how would I anybody

00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:34,630
know how I'd go about figuring that out

00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:36,580
like I'm just server log files actually

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:41,590
I think I don't know if they would have

00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:44,130
any right local java client log files

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:47,110
and so that i can use is actually a

00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,580
under the control panel actually all

00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:55,690
os's have it on windows it's under the

00:33:48,580 --> 00:34:01,060
control panel there's a java control

00:33:55,690 --> 00:34:03,160
panel and it has a java console that you

00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,690
can turn on this is just kind of good

00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,920
knowledge to know whenever you're having

00:34:04,690 --> 00:34:11,080
troubles with Java so I can close this

00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,430
and so that's a change i made to my

00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,200
operating system right that is turned on

00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:15,640
forever and again i don't have to worry

00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,500
about turning it off when i'm done with

00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,570
this presentation I do my roll back and

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,400
it's back to the way it was but with

00:34:19,570 --> 00:34:23,400
that let me actually try to launch again

00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:34,190
okay we see okay good so we did have a

00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:35,450
silent exception and you are correct if

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:38,540
we went and looked through all this it

00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:45,159
is you know sequel exception blah blah

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:48,290
blah and so let me close this down and

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:51,849
go back and in this case I actually have

00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:53,599
to go into the project itself and I

00:34:51,849 --> 00:34:56,750
don't know how many of you are familiar

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,460
with the java persistence api or our top

00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,540
link or anything like that or hibernate

00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:06,920
but you see here that it is here

00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:15,349
localhost and that was definitely a

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:17,329
problem so we should do that and now

00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:19,940
that's actually part of the jar file so

00:35:17,329 --> 00:35:22,549
i need to do a build it's just that

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:24,710
single jar file will build and i need to

00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:31,790
copy it back over so now i just grabbed

00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:36,920
this delete the old one from the web

00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:44,450
server paste the new one in there we go

00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:46,990
i'll go back to windows try it again go

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,990
ahead and trust

00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:56,820
yeah so now what's the problem who

00:35:51,750 --> 00:36:01,530
remind my SQL experts in the room what's

00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,150
that yeah the root in my experience I

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,820
don't know the root user and who I'm

00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:07,800
logged in as definitely usually doesn't

00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:09,650
work over a network connection I don't

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,960
know if is there any way to make it work

00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:14,130
so again another issue sort of the IDE

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,730
just rolled with that at all work

00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:20,040
locally so let's go luckily i prepared

00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:26,220
for you guys and so i actually created a

00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:36,050
i created a user password alright one

00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:36,050
more change again we'll build

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:41,119
copy

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,410
paste okay

00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:57,880
so now we think it's going to work see

00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,590
all right we got it to work so really I

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,800
mean again this is I'm not really too

00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:13,630
specific example Java Web Start jnlp I

00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:15,580
think sort of a lot of the types of

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:38,680
common things working with any IDE yes

00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:40,360
question no so like have them turn it on

00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:45,520
afterward rather than having to restart

00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:47,080
the app and when you say can you get to

00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,330
it remotely is that we were asking her

00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,200
Kim you um yeah you can start it up and

00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:54,430
then the problem in our case so we never

00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,620
the exception occurred I think they'd

00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:06,280
have to restart the app in that case but

00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:08,560
yeah you can start it up yeah right you

00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:13,110
want to see the air until you started it

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,110
started the console did

00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,529
yeah that might be true that's a good

00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:38,369
question i don't know why what's there

00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:44,700
might be something you have to install

00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:45,779
to have that here I don't right right

00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,240
well plus I'll have an internet

00:38:45,779 --> 00:38:51,630
connection so I couldn't add it anyhow

00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:53,309
yep okay so in the interest of time and

00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,289
I want to take some questions my next

00:38:53,309 --> 00:38:58,319
step would be then to try this in a bow

00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:00,059
to and I will tell you it does work

00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:01,230
we've if you had if I was on a local

00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:03,270
network you should be able to hit my

00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:06,329
machine and load the app it should work

00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:08,940
fine now but sort of carrying this test

00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:11,160
case further what about using VirtualBox

00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,250
for sort of multi-tier deployment

00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,160
testing or say I develop on one system i

00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:21,720
deploy to another and so with that let

00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:28,200
me switch back to virtual box and see if

00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:30,029
i can get a bluetooth fired up here so

00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,099
this this little green is my available

00:39:30,029 --> 00:39:33,630
memory and then we'll see purple here

00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,059
when we jump in a swap and hopefully

00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:45,900
that won't happen this thing's really

00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:48,839
slow down no go ahead absolutely so

00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,779
VirtualBox will run on yeah leopard mac

00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:55,349
OS it'll run on all the linux

00:39:51,779 --> 00:39:58,829
distributions windows and open sleigh so

00:39:55,349 --> 00:40:05,369
the four well it's got to be intel mac

00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:06,480
it won't run on a powermac all right so

00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:09,299
i'll do the same thing I've got a blue

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:15,569
to running I can move this to my boot to

00:40:09,299 --> 00:40:18,720
desktop again I'll maximize so again you

00:40:15,569 --> 00:40:20,640
can't really tell and let me grab my P

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,799
address I should have an IP address here

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,250
yeah so what was served up for me was

00:40:22,799 --> 00:40:28,980
one dot 3 and so the other cool thing is

00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,230
I came out of a safe state now whatever

00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:33,119
sort of systems you have running our are

00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:35,990
up and running as well and so let me

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,990
start the browser here

00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:44,750
oops

00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:55,230
so one of the things I of running is the

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,880
GlassFish application server and again

00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:59,070
it's just that's localhost it's

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:06,120
available and so now let's go back to my

00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:08,760
host operating system and I can do cool

00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:13,590
things like as a developer in netbeans i

00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,000
can add let me clean this up a bit i can

00:41:13,590 --> 00:41:18,240
add additional servers that I'm dealing

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,290
with and so let me add a server and i'm

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,710
going to add another version of

00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:24,870
glassfish now this is a remote domain

00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:26,400
now this would be identical to if this

00:41:24,870 --> 00:41:29,670
was a machine in my data center

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,730
somewhere in my lab somewhere right it

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:45,270
wants to know the hostname or IP their

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:46,710
IP address so i put that in cool i got

00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,930
that little green arrow there that tells

00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,730
me that it is detected it and that it's

00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:53,580
up and running and so now at this point

00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:55,350
i can go to some projects i have and you

00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,230
know a good thing to test across

00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,610
operating systems is of course ajax is

00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,520
one of those technologies that sort of

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:04,800
seems you know very open to testing on

00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,520
different os's and so i downloaded a

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:12,510
couple sample projects from a pro ajax

00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:18,930
book and so let me change their runtime

00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:20,550
properties to actually use well i

00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,530
usually i should have named it glassfish

00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,870
a boon to but it's forgot to change the

00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:29,730
name so it's glassfish one that's okay

00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:33,350
and at this point I'm going to change

00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:33,350
this one as well so I don't forget

00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:45,050
okay so at this point when I go to run

00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:48,720
the project it's going to build it and

00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:50,250
deploy it to the remote local I mean

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,140
it's local in my laptop but as far as

00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:54,720
netbeans is concerned nope that's not

00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:57,450
what I want to do so netbeans has this

00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:05,900
concept of a main project and so let me

00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:05,900
set this as the main project thank you

00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,520
kill this one

00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:24,910
way too much going on now all right

00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:26,560
let's try this again okay there we go

00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:27,609
chapter for running and so yeah it's

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,670
going to build it and then it's going to

00:43:27,609 --> 00:43:32,710
deploy it to the copy of boo to running

00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:34,690
the server on a boon to and it should

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:49,599
launch a browser here locally pointing

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:53,710
to that any questions while this is

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:58,470
loading won't it be any second should be

00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:58,470
in hell I think it's up

00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,780
you can see my machines really starting

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:08,250
to wheeze now with these two is still

00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:09,600
windows running as well but I want I

00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:10,440
want to cut that running on purpose i

00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,740
want to i definitely want to show

00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,740
something

00:44:32,329 --> 00:44:36,750
alright so a common type of you know

00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,250
Ajax feature is auto complete and so say

00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:40,890
you wanted to compare and contrast how

00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:46,950
this looked on various operating systems

00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:48,390
you know type in a and you see you know

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:51,000
you get sort of the autocomplete thing

00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:54,030
happening now let's say let's try this

00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:55,800
on so I could copy this over to Abu to I

00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,119
could change the URL to localhost

00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,099
because that's where it's running but

00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,750
what about Windows what about from one

00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:04,099
virtual machine to another virtual

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:08,819
machine doing this testing and yikes

00:45:04,099 --> 00:45:10,890
come on baby there we go so I should be

00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:13,230
able to paste there it is so I copied

00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:17,190
from opensolaris pasted into Windows hit

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:18,240
and then a you see it looks a little

00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:20,010
different I mean not that you

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,480
necessarily care but it's if we went

00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:23,430
back to open solaris it was sort of

00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:25,380
lined up nicely it's really a Firefox

00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,410
issue it looks identical to that in a

00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:31,230
boon to but on IE it looks a little

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:40,549
different and then just one last thing

00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:40,549
to test we'll go back there we go

00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,920
three

00:45:53,819 --> 00:46:03,209
I spoke parallel prel yeah that's right

00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:15,749
oh I didn't imply didn't deploy this one

00:46:03,209 --> 00:46:21,890
okay let me it ain't gonna work no yes

00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:24,029
you see the purple there I know yeah I I

00:46:21,890 --> 00:46:25,199
was trying to avoid this so well i'm

00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:26,309
gonna go ahead and launch this this will

00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,469
take a couple of seconds because it is

00:46:26,309 --> 00:46:30,660
swapping and we have about a couple

00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:46,799
minutes left I think so do are there any

00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:49,279
questions yes the reason so the the

00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:52,890
alternative talk i could have proposed

00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:54,509
for this conference was just you know

00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:56,219
what is open solaris and go through some

00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:59,039
of those things and so what I generally

00:46:56,219 --> 00:47:01,199
focus on our ZFS is of course a big

00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:03,150
piece of that the D trace feature that

00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,160
dynamic tracing is a very cool feature

00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:08,449
of Solaris open so I mean open solaris

00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,259
is really you know the next it's the

00:47:08,449 --> 00:47:11,789
development ground for the next version

00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:15,839
is solaris and so it's got everything

00:47:11,789 --> 00:47:18,150
that solaris 10 has and then some and so

00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,769
deep the dynamic tracing the service

00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:24,329
management frameworks really nice so for

00:47:19,769 --> 00:47:26,069
managing your services and you saw a

00:47:24,329 --> 00:47:27,829
little bit of that i didn't really talk

00:47:26,069 --> 00:47:30,930
about it but when i started and stopped

00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:35,130
apache in mysql that was using the

00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:36,539
service management framework crossbow is

00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,009
a brand new feature that's in this

00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:40,049
newest version of open solaris it's a

00:47:38,009 --> 00:47:42,119
project name for a virtual networking so

00:47:40,049 --> 00:47:44,459
you can actually create virtual network

00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,440
interface cards on your machine based

00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:47,849
off your one so on a laptop like this i

00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,739
could create five virtual knicks and

00:47:47,849 --> 00:47:51,509
then I could do flow control amongst

00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:53,160
those Knicks or I could set up you know

00:47:51,509 --> 00:47:55,440
my virtual machines to point to those

00:47:53,160 --> 00:48:02,539
various network interface cards it's a

00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:02,539
really nice feature yep anything else

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:18,520
thanks

00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:19,869
there we go so quickly I've got a couple

00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,780
minutes so say you're doing something

00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:24,130
like this it's just simple but it's two

00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:27,540
effects happening at once and say you

00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:34,710
wanted to use something like that and I

00:48:27,540 --> 00:48:34,710
question is can I e handle that do I

00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:43,060
can't I always close with that of my my

00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:45,099
linux talks no one surprised but so i

00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:47,320
think i have like what a minute nothing

00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:57,310
yeah so if there any other questions if

00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:58,660
they're not i'll cut you loose yeah work

00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:09,130
over a network i haven't thought about

00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:11,080
that I just for those who don't know

00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:13,000
time slider is the future that you saw

00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,280
the snapshotting feature that I did we

00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,020
basically put a nice little user

00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:19,770
interface on top of that so for all your

00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:22,119
data we take snapshots every 15 minutes

00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,950
and we call that time slider so it's

00:49:22,119 --> 00:49:26,080
kind of equivalent to time machine in

00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:29,020
Mac OS you can go back to any point in

00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:30,820
time and I happen to show any of you a

00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:33,670
demo of that does it work over NFS

00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:36,820
though I am skeptical that it would I

00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:43,440
have to think about it I but I don't

00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:43,440
believe it would anything else

00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:51,500
about some being purchased by Oracle the

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,330
only thing I know is that they set a

00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:55,100
date for the shareholder approval

00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:58,820
meeting which is like july twenty first

00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:00,230
and so at that date I don't know how

00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,990
long it is after that assuming it's

00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:17,720
approved it a couple weeks oh yeah I

00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:20,990
don't know much yes yeah well it so this

00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,640
dia the strategy is if it is the next

00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:23,900
version of Solaris and so if you're

00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,940
looking for some of the features are

00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:28,940
going to be in Solaris dot next whatever

00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:30,260
they call it you could start deploying

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:31,760
open solaris and it will deplete you

00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:34,190
know that this release actually deploys

00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,660
on sparc now which is a new feature we

00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,520
didn't have that for the previous

00:50:35,660 --> 00:50:38,810
releases of open solaris and so you can

00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,670
start putting it in your data center

00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:42,260
they've upped the support contracts to

00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:44,810
like five years and so you can get the

00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,460
same support you can on solaris and so

00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,530
yeah it's just the roadmap to solaris

00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,570
that next and they I hope someday I can

00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:52,369
say solaris 11 but that they haven't

00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:59,320
decided what is going to be called in

00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:59,320
the back and what about network installs

00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:08,420
Yeah right oh so you're talking about

00:51:05,329 --> 00:51:10,010
jumpstart so that was one of the issues

00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,569
actually with getting it ported to spark

00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,369
there is no jumps this is one of the big

00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:16,250
changes between solaris 10 and open

00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:17,869
solaris there is no jumpstart support in

00:51:16,250 --> 00:51:19,520
open solaris they've changed it to a

00:51:17,869 --> 00:51:22,599
different technology called automated

00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:25,220
installer and so it is a network install

00:51:22,599 --> 00:51:30,290
it's similar to jumpstart it's just

00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:31,819
different but that is available now and

00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:33,500
it's actually the only way if you its

00:51:31,819 --> 00:51:35,089
kind of if you have a spark machine the

00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,619
only way to get solaris on spark is

00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:38,540
through the automated the network

00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:42,980
install there is no installer for spark

00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:45,260
at the moment we have lunch now right

00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:47,480
anyhow yeah so we're not like if there's

00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:51,260
a couple more questions I can I can take

00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:52,880
them all right to thanks all right if

00:51:51,260 --> 00:52:01,460
there's not any more than I'll cut you

00:51:52,880 --> 00:52:03,049
loose yeah I didn't put the cds in the

00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:04,910
bag i'll think of that that was it I

00:52:03,049 --> 00:52:08,420
didn't personally do that they got sent

00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:11,349
here and I won't name who did no but I

00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:12,890
find I find I found it to be you know

00:52:11,349 --> 00:52:15,980
what's the word I'm looking for

00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:16,970
aggressive or I just I think you know

00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,099
people interested in the open source

00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:20,329
technology so I i find it generally

00:52:19,099 --> 00:52:21,770
linux conferences people are receptive

00:52:20,329 --> 00:52:26,440
to hearing about open solaris what's

00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:26,440
going on yes over there

00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:35,690
yeah I don't there might be some hacks

00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:38,240
on that they're available I don't not

00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:40,280
that i am aware of i haven't seen that I

00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:42,109
don't know exactly I don't know if I I

00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:45,740
think that's a Mac licensing issue

00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:47,540
actually I don't I don't you know their

00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:49,970
OS really only runs on their hardware

00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:53,119
and as far as I know they don't want it

00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:54,350
running anywhere else yeah so that's

00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,730
really the only limitation of virtualbox

00:52:54,350 --> 00:52:58,820
if you want to test them a Mac you kind

00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:02,320
of need a mac as your host OS and then

00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,320
you have all the other os's available

00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,910
ok

00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,490
yeah none there's no plans that i know

00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:37,720
of for the mac that's important did you

00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:39,670
have another question yeah from what

00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,070
from what Oracle said they bought us for

00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:45,970
solaris in Java or the two primary

00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:49,890
things that they called out so all right

00:53:45,970 --> 00:53:52,810
all right guys well thank you very much
