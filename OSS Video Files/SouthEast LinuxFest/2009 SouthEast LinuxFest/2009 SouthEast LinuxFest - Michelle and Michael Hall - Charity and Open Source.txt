the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,359
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,740
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,049
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,400
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:20,010
southeast linux fest org I'm here to

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,390
talk to you today about how open source

00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:27,210
software can narrow the digital divide

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,859
so alright so what is this digital

00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,340
divide thing what are we talking about

00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:33,899
here it refers to the gap between those

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,020
who benefit from technology and those

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,660
who don't it includes the imbalances of

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,329
physical access to technology as well as

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:46,980
the imbalances and resources money

00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:49,710
education exposure skills we're talking

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:55,530
those of us who have and those of us who

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,930
have not go on to the next I we have

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,449
some some various statistics here in

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:02,879
2004 less than three out of every 100

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,170
africans used the internet compared with

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,490
an average of one out of two ever

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,590
inhabitants in the g8 countries the US

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,600
has more than twice as many internet

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,840
users as the remaining 42 countries in

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,000
the American region put together two out

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,400
of every three wide white students or

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,110
67% used the internet but less than half

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,909
of blacks and Hispanics do according to

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:28,320
federal data released and this is I

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:30,119
think in 2004 for Hispanics the figure

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,189
was forty-four percent for blacks it was

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,869
47 and according to a SN system 2001

00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,880
43.7 percent of u.s. households don't

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,520
have a computer when we take a look at

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,159
those statistics put together the

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,950
numbers combined lead us to believe that

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,490
technology is rare even for those of us

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,560
who have even for those of us in the g8

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,649
countries where we r developed in

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,320
developing technology is a rare resource

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:01,229
and so a large portion of our globe does

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,689
not have access for some reason to

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:09,360
technology go on so who are we and what

00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:11,250
do I have to do with this right um I'm

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,050
Michelle that's Michael we're from

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,260
lakeland florida it's a little kind of

00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,599
podunk town in between Orlando and Tampa

00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:20,640
there's the i-4 corridor there's Disney

00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:23,099
there's the beach we're smack dab in the

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,330
middle we live in one of the poorest

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:30,000
counties in Florida our school board is

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,500
drastically underfunded our average

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,050
teacher salary is twenty-three thousand

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,180
dollars a year average teacher salary

00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:38,519
that's the teachers that have the

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,220
master's degrees that have the tenure

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,989
that have the experience that they make

00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,940
an average of twenty three thousand

00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:49,830
dollars a year we are we've been married

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,420
for six years plus a little bit of

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,890
change now and we are the proud parents

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,709
of those too young and sitting over

00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,540
there um our little boy is Quinn he is

00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:00,000
five our little girls Ainsley she's

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,860
three and a half at twenty-one months

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,599
old our son Clinton was diagnosed with

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,300
pervasive developmental disorder not

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,610
otherwise specified it's about this long

00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,970
and it basically means that our sons

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,330
will your child it is what it is it is

00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,670
an autism spectrum disorder um statistic

00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,980
for you autism and autism spectrum

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,170
disorders affect one out of every 150

00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,780
children and approximately one out of

00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,730
every 96 boys chances are there's a

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,110
large group of autistics

00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,700
high-functioning autistic sand

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,890
Asperger's individuals here with us

00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:36,349
today including our son um how we kind

00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,510
of got involved in this whole

00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:41,640
open-source business at three and a half

00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:44,549
we couldn't drag Quint away from

00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,409
Michael's computer he is not an active

00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:49,739
child he does not enjoy going out and

00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:51,739
playing um he is physically

00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:54,569
uncoordinated he does not like to run

00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:56,730
he's very intelligent he would just as

00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:58,379
soon sit down with a book he's five he

00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:03,239
reads it a third to half third and a

00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:06,269
half grade level um he wanted to be on

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:09,720
Mike's computer wanted to that's where

00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,480
he wanted to be okay well we cater to

00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:15,180
him to his needs and that's one of the

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,650
things that he enjoys doing so we agreed

00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,660
to allow him computer time

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:23,180
I when he sat down to a regular computer

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:25,580
screen he had menus he had to navigate

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,310
he had icons all over the place yeah all

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:31,009
of this garbage and for him it was

00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:36,800
entirely to visually overstimulating he

00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:38,840
went back and we went no so we started

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,350
looking and we didn't find anything that

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,199
would do well we weighed a windows

00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,120
environment and while that's drunk we

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,789
looked at a standard Ubuntu based

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,650
environment and that was still more than

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:54,680
he could handle at that point he wasn't

00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:57,919
literate Michael came and he said you

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,539
know we could do this ourselves and I

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,720
said all right whatever you have fun

00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:05,389
with that um so we can we put together

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,770
this this simplified version of a bunch

00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:08,960
of everything's across the bottom in a

00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:10,039
nice little launcher so that when the

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,389
child sits down and looks at the

00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:15,860
computer there's a window or a screen he

00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,060
sits and everything that he wants us

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:21,020
across the bottom there's no reading

00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:22,699
necessary and none of that so okay we

00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,770
put this with Quinn and he thought hey

00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:26,660
this is cool then we installed it on

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,599
some secondhand computers for a daycare

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,960
and I passed a couple off to to some of

00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:34,909
our friends with small children and

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:40,760
everybody loved it and we went this is

00:05:34,909 --> 00:05:43,550
interesting after we received feedback

00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,860
from the kids Mike realized that we were

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,630
on to something kind of bright it's it

00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,130
honey um you know what would you think

00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,199
if we did this more often and I said all

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:52,490
right I did what I always do my

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,930
grandmother told me if you're going to

00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:56,479
if you're going to do something go big

00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:00,110
or go home and so we did and i found it

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:02,030
a charity 501 c 3 is pending where we're

00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:05,389
still working on getting all of that

00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:06,830
taken care of it's expensive to file we

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,260
decided that we would recycle old

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,510
computers and place them in households

00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:14,120
in our community the families would

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:17,599
either be low-income and at risk we're

00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:21,680
talking kids with incomes very minimal

00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:23,780
or children who like Quinn have special

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,190
needs those kids are often overlooked

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,539
and it's a tragedy go on let me tell you

00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,770
a little bit about some of my children

00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,150
that we've placed computers with before

00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,000
we go on

00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:38,150
we've worked with a community of migrant

00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:41,300
children in our local community we live

00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:43,460
next door to the strawberry capital of

00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:46,610
the south I don't know you've probably

00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:49,430
eaten some plant city strawberries the

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:52,460
workers that that migrated in when those

00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,480
strawberries come to season our migrant

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,120
workers they tend to be Hispanic and

00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:02,890
those households have monthly incomes of

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,810
less than two hundred dollars a month at

00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:07,130
200 there's not an extra zero there

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,330
there's no comma there's no nothing

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:11,060
we're talking two hundred dollars a

00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,950
month those families if they had wanted

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,640
to buy a computer for their children

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,560
could not have at all I was invited to

00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,970
the great American teachin I went and

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,050
spoke about what we were doing with the

00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:25,820
charity to the kids and we offered those

00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,070
children an opportunity to write a paper

00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:29,330
these were fourth grade children to

00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,400
write me a paper that said what they

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,770
wanted to be when they grew up and how

00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,680
computers could help them do that we

00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:38,240
chose 13 of those papers and gave each

00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,330
one of those children computers we've

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,060
done this for six months now we've

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:47,540
already placed I've forgotten how many

00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:53,150
computers 818 no well with the 12 from

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:55,520
crossville we're at about 30 I got one

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,890
paper back from a little girl she's a

00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,500
little Mexican girl she was the first

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:04,070
generation of her family to go to school

00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,660
at all she's in fourth grade could

00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:08,080
barely read and write English she's

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,370
learning English as a secondary language

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,170
mom and dad or migrant worker she wrote

00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:15,710
me this paper she said mrs. hall I want

00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:18,440
to be a teacher when I grow up my mommy

00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:20,150
and daddy are field workers and my

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,090
mommy's always told me that she wants me

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,610
to grow up with enough that I can have a

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:29,240
better job so that I can get out of the

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,160
field and make her proud how I could

00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:34,850
morally read that paper and not give

00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,980
that child a computer I don't know so

00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:40,250
she received one and she's well on her

00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:44,210
way my friend the teacher in that

00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,960
classroom called me a few days ago with

00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,420
the

00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:50,560
fcat scores you're probably not familiar

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,520
with the fcat it's the Florida

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:57,260
assessment test that all the kids have

00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:00,920
to take her class of children came up

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:04,250
eighteen percent this year one of that

00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,690
class of 22 did not pass that test every

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:09,850
single one of them the rest of them

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:12,470
passed I am so proud of those children

00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,730
but as we were getting started with this

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,400
we realized that we weren't the first

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:17,810
organization to use linux and open

00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,740
source to help bridge this divide

00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:23,240
between ourselves and these other kids

00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:26,870
there some you may know the Helios

00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,610
project the free geek project and even

00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,040
as we speak in the ballroom next door

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:33,110
free IT from Athens is discussing their

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,000
project they are currently trying to

00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:38,090
install a technology center in North

00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,020
Charleston South Carolina others you may

00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:43,780
not know a wall is from Atlanta and that

00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:45,950
I can't even pronounce at Cyber Club

00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:49,430
they are in the Panhandle they are

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:51,830
working with 4-h kids teaching the 4-h

00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:54,260
kids to rebuild and install and then

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,110
place those computers that those 4-h

00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,830
kids did with younger kids it's a

00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:03,440
fabulous movement and countless other

00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:05,990
individuals working one computer at a

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,390
time making an effort to change the

00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,920
lives of children there's one here

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:12,460
there's one there there's one all over

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,880
the place there's one in your community

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,930
everywhere we looked there was someone

00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,850
but how many individuals and groups

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:22,160
exist doing the same sort of work that

00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:23,810
we don't know about how can you find

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,760
someone in your area who's already doing

00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:28,280
this how can you start one in your own

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,840
community there were no resources there

00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:35,270
was no sense of community there were no

00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:37,730
common goals so being of the nature that

00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,010
I am we decided to put together that set

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,340
of resources as well and we've rolled

00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:47,060
out growing up free org it's not another

00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:49,730
charity it's not um it's not an

00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:51,950
organization it's just the gathering a

00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,870
place for charities and individuals all

00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:56,780
over the world to pass out information

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,850
to obtain resources and form connections

00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:03,620
between the open source community

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:06,949
and the community at large we are making

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:09,470
an effort to reach out growing up free

00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:11,360
as a community encourages you to find

00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:12,920
organizations that are nearest to you so

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:18,170
that you can contribute to their efforts

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:19,339
to let people who want to help or need

00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:21,829
your help find out about your

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:25,069
organization should you have one okay so

00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:27,769
you have this little org how do people

00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:29,480
find out about you mMmmm or two mouths

00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:30,920
that seems to be the way we do it but

00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,630
that's kind of silly because then you're

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:35,500
you're working with one person at a time

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:38,389
and waiting on that trickle-down effect

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,519
so here we are you know with a system in

00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,100
which you can let others find out about

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:45,620
your organization you can request for

00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,290
help you can request donations you can

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,000
say hey I have a plethora of 72 monitors

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,550
in my back shop I need somebody to take

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,170
them off my hand and the organization

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:59,089
three cities over can go hey you know

00:11:54,170 --> 00:12:01,069
what I need monitors let's coordinate we

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:02,329
can tell people about your project so

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,029
they can contribute time money or

00:12:02,329 --> 00:12:07,880
hardware you can say hey listen I am

00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:11,750
running this project i'm doing a 12-seat

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,089
computer lab in hickville tennessee and

00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,740
somebody can say hey you know what I'm

00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:18,529
around the corner let me come over and

00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,149
help you you can share your knowledge

00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,009
and experience with others and help them

00:12:20,149 --> 00:12:25,160
get started and avoid common pitfalls

00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:30,079
let me tell you it is expensive to file

00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,699
a 501c3 a paperwork system from from the

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,040
IRS in order to be able to be

00:12:31,699 --> 00:12:36,649
tax-deductible you have to have one well

00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,000
it's just the two of us I don't have a

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:42,589
spare six hundred dollars line around

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,100
wish it did it's expensive you might

00:12:42,589 --> 00:12:49,579
want to know that before you decide to

00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:54,250
run your own organization I can tell you

00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:56,720
that now why the open source community

00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,850
the digital divide isn't just about

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,579
having a computer it's about having

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,319
accessibility and knowledge having a

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,730
computer is one thing but having access

00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,370
to education and skills it's a

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,899
completely different problem open source

00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,149
software doesn't put up those obstacles

00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,560
it doesn't say okay you have to have a

00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,779
license you have to have perm

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:17,270
in order to be able to use this stuff

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:21,350
you want it it's yours here take it do

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:23,060
what you will with it those that cross

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,580
the digital divide on open source

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:28,550
software become members of our community

00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:30,080
and helping them helps us let me tell

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:34,900
you that computer over there still dual

00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:38,660
boots I still run vista sorry however I

00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,960
went from not touching this thing called

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:46,279
Linux to running an open source based

00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:49,190
charity in the span of six months talk

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:52,370
about jumping in feet first but that's

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:54,529
okay because now the community the open

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:57,910
source community is helping me and in

00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:57,910
turn i turn around help them as well

00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:05,660
have I gone on oh I have Donna growing

00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:07,810
up free is a new site there's much to be

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:10,070
done it's still sort of in its infancy

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:13,460
you take a look at it and it's still

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:16,460
kind of rough around the edges um and we

00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,890
need help we desperately need help if

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,360
you know of charities and organizations

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,130
in your community that are much doing

00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,410
the same sorts of projects please add

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:25,760
them to our wiki so that we can get in

00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:26,960
touch with them so that you can get in

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,810
touch with them so that Joe around the

00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,520
corner can get in touch with them list

00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:33,200
current and future projects if you're

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:37,280
working on a project please create a

00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:39,530
page for them so that we know um use

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,320
growing up for you to promote them yes

00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:44,570
send out a mailing perfectly fine with

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,760
that that's what it's there for create

00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,490
pages for ideas advice and references

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:52,510
hey if you have a brilliant idea our

00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,070
loco in Florida is getting ready to do a

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,310
build day where we're bringing in

00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,450
at-risk teens from the community

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:01,700
providing them with all of the hardware

00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,950
and the software and saying okay this is

00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,120
how you build it yourself this is

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,300
something that we're working together on

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,100
if you have a brilliant idea at it who

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,070
knows who might come up and say hey this

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:19,580
is a good idea let's get on it the wiki

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:21,530
is open for community contributions but

00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,130
my goal is not to promote my projects

00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:27,990
these are my pet things um

00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:29,160
we encourage you to join in and we

00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,340
encourage you to throw money in your

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,320
general direction that's that's fabulous

00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:37,230
but our goal here today is to encourage

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,510
you as individuals and organizations to

00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:41,460
give back to the community at large to

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:46,140
use open source as a means for giving

00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:48,150
back the benefits are vast not just for

00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:52,980
those that you contribute to but also

00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:54,930
for yourself we know we know you have to

00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,090
give your time we know that time is is

00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:58,890
of the essence we know that it's

00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,810
something that you may not have a lot of

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,540
believe me I'm a stay-at-home mom with

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:08,640
two little ones my free time is limited

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:10,530
but there is nothing quite like handing

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:14,340
a computer to a child who's never seen

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:16,710
one watch that child sit down behind the

00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:19,190
screen put his hand on the mouse click a

00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:22,320
button and see the lights come on

00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,060
there's nothing like realizing that

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,370
you've just opened a door for that child

00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,010
an opportunity that chances are he may

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:31,650
have never had there's nothing quite

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,800
like watching a single mom for the first

00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:37,050
time sit down at a computer and realize

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,120
that she can complete her coursework so

00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,410
that she can go back to school and that

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,760
she can better the lives of her children

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:47,310
I watched one mom ball when I handed her

00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:51,660
a computer I couldn't have done this

00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:56,490
without you thank you so much I don't

00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:58,920
know what to say I cried too but there's

00:16:56,490 --> 00:17:01,890
nothing like that and you know the time

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,829
and resources that I spent in order to

00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:10,260
give that to her we're absolutely worth

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:15,089
it I don't even know what he's going on

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:18,420
about over there you go on as we make an

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:19,650
effort to close the digital divide we

00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,470
also make our presence in the community

00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:24,750
stronger as an open source community

00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:28,020
this is beneficial to us because as I

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:30,630
hand a computer equipped with

00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:32,400
open-source software to a mother who

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,429
couldn't have otherwise afford a

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,010
computer when she speaks to her friend

00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:40,260
at school or at work

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:42,000
she's going to say hey listen you know I

00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,450
have this computer it didn't cost me

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,880
anything I can get this software you can

00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:50,190
use it at home too and it doesn't cost

00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,000
you anything either and so she hears

00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:56,160
about openoffice and so she talks to the

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,320
next one and she talks in she talks and

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,920
she talks and she talks and suddenly we

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,770
have an influx of women or gentlemen or

00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:06,210
children as they come up that wouldn't

00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,700
have otherwise heard about open source

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,390
software that are now contributing back

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,900
to our community it is our firm belief

00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:18,390
that as we grow as a charitable resource

00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,060
we will promote open source software in

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:23,370
the community at large and thus

00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,500
encouraged the development of that open

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:33,870
source software they'll give back to us

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:36,090
because we gave to them below hello this

00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:39,150
is our vision this is this is why we do

00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,940
what we do um we dream of a world in

00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,520
which a child does not have want of a

00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,470
computer a world in which money

00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,810
education and resources are not a factor

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,300
for child's ability to have access to

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:53,130
technology we believe the every child

00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,540
regardless of circumstance or disability

00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:57,060
should have access to computer

00:18:54,540 --> 00:19:00,060
technology we know that this is a lofty

00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:02,400
goal and we strive to contribute as much

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:08,760
as possible to that drain we hope that

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:12,600
you'll join us however you feel fit in

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:16,070
whatever circumstances you can um every

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:22,740
child that we help is a life changed

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:24,390
every wire cross was my shoulder um who

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,380
knows what these kids will grow up to be

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:29,640
that little girl the one who told me

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,800
that she wanted to get out of the fields

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:37,170
wants to be a teacher she can grow it to

00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,440
be a teacher she can grow up to teach

00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:43,620
the next Einstein she can grow up to

00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,720
teach the next Stephen Hawking one of

00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:47,280
those kids may be the next Einstein or

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,290
the next president of the United States

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:51,380
I had one little boy tell me that he

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,480
wanted to be a new present or the next

00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:57,380
because he was black like like like

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:59,060
President Obama and that he hoped that

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:02,000
using a computer that we gave him would

00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:04,910
help him accomplish that dream he might

00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,010
well be that's why we do what we do

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,260
that's why we contribute in our

00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:12,920
community we encourage you to do the

00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:16,700
same if you don't know where to start

00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,780
holler yeah hey you up there I don't

00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,510

do okay well I'll help you with that you

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,500
don't know what software to give a kid

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:28,160
well um we have a customized distro for

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:31,460
you to start with some of you may have

00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:34,880
heard of chem oh we put that together

00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:38,180
for our little boy we're certainly

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:41,180
willing to help we encourage you to to

00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:43,640
go out into your communities to talk to

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:48,160
speak with each other to form

00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:51,650
connections and to make an attempt to

00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:54,440
change the lives of kids change the

00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:57,320
lives of those in your community change

00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:58,670
the lives of the world at large and see

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:03,080
what we can accomplish through open

00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:05,690
source and now i think i have absolutely

00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:09,440
sped through my presentation so um i'd

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:11,510
like to maybe do sort of an open forum

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,600
sort of thing if you have questions or

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,040
comments um you know don't beat each

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:20,390
other over the heads with a baseball bat

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:23,260
to get in line but certainly raise them

00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,260
in the back

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,480
here

00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,880
two

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,880
I

00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:58,290
in regards camo let me kind of go back

00:22:56,790 --> 00:23:01,050
and revisit Kim a little bit since we

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:03,240
didn't really discuss come up with

00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:05,640
something that we designed so that we

00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,250
can put a distro on really old hardware

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:11,760
we've been putting it out on on 400

00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:14,850
megahertz processors to send into into

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:16,350
homes there's there's a plethora of old

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,110
hardware sitting around going to the

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,850
dump that that needs that something

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:24,810
needs to be done with it doesn't need to

00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:28,230
go and sit and and destroy our ecosystem

00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:29,820
at the same time you know it's an

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,460
opportunity waiting to happen for these

00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,650
children it's a district that's really

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,960
like designed to be something that we

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,610
can use to recycle old hardware and put

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,720
out into whatever sort of community you

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:47,100
should want to we designed kimmo quickly

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,440
we designed it with just the two of us

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:54,540
he's the brains of the operation I'm

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,160
just the one that's the promoter and so

00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:58,920
there are some things that we want to do

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,520
we don't have an internet filter on it

00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:04,320
at this point that's coming there are

00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,670
some other sort of customizations that

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,760
we want to do that we just haven't had

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:11,280
the time for he has to work a full-time

00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,890
job and so when he comes home at night

00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,320
it's it's bath time it's dinner time

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:18,480
it's bedtime for the little ones and by

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,250
the time we get all of that done we're

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,990
looking at you know seven thirty eight

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:24,300
o'clock nine o'clock by the time we eat

00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:25,470
dinner oh hey it's ten o'clock and time

00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,630
to go to bed and start the day over

00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:29,280
again and some maintenance has been

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:33,420
something that has been lagging and

00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:36,000
we're aware it's on the to-do list what

00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:37,890
can i say my to-do list is 47 miles long

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,440
at this point so let you know we are

00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,429
planning on including an internet filter

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,649
in the next version of

00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:46,749
kimmo we also still provide a lot of

00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:49,809
programs that adults can use like a

00:24:46,749 --> 00:24:51,669
b-word when we set these computers up

00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:53,740
that we're giving out we set up to you

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:56,379
sir examples one kid the one for the

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,450
cameras so we have tried to include as

00:24:56,379 --> 00:25:01,659
many of those as possible we've been

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:04,869
restricted by the CD size we want

00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:06,879
everything to be run on a single CD so

00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:16,629
we've had to strip out a few things to

00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:18,730
make that happen we're also planning on

00:25:16,629 --> 00:25:21,159
doing an alternative install CD in the

00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,559
next version so if you have a computer

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:25,899
with less than the minimum amount of

00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:28,360
grams needed to run a live CD you can

00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:31,749
still install them that's also like you

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,600
said on the to-do list um any other

00:25:31,749 --> 00:25:45,549
questions I saw some other hand so don't

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:51,360
be shy Qi em up my email should you want

00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:51,360
it is nichelle at the number for kids

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,700
school

00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:14,520
just give much they say they're trying

00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:17,220
out there grunting what because in the

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:21,900
last three weeks hang up rest of us

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:23,470
doors and rocks by powers to start

00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,960
building something

00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:30,390
and I can just take it to the recycle

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,390
place to essentially fool

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:49,570
we have a large workshop in our backyard

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,180
we don't have basements in Florida for

00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:53,500
things under the ground is underwater

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,540
but we have a large workshop where

00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,370
everything gets poured it away and yes I

00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,050
have been keeping everything that comes

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,940
in that's why we're trying to do

00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,270
grown-up free so that you can go on to

00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:06,310
the forums and say hey listen I've got

00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,680
six motherboards I need power supplies

00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,930
and Joe Schmo down the street just

00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,270
happened to happen and his wife is

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,730
meeting and it about getting rid of them

00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:17,590
yeah he can say oh hey you know I can

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:21,760
give them to you and then together we

00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:24,730
can we can give these to these kids we

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:32,350
are from Lakeland right smack dab in the

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:34,840
middle it will have it in Tampa which is

00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:36,160
about a 20 minute drive for us but it

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:39,640
puts us in a little bit larger city

00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:41,770
where we have more accessibility where

00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,040
we can get more more people to come in

00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:44,040
and join

00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:53,389
please put yourself on the website right

any other questions I'm early

00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:30,500
kimmo is yes it's based on X abun to all

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:33,170
I've done is I customize the default

00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:38,120
desktop settings and some of the games

00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:42,080
that get included on the CD yeah it's

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:45,380
XFC it runs better on the 400 megahertz

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,210
computers and we gave it a nice pretty

00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,790
desktop something friendly but for the

00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,170
kids to see when you're looking at it

00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,630
you'll see our little ask my friend our

00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:55,970
little into it um he stands in the

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,590
middle of a little ice field and that's

00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:59,630
all there is he's friendly he's engaging

00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:01,550
but he's not so incredibly overwhelming

00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:05,060
that the kids can't focus on anything

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:07,790
else I we've actually had quite good

00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:10,640
success with with the kids with our dog

00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:13,100
came out he he's friendly and fun and

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,380
outgoing and he's kind of developing and

00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:18,520
her a person a persona of his own he has

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:22,460
his own Facebook page for example um

00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:24,500
he's just so nobody and I'm his name

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:31,430
there's a little bit of a story to his

00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:34,580
name our son is Flynn Bob Dylan wrote a

00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:37,340
song about Quinn the Eskimo the the day

he was born we started singing it to him

00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,720
and it just kind of stuck and so when we

00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:44,500
started looking for a name and a

00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:49,220
character to go with our little distro

00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:52,220

it passed it along can't hurt kids can't

00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:17,980
break pace phenomenal it's come out for

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:28,890
kids Qi in the number four kids suck huh

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:28,890
no you can download it from the website

00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:36,730
that's that's about it all for kenna

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:49,570
just putting the estimate any other

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:52,270
questions anyway the what we recommend

00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:54,850
is at least 400 megahertz processor if

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:59,169
you're going to run it from the live CD

00:31:54,850 --> 00:32:01,030
you need at least 256 megs of ram that's

00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:03,250
been the biggest hardware requirements

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:06,130
so far if you're just going to install

00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,890
it you need 192 because we're still

00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:11,169
using the graphical installer hopefully

00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,520
when we get the alternative CD maze will

00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:19,030
be able to bring that down to about

00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:21,960
sixty four mags level about a 60 about a

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,960
6k progress

00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:55,400
so I guess that's the other trick twice

00:32:51,560 --> 00:33:01,070
of all Kevin finds Vegas running away

00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:03,290
sure why I'm needed get to know the guys

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:07,370
at your local electronics recycling

00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:09,920
facility they might be willing to work

00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,140
with you we've been experimenting with

00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,080
some connection at our local dump of all

00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,600
places they are they've agreed to do a

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,730
one for one exchange for us for courts I

00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,130
take them an old via Accord they get a

00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,900
new power cable that's phenomenal

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:25,070
because most of the odd that the

00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:26,900
computers that have to us don't have

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,630
power cables well what am I going to do

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,040
with the box it doesn't have barricade

00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:34,070
so they're exchanging with us and I've

00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,580
gotten good success from want ads of all

00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:39,560
places on craigslist as well as our

00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:42,230
local freecycle community and I know if

00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,450
you're familiar with freecycle there's a

00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,390
whole network of organizations called

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,450
freecycle their online they're basically

00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:52,610
a jockey group at this point there

00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,130
should be one for your local area within

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,720
driving distance you post a long time

00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,030
you say hey listen i'm looking forward x

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,920

let me know if you have donations and I

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:19,070
make arrangements to go and get them yes

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,159
that means that i put the kids in the

00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:23,950
car and haul them to two cities over

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,520
okay so be it we eat lunch at the

00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:29,440
chick-fil-a you know those sorts of

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,119
things that there are little places that

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,399
you can sort of feel out for donations

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,649
from and we've been surprised at the

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:40,720
good amount of success that we've we've

00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:42,730
got just from those places ebay always

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:46,740

00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:46,740
for your ram but at least you can get it

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,810

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:09,270
all of this old stuff I don't know what

00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,010
it is sorted out see if it works our

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,210
opinion is you hand me a box of old

if you want to put computers with kids

direction you start hearing you know

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,870
okay this kid could really use a

00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:09,090
computer mom and dad can't afford it or

00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:11,850
this child has been diagnosed with

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:14,220
cerebral palsy and needs needs

00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:15,810

how to find the adults that you need or

00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:36,810
if there's a an abuse women shelter in

00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:40,950
your local area you know what they might

00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:42,900
like to have a port lab computer lab a

00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:45,870
four-person computer lab because those

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,910
moms are looking for you know how to get

resume you can't get a job without

00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,450
having resume if you don't have a

00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:57,000
computer and you're in a situation where

00:36:54,450 --> 00:37:00,120
you don't want to be you know at the

00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,300
public library typing a resumes a big

00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,300
deal

00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,950
yes

00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:27,830
donated computers from corporations is

00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,530
an interesting sort of project a lot of

00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,190
them that we've run into at least

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,520
already have pretty established

00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:36,860
contracts for recycling their computers

00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,020
okay this generation of computer seems

00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:42,910
to go out we have a contract with either

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:45,410
the supplier or a local organization

00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:47,630
those are kind of hard you know hard

00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:49,730
things to feel out to start with but as

00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:51,890
you kind of get get productive in your

00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:53,510
community you start getting a tie in

00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:56,540
here and it's high in there and suddenly

00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,190
it's become oh now I have a contract

00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,170
with Publix and I can get their next

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,280
generation of computers it's not

00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:07,430
something that we can be right off the

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:10,280
bat but yeah absolutely a lot of them

00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:12,320
are also looking for a 501 C 3 then

00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:17,690
donate to and we're still working or

00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:22,870
selecting the best part 1 he was mad 30

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:27,640
Dodgers it's still pending I'm good if

00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:27,640
the church is there any issue

00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:40,000
I'm not sure um I'm I'm not a accountant

00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:42,070
by any stretch I'm just now starting to

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,150
figure out the inner workings of the IRS

00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:47,350
lord help me I'm not sure that would

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:54,660
definitely be something that you would

00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:54,660
want to speak with no that's fine

00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:32,760
as long as it yeah i would think that as

00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:36,140
long as it was something the church was

00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:42,540
doing you know as a church project

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:44,700
exactly but there's another place where

00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,670
we've gotten a lot of support is from

00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,350
our local church the church we just

00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,720
recently held a big built they were

00:39:49,350 --> 00:40:03,270
built 13 computers and we helped that in

00:39:51,720 --> 00:40:05,070
our fellowship hall in our church that's

00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:07,320
what our lokos planning on doing is

00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:09,930
doing a Saturday activity where we're

00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:14,450
mentoring those you know those selected

00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,450
kids for building their own computers

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,140
third week of August the the last couple

00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:24,359
of weeks before summer break ends when

00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:25,680
all of the camps have closed down and

00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:27,780
the kids are bored and have nothing to

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,930
do all right I've apparently got a

00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,090
two-minute warning so um thank you guys
