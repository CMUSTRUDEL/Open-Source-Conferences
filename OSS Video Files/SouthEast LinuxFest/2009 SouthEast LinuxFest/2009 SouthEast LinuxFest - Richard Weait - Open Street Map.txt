the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,359
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,740
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,049
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,890
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:18,119
southeast linux fest org I was told that

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:20,580
if you ever get nervous about presenting

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:26,670
you should imagine that your audience is

00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:30,439
nude I don't think the people telling me

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,439
that anticipated this audience though

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:37,410
I'm really excited about openstreetmap

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,500
I've been involved with openstreetmap

00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,500
for a couple of years now and it is much

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,410
too big a project to cover completely in

00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:48,570
one hour so hope to give well and I

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,660
don't even have an hour so number 1 i'm

00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,489
going to talk fast number 2 i'm going to

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,739
hit some of the highlights of what is

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,690
possible and then we can cover detailed

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,239
questions about specific applications

00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:02,760
back at the ontario linux fest booth

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,979
would be more than happy to take your

00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,500
questions there feel free to ask

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:09,299
questions during the presentations but

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,270
we may deal with them very quickly and

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,369
then go on to the next slides you are

00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,590
here this is what openstreetmap looks

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:19,710
like that's actually the building we're

00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,740
in at the Hendrix student center the

00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,570
campus map of clemson is actually in

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,840
pretty good shape which is really

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,590
exciting to see why do we care about

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,900
maps at all audience participation you

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,540
can actually answer why do we care about

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,100
most okay so navigation why else do we

00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:44,490
use maps okay transportation navigation

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,200
anything else topographical maps you're

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,030
a professional your cheater you just

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,960
know we won't we won't go back to the

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,850
GIS professionals locate resources

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,590
absolutely did you look at any maps

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,810
around the beginning of november last

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,210
year on TV there were kind of color

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:01,950
coded red and blue something like that

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,290
we use maps to have a look at

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:08,039
infographics we use maps for all kinds

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,239
of data here's a map anybody know the

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,660
history of this one GIS professionals

00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:16,150
can keep quiet okay

00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,700
in the mid-1800s we didn't know where

00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:21,610
cholera came from we thought maybe evil

00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:24,580
spirits maybe bad air and there was a

00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,280
cholera outbreak in London England dr.

00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,650
snow plotted the location of the sick

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,020
people and found that most of them were

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,090
right around this area in central London

00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,250
right around Broad Street and that's

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,980
where the Broad Street pump is where

00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,900
people were getting their drinking water

00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:44,170
eventually dr. snow suggested perhaps

00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,700
cholera was related to water and so

00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:49,570
that's where we where we learned where

00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:53,290
cholera how cholera spreads we also use

00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:55,900
maps to argue about which side of the

00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:00,370
property line the fence should go on and

00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:01,840
so maps can be a tool maps can be used

00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,360
against you against you if you're not

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,130
interested in where the fence is going

00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,360
to go it's going to be your backyard

00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:10,030
that's getting smaller when the neighbor

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,190
puts up a fence so all kinds of things

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,390
that we use maps for that are not just

00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:19,180
purely navigation openstreetmap has been

00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:22,870
called the Wikipedia of maps that's not

00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,990
a bad description openstreetmap is a

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:31,650
tool set to work with geodata but it's

00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:34,330
also a large collection of Geo data and

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:38,080
the goal of openstreetmap is to provide

00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,630
maps to people who care about them you

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,480
need that you need openstreetmap because

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:46,270
the maps that you think of as being free

00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,930
maybe zero cost but they're not free as

00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:52,630
in freedom and the basic concept of

00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:54,670
openstreetmap is I'll make a map of my

00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,930
neighborhood and share it with you you

00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,820
make a map of your neighborhood and

00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,410
share it with me and eventually with

00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:03,459
enough contributors we've mapped

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:05,410
everything for everybody the key

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,200
strengths to openstreetmap is its

00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:10,630
community there are over 125,000

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,820
contributors to openstreetmap in the six

00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:14,860
or so years since the project started

00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,500
now that numbers out of date because I

00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:21,160
looked at it last night the project

00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:22,330
doubles every six months or faster there

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,620
are more people contributing to

00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:26,039
openstreetmap today than there were

00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,039
yesterday

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,550
many people contribute data to

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:35,990
openstreetmap using a consumer-grade

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,960
handheld gps device like this one this

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:42,110
sort of GPS in very simple terms works

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,350
using the GPS satellite system that's

00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:48,200
orbiting the earth the GPS satellites

00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,110
are doing the electron electronic

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:54,680
equivalent of saying ping Here I am ping

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,360
here I am and a handheld receiver on or

00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,790
near the surface of the earth here

00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,340
receive signals from several satellites

00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:05,930
and then estimates where it is on the

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:09,320
surface of the earth or above it those

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:11,720
basic GPS devices will generally tell

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,550
you where you are right now with a small

00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,100
configuration change you can generally

00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:20,270
get them to record where you have been

00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,120
over time you collect those tracks that

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,070
that leave sort of a breadcrumb trail

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,010
where you travel over time and you end

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:29,150
up with something looking like this

00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,320
wandering around doing a little survey

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:35,030
in a neighborhood near near where I live

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,860
while you're doing that survey wandering

00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:39,850
around looking at things you can record

00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:42,800
your observations where's where's the

00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,000
the elementary school where's the

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,120
bowling alley and where's the coffee

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,980
shop you can make those notes some

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,290
people like to sketch a little map some

00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,990
people record turn-by-turn instructions

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,780
of where they find things some people

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,150
take photos of the things that they want

00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,310
to put onto the map and then the editors

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:03,770
can combine those photos with their

00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,240
track file so that they put the picture

00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:09,770
of the thing right on the map for you

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:12,500
and others like to talk into a voice

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,210
memo recorder and listen to those

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,890
instructions as they do the editing on

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:20,960
the map in take that information and

00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:23,210
turn it into metadata with one of the

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,000
OpenStreetMap editors and contribute it

00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,960
to the OpenStreetMap server where it

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,130
gets magically turned into an actual map

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,750
it's a pretty cool process there are

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:38,000
people thousands of people around the

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:41,660
world doing that contributing data in it

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,780
university campuses in neighborhoods in

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,880
national forests almost any place you

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,200
can imagine to put on a map people are

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,640
putting on the map with openstreetmap

00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,670
one of the way one of the ways that

00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,960
openstreetmap is encouraging people to

00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,670
participate and contribute to

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,330
openstreetmap is by hoping hosting

00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:04,760
mapping parties mapping parties started

00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,620
in the United Kingdom where our British

00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,520
cousins tend to like to drink a beverage

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:13,850
or two and people will get together with

00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,450
a goal of mapping a specific area or a

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:19,160
specific type of point of interest

00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:20,960
they'll divide up the territory they

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,580
plan to map go out and do the mapping

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:29,540
come back and contribute at

00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:31,610
openstreetmap this is a result of a

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:36,130
mapping party and the track files that

00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:36,130
people collected at the mapping party

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,420
the gps's are generally good to about 3

00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:57,730
to 5 meters so 325 yards that's plenty

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:59,470
for most applications ideally you want

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,410
to set your gps to save a sample every

00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:04,960
second most of them will by default try

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,670
and save internal memory and so they'll

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,620
use an algorithm to save fewer points

00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,900
and save memory you don't want to use

00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:14,830
that that algorithm will throw away

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:18,250
stuff you'll want if you get enough

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:21,100
people having enough mapping parties you

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:25,840
can go from this empty slate this is the

00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,550
map of Toronto as of late 2006 and then

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,840
people started mapping by mapping one

00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,670
interchange and then a couple of

00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,490
neighborhoods and then more and more

00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:35,320
people got involved in the project and

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,539
so you can see that with the interest of

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,580
just a couple of people and a little bit

00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:41,280
of free time and talking to people and

00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,880
getting other people excited about

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:48,490
mapping the map of a complete city can

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,430
develop and practically appear before

00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:54,120
your eyes there's a little slow down for

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,120
bad weather here

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:07,120
it's a wiki so last edit wins the

00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:10,029
community is really good about

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,890
incremental improvement so unless you

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,720
know for some reason that your data is

00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:18,700
better than the previous contributors

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,170
data why bother changing it and so the

00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:24,160
course over the course of the two years

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:26,560
since late two thousand six we see that

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,310
the map of Toronto has come from an

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,930
empty field to pretty comprehensively

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,149
map to get a couple more months left in

00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,010
the animation here if you look at

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:39,100
toronto now it's developed even further

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,500
and substantially complete for the road

00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,000
network points of interest and other

00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:48,279
things like that certainly can be still

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:52,720
be added to the map of toronto yes don't

00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:56,079
know okay and i think that's the end of

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,850
the animation for the toronto but what

00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,100
you end up with is people contributing

00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:10,180
to maps here and there and everywhere

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:12,250
yes sir hmm i would suggest instead that

00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,769
you use the downloads that work on some

00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,360
of those proprietary devices from open

00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:22,660
street map because I've got them running

00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:24,850
our mind absolutely so you get maps not

00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:27,130
not just of Toronto not just of Clemson

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:28,779
University but a map of Berlin and not

00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:32,649
just a map of Berlin but a map of the

00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:33,850
Berlin Zoo okay you'll notice what's in

00:10:32,649 --> 00:10:36,459
the top right corner this is an

00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:38,170
open-source convention the penguin

00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:40,850
enclosure

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:44,330
it's not just a map of Berlin but it's

00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:47,660
also a map of a an amusement park and

00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,370
the rides at the amusement park it's not

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:53,780
just a map of Rotterdam but it's a map

00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:55,970
of router damn for cyclists it's a map

00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,580
of Rotterdam or a map for cyclists that

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:02,450
you can put on your GPS sorry you were

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:05,000
just a couple of slides ahead of me it's

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,800
a not just a map of Copenhagen but it's

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,380
a map of Copenhagen that you can print

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,360
out at high resolution and give or sell

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,340
to tourists because you can use

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,120
OpenStreetMap data for commercial

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,980
purposes if you choose to here's another

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,160
campus map at the University of Maryland

00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:24,290
in College Park Maryland these students

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,300
there did a great job of mapping their

00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,520
campus I'm told that they were doing

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,140
this for credit so I guess they would

00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,210
pay a little attention to it and get the

00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,970
get out there and do some mapping but

00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,410
the computer science students then

00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,360
deployed their own version of open

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:41,150
street map and customized it with

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:43,430
routing software so here you see how to

00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:45,080
get on the Left from one part of the

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:48,110
plant science building to the other and

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,540
on the right after selecting the nope no

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,589
stairs option in the route planner you

00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:54,080
find you have to go around the other

00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:56,780
side of the building so if you're on

00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:58,370
your skateboard or your segway you can

00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,380
find your way around campus at the

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,790
University of Maryland I'm sure there

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,310
are some other more socially correct

00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:07,580
uses for that software but I I can't

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:09,740
imagine what they would be so open

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:11,540
street map is maps of places that you've

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,640
heard of and you would expect to have

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,190
really good maps like New York and San

00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,230
Francisco but it's also maps of places

00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,930
that you might not think of it might not

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,910
think about very often like Cyprus where

00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:25,910
the United Nations has been playing

00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,360
keep-away between arguing factions over

00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,910
whether Cyprus should be thought of as

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,410
Turkish or Greek territory now Cyprus is

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,230
an interesting case study for

00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:38,270
openstreetmap and the wiki aspect of

00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:42,820
openstreetmap because it was the site of

00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:45,560
open street maps first edit war now the

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,690
general rule in OpenStreetMap is what is

00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:50,900
on the ground is what goes into the

00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,830
database there is a contributor in

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,620
Cyprus

00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:57,080
every time he gets home at night plugs

00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:59,210
in to openstreetmap and changes the name

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,070
of his town back to the name of the town

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:03,740
that was on the sign when he drove home

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,920
that night there's another contributor

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:09,350
who lives away and changes it back to

00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,140
the name it had when his father lived

00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:16,660
there many years ago the guy who lives

00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,660
away has a shell script now

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:26,370
now openstreetmap does handle

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,650
internationalization you can put a

00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:32,650
separate Greek name and separate Turkish

00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:35,410
name for each object and if if that were

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,850
enough to solve this problem then there

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,860
wouldn't have been an edit warrant

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,930
Cyprus and the united nations would not

00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,780
have to be there to keep people from

00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:45,550
scuffling but that's not enough for

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,640
these folks they both want to be the

00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:51,460
default and if we had a way to solve

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,620
that other than blacklisting I peas and

00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:57,250
you know the sending separate map tiles

00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,930
to the different people we want to know

00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:01,300
what your ideas on how to solve this

00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:03,280
problem with human nature we think the

00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,460
software tools are pretty good but human

00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,780
nature we still have to work on their

00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:11,680
maps of some other really interesting

00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:13,840
places in OpenStreetMap Baghdad you can

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,890
see that we've got Arabic names as well

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:21,040
as romanized romanized names for some

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,150
objects in Baghdad as well Kinshasa is

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,040
probably one of the most dangerous

00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,960
places on the planet right now and

00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,110
openstreetmap has a pretty good map of

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,630
Kinshasa Gaza City was recently

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,000
redecorated and there are some

00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,070
volunteers from openstreetmap who are on

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,010
the ground there and trying to rebuild

00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:40,510
the the maps for the people in Gaza City

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,710
would need to be able to go and get

00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,610
their groceries and go and visit

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:47,620
grandma's house the result of all of

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:50,440
these people mapping in all of these

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:53,410
places around the world is shown in this

00:14:50,440 --> 00:15:00,730
video showing the edits from the year

00:14:53,410 --> 00:15:03,210
2000 we getting any audio yeah there's

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:06,010
there's a little background audio here

00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:09,490
but I'd suggest you go have a look at

00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:16,300
the oh I didn't plug in the other will

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:18,770
go without it Oh rock show

00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:22,580
so resuming out from England and Europe

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:28,640
and each of these white flashes is one

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:30,230
edit from one editor during 2008 and so

00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:32,150
we can see that there is activity and

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,990
openstreetmap all around the world all

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:38,120
year we're going through the year 2008

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,350
two and a half times that's why we saw

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,350
it reset there for a little bit

00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,690
okay so thank you very much too I tio I

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:32,350
to a world and Peter Miller for that

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:33,920
video that's some awesome visual

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:37,430
visualization of what happened with

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:39,920
openstreetmap last year so that's what

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,620
openstreetmap is so why what's the

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,210
difference why wouldn't you just use big

00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:47,810
proprietary mapping system that

00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:52,160
somebody's already heard of they're all

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:53,540
awesome in their own way but they have

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,700
shortcomings and the biggest short

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,310
coming is that for the most part they

00:16:55,700 --> 00:17:00,350
just give you a picture of the data

00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:04,010
sometimes you really need access to the

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:05,810
data here's one example open route

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:07,970
service org is based out of the

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:11,210
University of Bonn in Germany and they

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,010
do route planning and with OpenStreetMap

00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:16,060
data so you go to their website and you

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:18,530
see the very similar openstreetmap

00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,600
slippy map interface on the right-hand

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:23,810
side and on the left you can do your

00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,070
route planning you can choose language

00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:28,600
you can choose whether you're traveling

00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:31,070
by vehicle on foot or by bicycle as well

00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:33,800
and you can choose the the shortest

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:35,750
route or the fastest route as well so

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,250
like most route planners you can you

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:39,260
find the map of the area that you're

00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:41,300
interested in you can assign a starting

00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:43,340
point and an ending point and it will

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,860
give you a path that it recommends for

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:49,520
you to take for your trip but they've

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:51,800
also got access to a municipal traffic

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,170
and construction server that tells you

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,570
where there's local congestion in real

00:17:54,170 --> 00:18:00,440
time and when you have the underlying

00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,090
data instead of just having to say well

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,190
looks like my trips going to be slow

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:05,900
because the highway is congested you can

00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:08,570
tell the software to recalculate and

00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,220
give you a new path and that's something

00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:12,020
that you can only do if you have the

00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,970
data if you just have these image tiles

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,200
that are a picture of the data you can't

00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:20,000
recalculate that stuff another benefit

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,550
of having the data is that you can

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,130
present it in ways that are important to

00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:28,100
your application now these are two

00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:30,770
images of the same area in England on

00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,050
the left you see the default rendering

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:34,269
of the map and on the right you see this

00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:38,440
cycle map rendering

00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:39,999
of that same area on the Left we see the

00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:42,039
different highways color-coded by the

00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:44,049
the type of highway the different roads

00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:46,779
but by the type of road that they are on

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:48,459
the right we see emphasize those roads

00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:50,169
that have official cycle route

00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:53,580
designations on them and you see the

00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:55,989
cycle route numbers as well you also see

00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,109
elevation contours and he'll shading

00:18:55,989 --> 00:19:00,580
because I hear that cyclists sometimes

00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:05,469
they're looking for a challenging hill

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:07,749
to climb and other times maybe not but

00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:10,389
the cycle map is is a good enough

00:19:07,749 --> 00:19:12,399
implementation of cartography that it

00:19:10,389 --> 00:19:15,219
was actually recognized by the British

00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:18,039
cartographic Society at the end of 2008

00:19:15,219 --> 00:19:20,229
so congratulations to dave stubbs and

00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:22,539
andy allen who who put together the

00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:26,709
cycle map using openstreetmap tools and

00:19:22,539 --> 00:19:30,369
openstreetmap data you can also put Maps

00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:32,079
put things on the map that commercial

00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:36,070
mapping companies just don't care about

00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:40,479
does anybody know what this is these ski

00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:41,589
slopes so you can put your ski resort on

00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:43,809
there they're color-coded by the

00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:46,509
difficulty of the ski slopes and the

00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:47,950
dotted black lines are lifts and they

00:19:46,509 --> 00:19:52,119
have different icons for chairlifts and

00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:54,099
for gondolas sometimes you don't care so

00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,299
much about where you're going but how

00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:58,539
big of the hills that you're going to be

00:19:55,299 --> 00:20:02,529
climbing and and so this shows you an

00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:05,619
elevation profile as you follow the blue

00:20:02,529 --> 00:20:07,179
line on the left hand side the elevation

00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:08,379
is shown in the graph on the right hand

00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,169
side so you can see that you'll be

00:20:08,379 --> 00:20:13,570
starting at about 450 meters and then

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,369
dropping down into the valley of 340

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:17,200
meters and then climbing up to about 500

00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:24,129
meters on the right-hand side as you as

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:28,839
you finish yes sir can do no reason not

00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:30,959
I don't know if yeah if you have the

00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:30,959
data

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:39,280
no we we don't store elevation data in

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,110
OpenStreetMap we pull in the elevation

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,260
data from the SRT M mission from the

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:47,740
Space Shuttle is yeah because handheld

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:48,880
GPS s are really bad at elevation so we

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:53,140
don't even bother with the elevation

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,330
data from gps's yeah yeah I was at the

00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,460
beach and shown as being many many

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:02,830
meters below that was a little

00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:08,200
disturbing was there a question over

00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:09,610
here as well okay very good so what are

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,570
some of the other advantages of

00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:15,550
openstreetmap we see the here's here's a

00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:18,520
neat one lie close does anybody know

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,320
about light clothes my clothes is really

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,990
interesting it's the the little dead end

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:24,790
street there and if you try to turn left

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,010
into light clothes this is what you see

00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:31,420
on the right-hand side there is actually

00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:33,490
no lie close like clothes is called a an

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:36,340
easter egg or a cartographic watermark

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:40,000
or a trap Street and it was featured in

00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,640
a in a copyright infringement case that

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,520
a to z maps one because somebody had

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,000
copied their map and put like clothes on

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,670
it so cartographers for as long as

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,700
cartographers have been spending the

00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,890
time to make painstakingly make really

00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,140
good maps they've been putting things on

00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,990
the maps that just don't exist it's like

00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:05,860
trap streets phantom bridges imaginary

00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:07,240
churches swamps of imagination because

00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,790
other people have been trying to copy

00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:11,470
their maps and rip them off so if you

00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:13,870
copy any substantial area on a

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:17,230
commercial map chances are you're

00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:19,690
copying a couple of these traps treats

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:24,370
or other cartographic watermarks and

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,630
that's how people generally prosecute

00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:28,030
their cases against you if you've been

00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:30,970
copyrighted copying their copyright

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:33,660
material without permission so so when

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:38,669
you buy a commercial map you're buying

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:41,590
lies congressional congratulations

00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:43,070
here's an intersection in Toronto as it

00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,320
was shown on

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,539
maps up until the 10th forever I haven't

00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,130
checked just recently but it's been like

00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:52,580
this for a couple of years here's the

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:55,460
truth of that intersection okay now this

00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,350
this street was traffic calmed a couple

00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:00,049
of years ago and so if you look at the

00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:02,240
aerial photos what you see looks like a

00:23:00,049 --> 00:23:04,070
through Street but there are bollards in

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,720
the way and so if you try and drive

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,779
through there you're in for a lot of

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:10,549
bodywork basically but you can still

00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:14,000
walk or cycle through there you just

00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:16,820
just can't drive through there it's not

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,230
google's fault they buy this data from

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,940
in this case it says here tele atlas

00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,710
they might have bought it from tell

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,139
alice or from navteq those are the two

00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:27,620
big commercial vector data suppliers in

00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:30,769
north america until atlas navteq only

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:32,419
collect the data for your town every 2

00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:35,320
to 10 years depending on how

00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:38,480
commercially interesting your town maybe

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:42,190
so if they haven't come since the

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,159
traffic calming you're getting old data

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:49,009
here's another case where the data is

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,899
old in this case it's on the yahoo maps

00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,870
and again the data was checked in

00:23:50,899 --> 00:23:56,929
February on februari 10th it may have

00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,879
been updated since then skipton crescent

00:23:56,929 --> 00:24:00,200
was built a couple of years ago people

00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:02,419
have been living there for quite some

00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,909
time skipton crescent still doesn't show

00:24:02,419 --> 00:24:07,309
up on the yahoo maps how can you have a

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:09,559
housewarming party if your house isn't

00:24:07,309 --> 00:24:11,480
on the map so with openstreetmap you can

00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:14,600
put your house on the map and have your

00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:18,169
housewarming party there are places that

00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:21,620
are not commercially interesting to the

00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:23,899
commercial map companies in this case

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:27,370
yahoo shows Reykjavik having a couple of

00:24:23,899 --> 00:24:30,110
roads google shows it with nothing

00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:32,870
Reykjavik may be cold and far away but

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:36,049
it is substantially more interesting

00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:38,929
than shown by Google or Yahoo this is

00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:41,269
the OpenStreetMap map of Reykjavik a

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:44,149
couple of people interested in providing

00:24:41,269 --> 00:24:47,899
maps can put together a really good map

00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:50,570
of a substantial area you understand

00:24:47,899 --> 00:24:53,389
because commercial mapping companies

00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:55,789
have to collect data for less than they

00:24:53,389 --> 00:24:56,570
can sell the data why there might be

00:24:55,789 --> 00:25:01,190
small

00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:07,250
that they're not able to map Bombay's

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:09,110
not so small why is it not mapped it's

00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,340
not called Bombay anymore either you'll

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,250
notice it's called Mumbai and

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:17,419
openstreetmap now this screen shot was

00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:18,769
taken in 2008 to be fair yahoo and

00:25:17,419 --> 00:25:20,000
google have both caught up to

00:25:18,769 --> 00:25:22,700
openstreetmap so I'd like to

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,860
congratulate them on being able to match

00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:33,080
the productivity for a Vogon street map

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:35,149
in this case how come they don't I you

00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:38,149
would have to ask them I would imagine

00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:39,590
though that they must have a delicate

00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:47,960
relationship with the commercial map

00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:50,000
suppliers or maybe that the contracts

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,120
are just older than the existence of

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:58,100
openstreetmap as well I'd love to see

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,960
them using open data wouldn't you the

00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,139
generous licensing of openstreetmap yes

00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,139
ma'am

00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:43,080
yeah Oh they've changed that now so it's

00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:46,059
it's not being stifled I had heard that

00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,639
even mapping on the ground with the GPS

00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:50,799
was not officially permitted in Beijing

00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:53,080
as we're in China as well I don't know

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,059
if this is true but I do know that after

00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:57,159
the Beijing Olympics there was an awful

00:26:55,059 --> 00:26:59,979
lot of new mapping that was done after

00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:02,529
people came home which was I thought

00:26:59,979 --> 00:27:04,089
that was pretty interesting the

00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:05,889
licensing of openstreetmap and

00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:07,869
OpenStreetMap data allows you to do

00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:11,109
really interesting things with it like

00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:13,599
print and sell maps you know for

00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:17,409
tourists or four in this case this is a

00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:20,499
a map on the left a map for young

00:27:17,409 --> 00:27:23,950
tourists in copenhagen on the right is a

00:27:20,499 --> 00:27:28,029
map for a an open source GIS conference

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:30,549
held in Germany but you could even take

00:27:28,029 --> 00:27:33,399
a map from open street map and use it as

00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:35,710
the cover of your next great novel sell

00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:38,320
millions of copies make a huge fortune

00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:41,080
and it's okay you don't have to get a

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,080
special license to be able to use the

00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,249
map images from open street map in

00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:47,710
interesting ways the it's a Creative

00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:49,059
Commons license so you just do as

00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:50,919
required by the creative commons

00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:54,719
attribution-share alike and you're off

00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:57,759
to the races and and and another

00:27:54,719 --> 00:28:01,119
interesting benefit of openstreetmap is

00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,859
that you can get all of the software you

00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,839
can get all of the software you can run

00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:07,089
your own local copy you can experiment

00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,969
with it you can write new code to go

00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:12,999
along with it but you can run

00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:17,549
openstreetmap just as its run on the

00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:17,549
server in in England yes

00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:24,440
currently postgres it was it was my

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:30,740
sequel up until just a couple of months

00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:32,210
ago at the last API change okay so how

00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:34,250
do you get started with openstreetmap

00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,690
I've said it's a huge project I've said

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:37,790
that I can't possibly tell you

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,980
everything about it but I can get you

00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:41,960
started on it you can go to the

00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:44,390
OpenStreetMap website and register for

00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,220
an account that's all the permission you

00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:48,470
need to start contributing to the wiki

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:51,920
map of everything it takes an email

00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:55,670
address once you get the confirmation

00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:56,870
email you can login don't click the edit

00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,660
button while you're watching the whole

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:02,540
world it takes a long time to download

00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:06,290
all of that into your browser and the

00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,850
server people will be very upset it

00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:10,400
won't it actually let you download the

00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:12,200
whole world into your browser zoom in to

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,450
a place that you find interesting maybe

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,700
just a couple of blocks or just a couple

00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:19,970
of buildings to start with and then you

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,710
can click on the edit button there's an

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:24,650
act there is actually an in-browser

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,300
editor it's a flash-based editor for

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:29,480
openstreetmap there are other editors as

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:32,180
well but this one you don't have to

00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:36,590
download and so you can choose to either

00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:38,710
edit with save or edit live think of the

00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:41,270
edit with save as being a practice mode

00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,340
you can make all of the changes you like

00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:45,320
on the map and until you press the Save

00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:47,660
button you don't have to worry about

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:51,170
whether you did it right or not if using

00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,420
the Edit live mode every time you select

00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:56,090
something new the last thing you edited

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:57,620
gets uploaded life so something to be

00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,850
aware of while you're working with

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:05,180
openstreetmap here is the campus of

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:08,030
clemson in offline editing mode so we

00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:09,560
could then go about selecting something

00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:11,300
and then changing its attributes we're

00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,520
moving it or adding something to the map

00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,340
play around with the editor get used to

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:18,590
how the editing tools work and maybe

00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:21,230
come to the interior linux fest booth

00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:23,300
and i'll put the editor on my laptop and

00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,700
let you play with it there it was there

00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:35,880
a question nope ok

00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:38,340
yes that that brand name GPS that you

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,710
mentioned is closed proprietary hardware

00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,110
and closed software as far as I know I'm

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:47,940
unaware of any open source software

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:51,240
that's available for that device some of

00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,920
their proprietary data format has been

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,190
reverse-engineered so we're able to load

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:59,400
OpenStreetMap data onto their device but

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:01,890
I'm not aware of any modifications to

00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:05,570
their software that are available I'm

00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,570
going to get you first and then you

00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:32,639
absolutely well we saw routing in the

00:31:28,669 --> 00:31:34,619
open service demonstration a few slides

00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,499
ago the data is stored as vectors in the

00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:40,409
database in the browser by default

00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:41,849
you're seeing rendered pixels so it is

00:31:40,409 --> 00:31:43,319
just a picture of the data in the

00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:46,469
browser by default because it works

00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:50,159
really well in the browser if you want

00:31:46,469 --> 00:31:51,569
an underlying data layer as well you can

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,759
download that separately and then start

00:31:51,569 --> 00:32:09,149
working with that as well and then there

00:31:53,759 --> 00:32:10,709
was a question yes sir absolutely if

00:32:09,149 --> 00:32:12,029
there's a wiki link on the page right

00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:14,009
there that you can see on the left and

00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:17,339
so you can reach the wiki it's wicked

00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:20,039
openstreetmap org and if you use the

00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:23,729
search engine on that wiki to type GPS

00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:25,619
reviews you'll see a long long list very

00:32:23,729 --> 00:32:27,749
detailed list of different GPS devices

00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:29,759
and how successful or unsuccessful

00:32:27,749 --> 00:32:37,289
they've been with different aspects of

00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:47,519
openstreetmap yes sir Street View you

00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:48,839
mean okay yep are you doing anything

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,780
like that you're asking people to select

00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:54,190
photos as you're going

00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,590
there there are some people who are

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,990
doing street view similar things with

00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,420
openstreetmap tools and OpenStreetMap

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,429
data but we have no place to put all of

00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:08,280
those photos or video in the

00:33:03,429 --> 00:33:10,840
OpenStreetMap server it's a user funded

00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:13,090
project and servers just don't have the

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:16,420
capacity for things like photos for

00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,470
Flickr or videos for street view one

00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:23,920
more and we'll try and get back to the

00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:28,210
slides yeah at least this many yes

00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:31,300
there's a lot as the database doubles in

00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:33,309
size just about every six months about

00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:36,550
six gig compressed last time I looked

00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:40,890
it's it's XML so it gets really big when

00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:44,290
you decompress them yeah okay let's say

00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:46,450
so so selecting selecting an object in

00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:47,740
the editor here click once on the

00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,090
boundary of the object it gets

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,340
highlighted and then down on the bottom

00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,850
we see the properties of that object in

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:57,100
this case it's a building it's operated

00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:01,330
by the University of Toronto it's the

00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,679
faculty have applied something applied

00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:08,139
math and it's called the called the

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,669
Galbraith building and so if you wanted

00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:11,409
to add something about that building you

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:13,179
could add add to it right here and then

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:16,780
click the upload button and it would be

00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:19,480
contributed to openstreetmap here's a

00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:21,580
shopping center in central Toronto it

00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,740
was previously shown as just a building

00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:28,659
surrounded by an undifferentiated grey

00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:30,760
area of unused undefined space and I

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:33,190
knew from personal experience that it

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,859
was actually a parking lot here you can

00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,540
see in the background the aerial of

00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:41,379
aerial imagery can you make that out of

00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:43,929
a projector Yahoo very graciously allows

00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:47,169
us use of their aerial photography to

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:49,179
trace objects on openstreetmap so thank

00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:52,480
you very much Yahoo we really appreciate

00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:53,980
your support google also gave us a bunch

00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,690
of money for a new server for our

00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:58,540
database server thank you very much

00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:00,609
Google it's really wonderful to have the

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,180
support of people who are also doing

00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:04,690
online

00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,460
mapping for this open source project so

00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:09,089
in this case I traced the outline of the

00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,440
parking area and then defined it as a

00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:14,859
parking area so that instead of being

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,630
this kind of undifferentiated gray

00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:20,800
unused area on the map it's now an

00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,960
undifferentiated great parking lot there

00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,220
are lots of resources for openstreetmap

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,950
on the web the OpenStreetMap wiki is one

00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,530
place i've blogged about a few things

00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:34,359
that you can do with openstreetmap on my

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,540
website shown on the bond at the bottom

00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:40,480
there participate in a local mapping

00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,339
party or host one yourself they're fun

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,920
they're a cool way to meet other people

00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:46,480
interested in location location based

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,940
services or just learning more about

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,420
your neighborhood and thank you so much

00:35:48,940 --> 00:36:06,910
for your time I welcome your questions

00:35:51,420 --> 00:36:10,359
yes read my blog read my blog I don't

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:19,450
think maps are the problem yeah a map is

00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:23,400
just a tool yeah yes oh yeah does the

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,400
official ground reference points yep

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:36,250
mm-hmm I don't see why they couldn't be

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:40,329
put in but because we're generally

00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:41,650
working from GPS coordinates I don't see

00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:43,540
what the benefit would be of the the

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,160
ground reference points I know that the

00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,020
for Canada the ground reference points

00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,160
are available in a file that was

00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:53,950
contributed by the Canadian government

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,299
so we can we can just upload them by I

00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:56,829
don't know i haven't seen no of them i

00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:01,100
don't know if what the the symbols are

00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:04,340
that are on them yes yeah we do next

00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:06,140
like to do list location your website

00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,090
works like this area really needs to

00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,080
help you know so we go where would I go

00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:13,490
in our area to really get the the best

00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,690
way to find out what you need to map

00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,550
locally is just to look on the map

00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,050
locally because if you're when you're

00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:19,910
familiar with an area you can look at

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,890
the map as it Oh Richard you idiot you

00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:25,340
haven't mapped such and such and then

00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:27,770
just go out and do it but but things

00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:30,950
that can almost always be added to the

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:34,310
map that really add functionality the

00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:36,470
map are things like a dressing so the

00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:38,060
campus may be really well mapped but do

00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:40,040
we have the street addresses for all of

00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,990
the buildings there's a way now to put

00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,580
that information in to openstreetmap so

00:37:41,990 --> 00:38:07,910
that people can use the search engine to

00:37:43,580 --> 00:38:10,430
find it yes sir i disagree i think we

00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,490
have more detail maybe yeah I think

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:15,620
maybe cities I agree with maybe some

00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:17,510
smaller places if what you're giving

00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:21,410
another thing I think that about them is

00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:24,290
they also said that users added map on

00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:26,360
the browser itself and they also have

00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:28,460
the backup of the satellite imagery

00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:30,440
query so it's easier for people to is my

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:35,930
map pack without actually going with the

00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:38,150
GPS so my questions are first of all the

00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:42,400
easier question

00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,400
now give me the hard one go ahead yeah

00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,869
5300 papers regarding the same thing and

00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:57,799
if you had not this maybe Google these

00:38:53,869 --> 00:39:00,349
days have a kind of a flood geometry

00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:03,369
projection of even buildings in this

00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:18,589
treatment mm-hmm I'm doing that using

00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:21,380
image okay that was a long set up for

00:39:18,589 --> 00:39:23,650
that question there's there's nothing

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:27,589
stopping you from doing that with

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:30,230
openstreetmap I'm not aware of anybody

00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:31,819
who is doing 3d projections of buildings

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,010
we do building outlines as well

00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:36,920
obviously we do already have building

00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,569
outlines in OpenStreetMap sounds like an

00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,980
interesting add-on project if you wanted

00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:41,980
to contribute some code for that

00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:53,130
an awful lot of really important

00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,780
contributions can only come from people

00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:56,220
on the ground because they're they're

00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,750
contributing the data but they're also

00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,560
contributing the love that goes into

00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:03,540
that data and that's really important

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,750
but we've also had automated

00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,550
contributions from some big and

00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:10,050
important data sets like the road

00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:12,600
network for the United States came

00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:15,630
largely from the tiger data set which is

00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:18,170
a public domain data set the National

00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:21,000
mapping agency of Canada geo base

00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:22,640
contributed the Canadian road network

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,200
and other data and we're currently

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,750
converting and importing that data to

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,730
openstreetmap the you may have noticed

00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:32,430
in the animation that india the road

00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:35,280
network appeared all at once that a lot

00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:37,350
of that was contributed by automotive

00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:40,830
navigation data a mapping company in the

00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:44,130
netherlands so so we do have sources

00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,990
other than individual contributors but

00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:48,650
the individual contributors are really

00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,730
the important part part because they are

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:52,320
contributing things that real people

00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,890
care about their caring enough to

00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:59,070
contribute it not just the road network

00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:01,410
and the road networks interesting once

00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:03,000
once you've gotten to where you're going

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:04,860
what do you care about the road network

00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,890
it's not about the road in front of

00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:14,040
Grandma's house is about grandma's house

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:17,700
okay yes well you wanted an extension

00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:20,930
for your data set let's face in your

00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:24,510
structure we're doing those extensions

00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:27,150
you've got their offices and XML it it's

00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:32,670
an open source project so patches

00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:34,350
welcome always it's the data set the way

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:36,060
we tag objects in the data set is

00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:38,490
actually a folksonomy so rather than

00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:40,500
defining a taxonomy and saying this is

00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:43,380
how you must define the data and this is

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,630
the way it shall always be the official

00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,420
policy is do whatever you like with the

00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:50,250
tagging you know if if you want to if

00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:52,290
you don't want to call it a building and

00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:55,620
you want to call it an edifice instead

00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:57,180
go for it you're free to do it nobody's

00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,890
going to tell you that you're wrong it

00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:04,950
won't show up in the default renderings

00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:06,450
but if it's if you want to put in custom

00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:08,670
data that's important to you in a way

00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:10,980
that makes sense to you that doesn't

00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:13,740
follow the community standards you can

00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,630
do that and then you can modify the

00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,760
renderers so that it shows up in a way

00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:20,970
that's important to you on your copy of

00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,380
the map the general purpose map which

00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:24,990
shows up by default and openstreetmap

00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,200
will never show it though because it's

00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:30,510
something to specific or too strange or

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:37,290
too localized and it just won't show up

00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:39,360
in the default renderer it's an open

00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:41,400
source project so there's the there

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,010
might be something like a committee but

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,870
it's also something like mob rule yeah

00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,950
in a friendly way it's friendly friendly

00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:48,950
mob rule yes ma'am

00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:12,349
yes yes there are two renderers that are

00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:14,180
used currently in OpenStreetMap one is

00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:18,140
called map Nick that's a general purpose

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:22,189
map rendering project and they use style

00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:25,489
sheets that are very much XML ish and

00:43:22,189 --> 00:43:27,410
they also import other graphics to mix

00:43:25,489 --> 00:43:29,569
into the rendering that they're doing

00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:31,809
with the shapefiles there's another one

00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:34,699
that's homegrown at openstreetmap called

00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:36,319
Ozma render and it's actually a

00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:37,729
distributed rendering project so it's

00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,229
kind of interesting from a distributed

00:43:37,729 --> 00:43:43,099
computing point of view as well as from

00:43:39,229 --> 00:43:46,759
a GIS point of view and so have a look

00:43:43,099 --> 00:43:49,430
at Ozma render and map neck if you want

00:43:46,759 --> 00:43:52,699
to get into the cartography of

00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:54,939
openstreetmap were there any questions

00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:54,939
yeah

00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:11,630
not that I'm aware of not that I'm aware

00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,660
of I know we do have the right tags for

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,369
tunnels we can we can absolutely we can

00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,150
represent tunnels very nicely in the

00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:21,800
database but I'm not aware of anybody

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,990
mapping those tunnels I don't see what

00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,250
would be unlawful about mapping those

00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:29,230
tunnels as long as those tunnels

00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:29,230
actually exist I want them in the map

00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:43,700
yeah they might find it interesting too

00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:49,670
yes ma'am well you can't edit it

00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:55,220
yourself it could be Cypress all over

00:44:49,670 --> 00:45:09,050
again yeah yeah well were there some

00:44:55,220 --> 00:45:13,190
other questions yes yeah in

00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:14,840
OpenStreetMap yep do you know for a fact

00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:19,100
that the address that you're looking for

00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:20,900
is already in the database okay please

00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,710
help us with this please help us with

00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:26,600
the search function we we know that

00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,800
there are improvements to be made with

00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:29,780
the search function that's on the

00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,200
website please pitch in and help us with

00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:35,900
that if you're interested in the code if

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,300
you're interested in diving in it's all

00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:41,420
in the subversion repository there is

00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:43,970
code in there in C and C++ their shell

00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:49,130
scripts there is stuff in Perl Python

00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:51,130
PHP Ruby on Rails I don't think there's

00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:53,890
any COBOL but there is some fortran

00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:57,080
there's probably some pascal and

00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:59,450
somebody wrote something in mumps I had

00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:04,480
no idea what mumps is but apparently

00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:09,710
it's used in medical medical programming

00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,960
so grab go so go and grab the repository

00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:12,730
from subversion and start diving into

00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,870
the code

00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:19,780
the folks on IRC shown up there and the

00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:23,140
folks on the mailing lists are fantastic

00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:24,250
so you'll get lots of conversation about

00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,230
the things that you're interested in

00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:27,850
with the developing for openstreetmap

00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:49,000
we're going to go to you first and then

00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:50,740
and then you elevation right the people

00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,570
seem to be having a lot of success with

00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:54,280
bringing in the elevation data as a

00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:57,220
separate layer and then using it in

00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,010
house rather than requiring that it be

00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,020
in OpenStreetMap so I don't know that

00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:04,150
there would be interest in putting that

00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,910
data into openstreetmap that being said

00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:09,790
that may change so I'm not aware of any

00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:11,500
plans to put the elevation data in but I

00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:17,770
don't think it's been completely ruled

00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:31,740
out either and yes yeah one of the

00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:33,670
renders is distributed down yes no

00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:36,760
currently that would all come from the

00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:38,260
main server in london england the the

00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,350
main servers right now at the University

00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:43,210
College of London in London England

00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:48,240
there's some talk and some interest in

00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:50,560
having the OpenStreetMap default servers

00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,600
distributed around the globe certainly

00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:54,340
it makes sense from a network traffic

00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,010
point of view and certainly from a load

00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:00,040
point of view because we we keep topping

00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:02,290
out the the abilities of our servers is

00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:04,660
a project's growing so quickly I think I

00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:06,580
may have one time for one or two more

00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:08,230
short questions and then lots of

00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,730
conversation back at the ontario linux

00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,849
fest booth because i can talk about

00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:23,500
openstreetmap all day just watch me

00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:27,050
ok no more quote one more yep absolutely

00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:28,940
every week there is a snapshot of the

00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,380
database tick and we call it the planet

00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:33,349
file because the map of the whole planet

00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:37,339
isn't that clever and you can get that

00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:38,690
from a a mirror so that I think it's

00:48:37,339 --> 00:48:42,170
every wednesday morning you can download

00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:45,920
a fresh snapshot of the data if you are

00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:48,290
running openstreetmap tools locally you

00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,450
can actually get those weekly updates

00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:54,980
but you can get daily hourly and minute

00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:57,530
lee updates if you want them yeah mm-hmm

00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:58,849
so kind of fun if you want to if you

00:48:57,530 --> 00:49:02,079
want to get involved at that level one

00:48:58,849 --> 00:49:02,079
last question then we're going to roll

00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:17,839
yep yes it's an XML file it's got a lot

00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:21,530
of pointy brackets lot of pointed

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:23,780
brackets it yeah so if you're interested

00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:25,760
just in a smaller area you can also get

00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:28,970
extract files that aren't the complete

00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,160
planet file and and so either get the

00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:33,470
planet file and distill it down to the

00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,890
area that you care about or get an

00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:38,660
extract from somebody who's already

00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:40,490
limited the planet file to the area that

00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:43,130
you care about thank you so much for

00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:47,359
your time thank you also to the folks

00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:48,740
here at Southeast linux fest I know a

00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,650
little bit about what goes into planning

00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:54,220
this sort of a Linux event and I invite

00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:57,619
you to join us at ours september-october

00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:00,290
24th in Toronto come join us at ontario

00:49:57,619 --> 00:50:04,099
linux fest that's tux looking out of the

00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:06,430
outline of Ontario okay so thank you

00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:06,430
