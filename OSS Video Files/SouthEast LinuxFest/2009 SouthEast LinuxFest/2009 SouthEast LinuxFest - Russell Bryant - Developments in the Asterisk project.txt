00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,359
southeast linux fest org alright so

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,020
first of all thank you thank you all for

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,850

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,130
background my name is Russell Bryant I

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,439
work on asterisk and I work for digium

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,810
who is the corporate sponsor of the

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,759
asterisk project and for those of you

00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:35,520
that just heard mark Spencer's

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,899
presentation you know I worked for him

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,239
and I work for his company and I'm one

00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,440
of the guys that he brought in to help

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:44,100
push the company further along and

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,629
further the Astros project and on a

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,629
quick note thank you what is this

00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:58,559
disconnect man it won't get my mouse

00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:00,440
won't go over it that's awesome cool all

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,520
right well now I have to take this off

00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,100
well anyways I'll try to talk while I

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,210
try to fix this but I'm so this is

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,890
really great that it's in clemson

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,540
because I went to Clemson University for

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,460
my undergraduate degree in Computer

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,490
Engineering I just graduated in december

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:21,630
of 2006 and this is the first time I've

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:22,590
been back go away there goes okay so

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,299
it's the first time I've been back since

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:30,810
I graduated so it's really fun to be

00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:32,610
here plug back in and foot and so when I

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,130
was at Clemson this is where i got into

00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,450
open source i mean this is where I and

00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,979
some of the people here that helped me

00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,290
learn a lot about linux are here as well

00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:43,200
as that's pretty exciting and we're back

00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,810
okay so like i said i graduated from

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,490
clemson fall 2006 I've been working on

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,880
asterisk since 2004 that was about the

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:52,979
middle of my college career and I got

00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,740
employed by the corporate sponsor pretty

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,329
shortly after so an overview of what I

00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,009
want to talk about today so first of all

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,180
I want to talk about what is asterisk

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,969
because while that seems like a really

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,579
simple question the answer is not always

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,290
so straightforward and so I do want to

00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:08,520
clarify at least what I think asterisk

00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:10,590
is and i'm curious what you think it is

00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,690
as well i have a number of features that

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,250
i want to talk about just I have a

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,310
random sampling of cool stuff that

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,170
asterisk can do and so and hopefully so

00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,520
whether you're new to asterisk or

00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,170
whether you have a lot of experience

00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,540
with it i hope i can cover something

00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:26,100
that you didn't already know that's

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,630
interesting and i want I'd have two

00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,670
comments about future you know what

00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,320
where are we going from here and then i

00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,500
will have some time for questions and

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,720
answers at the end so what is asterisk

00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,760
and for to start that i'll ask you guys

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:44,310
so someone throw out an answer what is

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:47,370
it it's a pbx a toolkit okay platform

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,810
all right so yeah a PBX that time to

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,520
answer is what is is probably the most

00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,530
common type of answered yet know maybe

00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,300
it's a PBX maybe to some people it's for

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,040
it's a conferencing server maybe you run

00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,600
call conferencing with it maybe it's

00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,280
your voicemail platform if you have an

00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,310
existing phone system but you just use

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,990
asterisk for for voicemail maybe you

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,450
have a you know you have a tech support

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:08,520
department and use it for for your call

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,100
center platform or maybe just you have a

00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:13,260
business and you need an IVR a voice

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,670
menu so let people call in and check on

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,190
the status of an order or something like

00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,390
that but the real good answer that is

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,910
looking for in a couple people said it

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:23,489
is a it's a platform and I really want

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,020
to make that clear it's an hour I guess

00:03:23,489 --> 00:03:29,370
official term it's an open source

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:31,739
telephony applications platform so it's

00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:32,970
not a PBX and so I'm not the marketing

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:34,050
guy i mean the marketing guy would

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,440
probably be telling you oh yeah it's a

00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:40,230
PBX well it's not okay it's a it's like

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,239
I think comparing it to Apache is pretty

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,820
it's pretty good i mean it's it's a it's

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,800
a it's a tool to build your application

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,170
and so that's what a stress provides is

00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,370
it it's for building telephony

00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:52,200
applications and whether you want to

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,510
turn it into a PBX or you want to turn

00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,160
it into letting your plants call you

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,660
when they need water or some other

00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,760
random thing I mean you can do that we

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:01,560
provide all the things we have big

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,120
features built-in like voicemail you

00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,800
mean that's easy to turn on it's like a

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,360
line the configuration file it's like I

00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,489
would like voicemail so we have that

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,200
type of stuff built in but we also have

00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,810
lots of developer interfaces that make

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,580
it easy to build voice application so I

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,440
want to play this sound file I want to

00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,030
listen four digits I want to do these

00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,049
types of things so we have lower level

00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:23,640
things that you can write to as well so

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,140
all right from there I want to talk

00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,590
about some random cool features like I

00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,320
said it's a toolkit and we've

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:30,940
lots of infrastructure in place for

00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,139
building your telephony applications and

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,930
so I'm going to go over some of those

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:36,130
cool things and well and on this note if

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:38,260
you have any questions feel free to

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,080
interrupt me at any time I'd love to to

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,030
answer any questions you may have so

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,520
that all right one of the cool things

00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:46,690
that we have is imap storage for

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,310
voicemail now this is not necessarily

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,320
new feature we actually had a couple

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,300
years now but it's something I do like

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,860
to mention because it's pretty neat so

00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,630
if you you have existing IT

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,790
infrastructure in your business you can

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:00,190
reuse your existing imap infrastructure

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:02,410
for voicemail so you set up asterisk as

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,790
your phone system and you say we know

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,970
when someone leaves you a voicemail go

00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:09,250
store it in this IMAP account so all

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,080
your all your users just use their same

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,520
email client and then yet they have a

00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,310
special folder for voicemail and your

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:17,380
voicemail show up there and the biggest

00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,470
benefit of imap storage for voicemail is

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:22,090
that as opposed to like voicemail to

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:24,340
email is something we've had for forever

00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:26,650
and other systems have it too and that's

00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:29,710
nice but what this does is it's it's

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,240
it's more native so while the phone on

00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,280
your desk will say you have new messages

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,770
or this many new in this many old and

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,810
whatever as you make changes in your

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,010
email client it also gets reflected on

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,330
your phone so there's some native

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:43,479
integration there that makes it really

00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:45,520
nice and and so one of the biggest on

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:47,169
this talk about this feature one of the

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,300
big buzz words and telecom right now is

00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:50,889
unified communications and so this is

00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,510
sort of part of that it's about you know

00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,979
in your business you have all these all

00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:55,599
the different communication

00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:57,430
infrastructure you have your email you

00:05:55,599 --> 00:05:58,750
have your telephones do you have maybe

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:00,760
you have jabber or maybe you have

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,050
whatever and so we're starting to look

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,099
at all these new ways to tie all these

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,660
things together and have better

00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:09,070
integration between them and this is one

00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:12,940
of the things that we have for that and

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:16,060
also on the unified communications note

00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:18,490
we have some native Jabbar or XMPP

00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,220
integration which is a really excellent

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,320
stuff the first thing I have listed here

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,750
is jingle or google talk so we have

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:28,270
native interoperability with google talk

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,979
so you can you can make your your phone

00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,380
system can make calls out to the google

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,659
google google talk network or i can

00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:37,870
receive calls from that network and also

00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:39,400
using the the XMPP standard jingle which

00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,770
is a little bit different than google

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,210
top

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:45,620
very close to the same thing we have

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:48,710
native interoperability with that their

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,539
question okay so another thing you can

00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:53,449
do with this you can have asterisks in

00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:55,759
messages so call routing and handling

00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:57,800
calls is a very scriptable and very good

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,060
you know controllable interface so as a

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,440
one of the things you can do when you're

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,840
handling calls you can have it send

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:04,490
messages and in while this is it's

00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,990
actually a pretty simple feature people

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:09,590
do lots of really cool things for it so

00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:12,139
for example your sales guy a call comes

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:13,460
in and you want to send a message and it

00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:16,130
has like all the information about the

00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,310
caller this is here's a link to his

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,870
account or here's just lots you know

00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,949
whatever you want to have pop up on on

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,900
someone's screen when they get a phone

00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:26,300
call you can help you can use jabber for

00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,740
that send a message you can receive

00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,949
messages that's actually a pretty new

00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,919
thing we can do now so that same example

00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:35,389
say your tech support guy gets a calls

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,879
coming in and he gets a jabber message

00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,469
sort of offering him a call they were

00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:40,490
some reason he doesn't want to take it I

00:07:39,469 --> 00:07:42,409
don't know you could send messages back

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,360
to asterisk to affect call handling

00:07:42,409 --> 00:07:45,680
maybe you want to redirect them to

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,889
someone else or something before you

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,870
even answer the call and so you could

00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:52,580
act on that presents monitoring is

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,469
another thing so you can do call routing

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,449
based on your jabber presence so if

00:07:54,469 --> 00:07:57,740
everyone in your business is using

00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:59,690
jabber because you use that as a way to

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:01,039
communicate and you set yourself away

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:02,509
you can have your phone system

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,840
automatically route calls based on that

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:08,599
information so oh you know Jeff said

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,009
he's he's away right now so I'm going to

00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,599
go ahead and send his call automatically

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:14,349
to voicemail or whatever it is that you

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,330
want to do based on that information and

00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,250
additionally with presents you some of

00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,669
the nicer like new phones that you can

00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:24,409
get have like you can monitor people's

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,360
state on the phone itself so you can

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:28,550
have a little button that's like a speed

00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:31,880
dial for your boss or something and it

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,010
has a little LED next to it so you can

00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:35,300
have Jabbar presents reflect that state

00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,890
that shows up on the phone as well as so

00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:38,990
someone sets their jabber client is away

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,880
and now your phone reflects that person

00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:44,529
is busy so you shouldn't call them so

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,529
all that stuff is built-in

00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:54,100
um Jabbar itself is a it's it's an IT

00:08:51,339 --> 00:08:56,170
IETF standard for instant messaging

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,149
that's probably the basics but there's

00:08:56,170 --> 00:09:00,459
lots of extensions for it including the

00:08:58,149 --> 00:09:02,199
jingle and Google Talk stuff for adding

00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:05,410
voice to it but there's there's lots of

00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:11,649
stuff but it's the short answer is it's

00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:13,360
an IM protocol native calendar

00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:16,660
integration this is something brand-new

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,509
as well that that one of our employees

00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:23,259
that that works with me I did in his

00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:24,730
free time he had some meetings well he

00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:26,649
had trouble he had trouble making it to

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,360
meetings he's a he's a developer it gets

00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,740
into code and he always forgets meetings

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,149
mrs. conference called so forth so he

00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,709
said you know what it would be great if

00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,769
aster has called me when I had a meeting

00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:38,199
and so then he went off any added native

00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:40,329
calendar integration asterisk so and he

00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:43,509
did I mean he went all out it supports

00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:45,310
exchange ical and count bath right now

00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:47,889
and you can do all kinds really cool

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:50,170
stuff so again with call if call routing

00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:51,550
when you get to control what happens to

00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:54,730
cause him to come in you can check

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,889
calendar status based on that i see i

00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:58,660
see that Russell's in a meeting right

00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,069
now so I'm not going to a cinema call

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,110
good I know he's not there or for

00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:03,699
example you know Russell's calendar says

00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,019
he's out today so I'm going to

00:10:03,699 --> 00:10:06,519
automatically send his call to a cell

00:10:05,019 --> 00:10:08,699
phone not even messing around trying to

00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,569
ring his desk and things like that and

00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:12,339
the same comments that said about

00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:14,709
presence information with with Jabbar

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,829
you can do with a calendar as well you

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:19,209
could have a phone reflect that someone

00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:26,380
is busy based on their calendar you can

00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:29,259
have and yeah president stuff it's cool

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,550
okay and the biggest thing like I said

00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,110
what he wanted to do with it was

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,490
automatically generate calls so you

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,310
could have a calendar as a source of

00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:39,160
data and you could inset asterisk up to

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,600
sit to read events and then make calls

00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,550
out to the attendees for a meeting for

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,899
example and which is really nice for

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:46,810
conference calls especially people that

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:48,699
like you know engineers who don't spend

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:49,959
most of our days in meetings where we're

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:51,939
doing development but what cational we

00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:52,959
have a conference call here there and we

00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:54,160
need to make sure we don't forget it

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,870
well we just had the system

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,830
automatically call us at the right time

00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,660
and that makes it easy

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,550
so that's something that just went and I

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,560
think last week or something but he had

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:05,090
been working out for a little while so

00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,910
pretty excited about it so that was the

00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:09,680
wrong direction call event logging so

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,640
this is a new feature that this is also

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,650
brand-new so it in asterisk for years

00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,860
we've had something called CDRs which

00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:21,530
are called detail records and the way

00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,620
that was designed was you have a call

00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,080
and there's a single record that records

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,700
what happened in that call but as

00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,300
asterisk has evolved into a very complex

00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:34,130
toolkit a single record is far from

00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,070
sufficient to reflect what happens in a

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:38,780
phone call so what we have now in this

00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:41,360
new system is it's not there's not a

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,760
single record for a call it's it's it's

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,380
a it just there's a log of everything

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,820
that happened all the different decision

00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:48,800
points that happen for a phone call and

00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,840
this is really nice for while debugging

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,090
but also for building really nice

00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,040
interfaces so if someone wants to go in

00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:56,600
and look at call logs not only do they

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,600
see that a phone call came in but this

00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:03,020
is an example of one of the digium

00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,240
gooeys it's a call came in this is the

00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:08,030
number it came in on it raining the menu

00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:10,520
it rang this person that person answered

00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:12,260
and talked to them for 44 seconds that

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,420
person made a transfer to this other

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,520
person and then it got hung up and and

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:19,010
so now we have logs that log everything

00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:20,690
that happened which is really exciting

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:25,370
especially for building nice interfaces

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:28,490
that have really good logs another cool

00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,160
thing this is also new is we have what's

00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:34,310
called connected and redirecting party

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:36,380
information support and essentially what

00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:39,290
this is is so if you get a phone call

00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,570
your phone has caller ID on it so you

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,860
see who's calling you and that's a start

00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:45,020
right that's the beginning of your call

00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:46,730
but as I sort of mentioned a second ago

00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,100
calls are more complicated than that

00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,530
it's not I call you and that's the end

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,270
of the story it's I call you and then we

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,800
start transferring each other around and

00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,750
then maybe you go to a conference bridge

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,210
and then maybe you get sent to voicemail

00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:02,720
and then so you to call us a lot more

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,730
complicated and that name a number that

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,860
came in at the very beginning well

00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:08,470
that's not that's not the truth for an

00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,640
entire call so we need to be able to

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,720
control what the phone says on the

00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,160
display just say what

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,779
you're talking to and that was actually

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,990
a lot of work to update that

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:20,180
infrastructure but it's it's more than

00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,949
just there's there's some built-in stuff

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,930
so that as you get transferred around

00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,779
the phones getting updated but what's

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,339
what's really awesome i think is that

00:13:25,779 --> 00:13:30,379
there's really easy interfaces for you

00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:31,639
as the telephony application developer

00:13:30,379 --> 00:13:34,220
to control what's on the phone so if

00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,139
you're building a script for routing a

00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:39,620
call or handling it you can control it

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:41,240
so say if you built I don't know say a

00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,610
custom menu you can start updating the

00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,019
display to say what menu you're at or

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,480
something you could really abuse it in

00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:49,819
interesting ways so now you have really

00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:51,860
easy ways to control the name and number

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:56,990
fields on the display on phone to make

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,279
it short and that's cool new bridging

00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,079
infrastructure and so now we're getting

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,459
a little bit lower level but one of the

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,430
things that recently got done was

00:14:01,459 --> 00:14:06,439
ripping out how calls come in and the

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:08,300
bridging calls together essentially so

00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:09,529
you know my phone your phone his phone

00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:12,709
whatever and now we're all talking to

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:14,959
each other so that's bridge the only way

00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:16,610
that we had previously for doing

00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:19,189
bridging of more than two people

00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:20,660
together was using a kernel interface

00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:23,389
that we also distributes but that was

00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,699
specific to Linux and it's a little bit

00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,829
additional install burden but now we

00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:29,629
have new infrastructure that uses you

00:14:27,829 --> 00:14:31,579
know newer interfaces and such and it's

00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:32,959
all in user space and we don't require

00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:36,290
the colonel interface for conferencing

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,509
anymore and if your C programmer it's a

00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:41,000
it's a really easy API to use to start

00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:43,459
so if you wanted to write still

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,750
low-level applications and c2 or

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:46,670
interacting with channels and bridging

00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,930
them together and stuff it's a really

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:53,480
nice interface where we didn't actually

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:57,920
have one before correct that's that

00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:00,259
that's exactly right so and it's it's

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:04,040
it's more than just a asterisk one six

00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:06,079
two so and it's more than just a ZT

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,199
dummy right so it's it's zap tell or

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:11,360
dottie as its name now we we used that

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,160
Colonel interface for all of the mixing

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,930
I mean it was more than just timing it

00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,089
was the conference mixing itself we had

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:18,769
we sent all the audio down in the kernel

00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:20,630
and got all mixed and sent back to us so

00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:22,000
I mean all of the hard conferencing

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,750
stuff was down in the kernel and we've

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,760
rewritten it

00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:31,430
it's a completely new interface yeah

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,140
thanks and the people that don't use

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:38,600
links really happy but going to talk

00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:40,910
about that was this is linux fest okay a

00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:42,320
distributed event system this is

00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:45,890
something that I've kind of worked on

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:48,650
off and on for a while one of the

00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:50,270
challenges of asterisk and if you look

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,480
at some of the history of how asterisk

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,790
was developed it was very much a one

00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,520
system thing it's it's a monolithic

00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:00,080
application on one box I mean mark wrote

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,430
it because he needed a phone system for

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,550
his business so I wrote it was an

00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,810
application that ran on one box but

00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:08,570
asterisk is being pushed into bigger and

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:10,010
bigger environments I mean large

00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,870
enterprises I mean places that are

00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,960
handling many thousands of calls at the

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:17,090
time at a time and so one box doesn't

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,770
quite cut it anymore you need so getting

00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,050
into clustering and things like that and

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:23,480
so now how so we're looking at different

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,860
ways to have asterisks servers talk to

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,890
each other and share information so they

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:30,500
can work together on things and so what

00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:32,480
I have what I've written is a its

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,580
generic infrastructure for distributed

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,660
events is asterisk servers being able to

00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:37,550
tell each other that stuff has happened

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,010
and then being able to act on them and

00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,690
probably the most useful thing that you

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:44,750
can do today based on that system is

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,490
sharing device state so when I pick up

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,140
my phone and make a phone call the

00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:49,940
server that's handling that knows that

00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,410
I'm on a phone call but the other eight

00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,670
servers and the cluster for example

00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:58,580
don't but they need to know because

00:16:54,670 --> 00:17:00,650
safer if your phone is on a different

00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,540
one and your phone has a little light

00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:04,069
that tells you if I'm busy or not that

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:05,990
server needs to know that I'm busy so it

00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,400
can make your light turn on so it's like

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:11,060
a whole lot of work to make lights turn

00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,350
on right but I'm it but that's the it's

00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,520
what we have to do to get these servers

00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,839
to work together and know the

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,310
information so that's what happens now

00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,860
is you can have a cluster of servers

00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:21,290
sitting in Iraq and calls can hit any of

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:25,130
them and all the servers now know about

00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:27,100
those those state changes and can and do

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:29,210
all the things that they normally did

00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,970
based on information even though it's

00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,380
not the same box and that same system

00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,230
can be used for voice mail as well it's

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,580
another example is just maybe you have

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,720
only one server that a no

00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,550
your voicemail but you have another

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,800
dozen that's handling that are handling

00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:46,130
calls that are not voicemail for example

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:48,200
you want the light that turns on when

00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:49,580
your message waiting when messages are

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,870
available to turn on even though the

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:52,430
voicemail isn't on the sandbox is your

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,870
call and so that's part of it so the

00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:56,870
voicemail server knows the state of your

00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:59,750
mailbox and it informs the rest of the

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:02,270
cluster about that state again lots of

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,740
work to make a light turn on or change

00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:08,330
the dial tone if you're using an analog

00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:09,980
phone that's exactly right I mean it's

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:12,350
about managing expectations people have

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:13,400
that people expect their phone to tell

00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,220
them when they have a voicemail they

00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,210
don't care how complicated the server

00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,700
infrastructure is dang it that light

00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:23,750
better turn on so and so we do what we

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:28,600
can to make that happen yes it works

00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:30,860
regards to the voicemail storage sure is

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,490
all right I want to talk about voice

00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:36,170
over IP security for a minute some of

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,090
the things that you do to protect

00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,920
yourself in general with voice over IP

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,170
security or kind of common sense but for

00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,970
some reason and I don't know if maybe

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:45,530
just people are used to telecom being on

00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,470
a different network than the internet

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:52,400
and so they don't take security

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,650
seriously i'm not sure but but but

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,600
there's a lot Boise over IP attacks are

00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:58,250
becoming increasingly common and the

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,920
most common is brute force attacks is

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,810
people scanning for servers offering

00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,160
voice over IP services and then trying

00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:06,680
to make calls out through them so that

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,330
and then people are getting hit with

00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,770
like ten thousand dollar bills because

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,340
if someone started being calls to their

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:15,110
server so this is a huge hit to your to

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,730
your budget if you if you aren't careful

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,800
and the things you do to protect

00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,250
yourself against you know almost all

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,780
this stuff it's pretty easy so general

00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,920
networking stuff and I'm going to talk

00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,900
about firewalling too much that's

00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:29,150
another I'm not an expert there but I

00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,740
mean don't accept calls be careful from

00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:32,150
accepting calls from the world if you

00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:35,750
don't have to accept calls from anywhere

00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:38,450
on the internet then don't excuse me but

00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:40,490
if you do then employ good security

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,080
practices for example using strong

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,930
passwords i would say the number one

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:46,130
problem with people that are getting hit

00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,650
with these big bills because people

00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:50,720
making phone calls is they have their

00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:51,470
system open to the internet they and

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,440
their username and

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,799
passwords or simply numeric so my phone

00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,210
is extension 60 98 at my work and so

00:19:57,799 --> 00:20:00,950
people set up systems like that where

00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:05,780
the user name for the phone is 60 or 98

00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:07,909
and the password is 60 98 okay so what

00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,840
do people do they go and they just do a

00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:11,659
brute force thing where they're just

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,549
scanning for valid user names going just

00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:14,900
numerically and then they scan and they

00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:17,780
try to brute-force the password using

00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,090
numbers and so people break in really

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:26,360
fast using that so don't use numbers

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:29,059
that's it's stupid I mean at least for

00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,360
the password goodness so yeah call

00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:33,950
limits how my phone doesn't need to be

00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:37,250
able to make 200 calls at the same time

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,140
I mean that's kind of so it but by

00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,909
default you know accounts there's no

00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,500
limiting on it yeah well as many as you

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:44,120
want and sometimes you do need that many

00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,440
calls if it's a if it's connections

00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,200
between two boxes to get there for

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,490
example but if it's a phone then put

00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,690
some compliments in place I mean my

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,090
phone doesn't need to do more than like

00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:55,190
three for example if I get really weird

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:56,360
and have a couple people on hold so use

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:58,340
some call limits and that sort of

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,620
reduces the impact if you do get hit I

00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,179
have a link here to a blog post that

00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,100
goes into more detail various

00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:07,520
configuration options that you can do to

00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:10,429
make your system more secure as well and

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:13,360
then so only secure topic encryption as

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:15,950
well use encryption wherever possible

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,299
the EAC's to voice over IP protocol

00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,059
we've had encryption there since

00:21:17,299 --> 00:21:22,909
asterisk 1.4 and I stress 1.6 there's

00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:25,760
encryption of the signaling for sip and

00:21:22,909 --> 00:21:29,480
secure RTP is pretty much done it's

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,549
pending review and more testing and if

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,080
you use the interfaces for like writing

00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:35,000
third-party applications the manager

00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,070
interface for the HTTP interface of

00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:42,890
course SSL is available as we're there

00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:44,720
as well so use it and also on security

00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:47,780
another project that I'm currently

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,650
working on and pretty much done but it's

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:54,980
not merged yet is a so it's a it's a

00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:57,740
framework for having asterisk report bad

00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:00,110
things that are happening so outside of

00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,460
the app to other tools so if for example

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,620
if someone is trying to brute-force your

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,590
system you want to be able to know

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:06,330
that's happening in autumn

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,760
click react react on it so block that IP

00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:10,470
address or whatever and right now some

00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,390
people are doing that with the existing

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,940
log files but the existing logs weren't

00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:16,620
really written with parsing in mind I

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,830
mean they're human readable logs so it's

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:21,120
kind of a messy solution and so I talked

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:24,440
about the event system a few minutes ago

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:28,320
this is built on that same system so

00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:29,880
when voice over IP services are noticing

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,440
that there's lots and lots of failed

00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,150
authentication attempts its reporting

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,279
these things and then you can use that

00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,799
event system to see that it's happening

00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:39,809
and have a tool that reacts on it and

00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,899
there's going to be a log well there's a

00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:44,610
log file as a part of this framework

00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:47,399
that its output it into easily parsable

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:51,630
formats you can write tools that block

00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:52,830
bad people and the coolest feature of

00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,559
all to me is that it's open source

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,090
telephony I mean asterisk and and other

00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:58,890
open source telephony projects have

00:22:57,090 --> 00:23:00,720
turned the industry upside down really i

00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:02,070
mean if you've if you've ever been in

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,200
telephony and looked at any of these

00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:06,330
systems and we're talking crazy amounts

00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,990
of money to buy this stuff and now it's

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,850
free software and so it's really it's

00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:13,559
been a big thing and beyond just the

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,700
cost also the flexibility of what you

00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:23,159
can do with it and that's the best part

00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:27,450
the future reliability is is always been

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:29,309
I guess my number one priority and the

00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:31,640
priority that I put for the team of

00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:34,470
people that I that I work with at digium

00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,980
people have really high expectations

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:40,610
about their dial tone as it turns out

00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:43,830
you know if internet explorer crashes

00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,330
yeah it's like oh yeah duh means

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:46,830
whatever they're just used to it but if

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:48,510
they pick up the phone and they don't

00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,640
get dial tone or they try to make Colin

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,380
doesn't go out i mean that's like you

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,330
know that's the end of the world almost

00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,250
there just people are used to not

00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,500
getting there dial tone and being able

00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,240
make phone calls so that's a big deal

00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,649
for us and we work really hard on making

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,559
sure that our stuff is stable we take

00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:07,230
those issues very seriously scalability

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,120
I mentioned a few minutes ago as well we

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,419
have to be able to take it from one box

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,490
too many and I mean you can do that

00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:16,320
today but we need to make it easier it

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,539
needs to be part of the package it needs

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,090
to be stuff built in

00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:21,499
things that we're working on making the

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,960
developer interface is better and better

00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:25,970
it's not a PBX it's a tool kit so we

00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,549
need to make it easy to use as a tool

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:31,190
kit better API is more flexible easier

00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:32,840
to use and all that kind of stuff one

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:36,139
thing that's taking off more and more

00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,639
video and wideband audio the the audio

00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:41,960
quality only traditional telephone

00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:43,999
network is acetic of well it's 8

00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,919
kilohertz sampling rate but on the

00:24:43,999 --> 00:24:48,739
internet you're not bound to that you

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:50,539
can have higher quality audio so we have

00:24:48,739 --> 00:24:51,859
support for wideband today and we're

00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:55,009
going to be adding more and more support

00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:56,599
for more codecs better codecs as as the

00:24:55,009 --> 00:24:59,749
industry moves in that direction and

00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:02,720
video as well and of course it's an open

00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:04,489
source project I can even though I'm at

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,229
the you know center of this stuff and

00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:07,399
I'm working on it every single day and

00:25:06,229 --> 00:25:09,739
talking to people that are working on it

00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:11,450
stuff always shows up that no clue the

00:25:09,739 --> 00:25:12,710
people were working on I mean just cute

00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,590
like people just show up and say hey I

00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:16,970
rewrote this big subsystem or are out of

00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,960
this huge new feature niche it just

00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,700
stuff shows up whole time and it's

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,729
really fun so who knows where we'll be

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:26,869
in a year to 35 but that's the part of

00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:28,669
the fun and that is where I conclude and

00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:30,799
so from now I have I probably have

00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:33,379
plenty of time for questions and so

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:38,379
let's talk about asterisk back there one

00:25:33,379 --> 00:25:38,379
second yeah

00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:51,050
yeah so the question was I mention that

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,810
we're working on additional codecs and

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:56,410
have I looked at Celt I have and I even

00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:58,400
I've met the guy that they wrote it and

00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,080
we definitely won't support it I mean

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,460
it's you know plan in fact I think he

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,380
was working on adding support for it

00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:04,970
good you know for fun as a project of

00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:06,170
his so i guess i need to catch up with

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,730
them and see how it's coming along but

00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:19,100
certainly it's a codec who would like to

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:20,210
have support for ya to get a question so

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,090
the question was how is the skype

00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:27,410
integration coming along so I'm a backup

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,970
second about I guess I don't know six

00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:31,610
months ago whatever we announced a

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:33,380
project with skype and that in the

00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:35,870
project is adding native support and

00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:38,000
asterisk for skype so it's allowing

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,770
people to call a skype username and that

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,360
you know makes a phone call into your

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,640
asterisk system and the other way around

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,100
as well so you make a call from whatever

00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,450
phone you have through asterisk and

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,760
those calls can go out to the skype

00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:51,290
network journey skype username the

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,130
project is coming along very well in

00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:59,330
fact it works and I and it's been in

00:26:55,130 --> 00:27:02,180
beta for months the thing that's holding

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,250
it up is actually most most than the

00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:06,320
skype side to be honest there's some

00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:08,720
there's some infrastructure that are

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,010
finishing up to get in place so that we

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,720
can launch the product but it works

00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:13,610
great and what and we're using an hour

00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:23,840
for the system you can call the skype

00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:25,340
user digium calls our pbx and so the

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,690
repeat the question it was what version

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:29,300
of asterisk will not be supported in

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:30,740
that's that's a good question I think

00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:35,210
we're going to even have support for for

00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:38,240
asterisk 1.4 I mean as you might guess

00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,370
it's not all open source due to skype

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,320
limitations so it's not going to be

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:44,300
distributed as part of asterisk it'll be

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,860
an add-on but the add-on will be

00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,420
available i'm pretty sure don't hold me

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,640
to it but i'm pretty sure it's for

00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,140
asterisk 1.4 and later so pretty much

00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,890
anything that people would be using

00:27:51,140 --> 00:28:19,280
today from those part did you have

00:27:54,890 --> 00:28:21,920
question no okay yeah okay so the

00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,900
question is about doing a registration

00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:29,780
of a voice over IP client to the server

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:33,650
and how secure is it if you use TLS with

00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,540
sip then it's very secure that's only

00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,250
supported an asterisk 1.6 and almost

00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:41,480
nobody uses it and most clients don't

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:44,900
support it either the authentication

00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,480
method that sip uses is a md5 challenge

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:50,630
response mechanism it's actually really

00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:52,460
easy to brute force that's just the

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,810
truth but it's this isn't this is an

00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,310
asterisk right this is just it this is

00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,350
the industry standard by the way the

00:28:55,310 --> 00:29:00,260
IETF standard this is what everybody

00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:03,260
uses is a very easy to break

00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:05,030
authentication method so your best don't

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:07,520
let it go over unprotected networks if

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:09,770
you want to be really safe I mean it's

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,060
not plain text over the wire I mean if

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:12,560
someone who doesn't really know what's

00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,640
going on downloads Wireshark they're not

00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:15,410
going to see your password and then

00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,990
decoded I mean it's going to be a you

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:20,450
know hash but someone with a little bit

00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:25,880
more clue and who knows what md5 is can

00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:33,740
break it pretty quickly mm-hmm um use a

00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:36,230
VPN or something like that yeah it is in

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:40,400
fact um we just released asterisk one

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:42,740
point six point one when was that I

00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,360
don't know a month ago or something an

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,890
asterisk one point six point zero was

00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,600
released six months ago or something

00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,900
like that so it's it's well on used in

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:53,510
production at this point mmm sure of

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,890
course I mean always do your do your

00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:56,780
testing before you deploy system

00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,310
especially something that people have

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,260
such high expectations for as far as

00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:02,750
reliability goes I always recommend a

00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,400
test setup and a good amount of testing

00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:06,290
for your environment because it is a

00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,820
tool kit we can't I mean we do a lot of

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,430
testing we have a department dead

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,050
testing at digium and we and we do a lot

00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:13,910
like I said we do a lot testing but it's

00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:15,290
a toolkit and we can't test it in every

00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:17,210
way that everyone's going to use it so

00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:18,050
certainly test it for your environment

00:30:17,210 --> 00:30:20,540
and make sure that it does what you

00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:22,100
expected to do but beyond that yes I am

00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:29,990
comfortable saying it's recommended for

00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:35,020
production use any more questions about

00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:35,020
asterisk yes

00:30:56,010 --> 00:31:11,500
sheriff II sure I guess there's a few to

00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:14,560
franchise for that so the question was

00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,960
what about things that for you know a

00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,130
small business selling asterisk how do

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,170
you test those things especially things

00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,390
that require special telco connection

00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,770
then you don't have you know a bunch of

00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:28,150
T ones coming into your office for

00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:30,040
example sure yeah so I guess first of

00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,760
all with bri specifically or any special

00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:35,110
telco connection at least you you do get

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,760
additional support you're not completely

00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:38,980
on your own from the vendor so if you

00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,600
buy a digital card for example we give

00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:42,160
free support for installation and

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,720
configuration and setup and debugging

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:45,100
all that stuff so the upfront stuff to

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,070
make sure everything's working right we

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:49,840
do provide free support for all of that

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,640
second of all like I said with testing I

00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,560
mean for those types of things i would

00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:55,330
recommend scheduling some on-site

00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,800
testing with the customer say yeah i'm

00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,900
going to put a phone system in for you

00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:01,660
but before it goes live to your whole

00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,520
business i need whatever time you think

00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:05,800
some time to put it in at your location

00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,270
and do some testing there to make sure

00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,800
that it does what we think it does well

00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:10,210
that's after-hours over weekend will

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,910
mean whatever works with your customer

00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,610
and then beyond that there are people

00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:17,740
digium and other companies that provide

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,770
that I mean we do asterisk all day every

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:23,230
day and we provide you know higher tier

00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:25,240
support so we like we sell support

00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,650
subscriptions for example so you have a

00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,060
subscription for a year if something

00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:33,480
comes up you get to call us and and you

00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:33,480
also yell at us about it yes

00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:42,740
I mean I don't ever well actually I do

00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:44,870
do I do some development virtual

00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,160
machines but I hear a lot of people

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,990
doing it in virtual machines and getting

00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:52,270
great success and especially with the

00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,270
improvements we've made an asterisk 1.64

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,299
separating the application more from

00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:58,309
Colonel land so we're not requiring

00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:00,020
Colonel interfaces for time being that

00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,490
type of thing that's improving our

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,500
support for virtualized environments

00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,360
even more so lots of people do it and

00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,850
are having great success so that's about

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,669
my only comment for it definitely a

00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:15,590
recommended thing I have no reason to

00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:18,110
shy away from it if anybody has a well

00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,130
for it before ask that if anybody has an

00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:21,679
additional questions for the rest today

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:24,740
feel free to come ask me also up here on

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:27,679
your way out there are some asterisk

00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:29,750
water bottles and some Astros t-shirts I

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,400
asked the marketing people for some

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:37,630
stuff and I got these t-shirts but they

00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:43,970
appear to be all to X so if you want to

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:45,380
sleep in it or are made if you have I

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,290
mean whatever I'm just saying like I

00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:52,220
don't have an assortment really I just

00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:53,510
have to X so feel free to have them I

00:33:52,220 --> 00:34:02,570
don't really want to take them take them

00:33:53,510 --> 00:34:07,460
back so okay you had a question child

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:09,879
support static integrated dynamic

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:13,070
allocation work they're coming up call

00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:16,159
Baylor drops and another possibility all

00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:20,840
support that um okay so the question is

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,929
do we support dynamic integrated t1 so

00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,119
where the fraction of the t1 is its

00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:31,310
voice and data and and the fraction

00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:33,409
between them changes not really yeah

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:36,919
static I mean if it's static so if you

00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:37,760
know half here to be honest I just not

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:41,210
something we've talked about very much

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,649
now I am we have like a whole half of

00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:44,960
engineering that's in charge of the

00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:47,360
hardware stuff and all and and the

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,950
drivers and the interfaces and

00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,170
and all this stuff related to the use of

00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,880
the hardware which is the other guys so

00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:59,960
I'd have to ask them that's something

00:34:52,880 --> 00:35:04,940
they've been talking about but okay turn

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:06,980
it straight into the car yeah right yeah

00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:09,710
so yeah something we have a spectrum

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:12,290
support for as far as what to do about

00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:14,420
it I would recommend we call our sales

00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:16,490
guys and yell I'm not yell bit you know

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,410
express your concern because that's how

00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:19,940
stuff gets done is if customers are

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,470
saying hey this is a problem with me and

00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,510
this is a feature that we could really

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,460
use in my area or whatever then they

00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,870
hear that and that goes into our list of

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:29,750
priorities what we're going to go do and

00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:32,810
and then it'll get done so that's about

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:46,340
the probably the best or Avenue question

00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:49,640
back there is the wall what's my opinion

00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:54,380
on small business off-site phone systems

00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:56,900
I mean it's it's good i think i think a

00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:00,110
lot of people try to do that with a

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,440
cheap internet connection that and then

00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:05,330
they're expecting telco or liability and

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,250
then when they can't make phone calls or

00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,560
the audio is bad because you know

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:11,630
someone started BitTorrent and then the

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:14,390
computer in the back office and whatever

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:19,010
then you know they kind of get with a s

00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:20,210
poor so it's with some with intelligent

00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:25,220
network design i think it's a great

00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:26,600
solution such a short answer and

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,370
obviously tons of people have made

00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,140
businesses doing exactly that with

00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:32,600
asterisk and building their own custom

00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:37,640
interface on top of it and so pretty big

00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:40,840
business all right well I guess that's

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,840
everything thanks a lot guys
