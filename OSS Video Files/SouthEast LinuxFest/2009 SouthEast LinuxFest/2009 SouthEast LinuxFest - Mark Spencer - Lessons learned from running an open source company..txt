the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,540
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,290
southeast linux fest in Clemson South

00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:12,090
Carolina on June 13th 2009 for more

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:15,330
information about the southeast linux

00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:23,010
fest visit southeast linux fest org

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:26,490
I am so just a quick hands I haven't

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:30,599
asked the question yet how many guys

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:34,590
have used asterisk before that's pretty

00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:40,469
good okay and pigeon or game yeah that's

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:44,570
kind of my figure and lttp d even why

00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:49,800
are you seriously he's making it up wow

00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:51,030
that's pretty well okay so I took me a

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,160
while to come up with a name for this

00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,199
presentation but Russell suggested

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,170
template 2 since that was the filename

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,140
of what I had to start from so template

00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:06,180
2 or also lessons learned from running

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,310
an open source company and as usual I

00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:11,880
kind of came up with this one last night

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,979
so it's I don't know why but I kind of

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,840
thought maybe I would try to build it

00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,619
based on Monty Python's meaning of life

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,900
you might seen that movie before okay in

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,310
my raise hands have you seen it ok so at

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,710
least some of the people will understand

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,630
so why it is I took each part of the

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,759
movie and then I tried this somehow

00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,119
correlated to running an open source

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,909
company so it's kind of it kind of works

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:41,400
in some areas maybe not so much and some

00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:45,290
others but we'll just see how it goes so

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:47,579
part 1 miracle birth so if you want to

00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,890
start a company I should say by the way

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,750
this is going to be probably less of a

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,780
technical presentation and more about

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,640
you know what it's like to try to be an

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,689
entrepreneur and maybe some hints about

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,320
how to get started

00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:03,210
Russell is doing a presentation over in

00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:04,880
the other ballroom right after this one

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:07,829
that's going to be oh it's in this one

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,899
and the theater downstairs ok and that

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:12,900
will be a technical discussion on

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,650
asterisk so if your technical you'll

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,150
probably want

00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:20,730
is more than more than mine but anyway

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:22,470
first of all you do need to kind of know

00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,720
something about what you want to do or

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,459
at least what you want to start to do

00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,780
and and that means really kind of have

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,519
some kind of purpose for what you want

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,129
to do and your business you want to

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:35,640
start out with in case of Digium the

00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:37,379
company behind the asterisk the original

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,560
purpose was actually to provide Linux

00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,120
tech support so I had made a tech

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,040
support website called Linux support

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,650
dotnet I don't know if any of you guys

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,609
had ever seen it but I decided I would

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:53,459
try to commercialize that my strategy

00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:55,139
was going to be to get contractors that

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,680
were kind of all around the country to

00:02:55,139 --> 00:02:59,760
be able to work on doing links tech

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,650
support that would just be kind of like

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,549
a clearinghouse for getting questions

00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:07,950
over to people and right from the start

00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:10,739
started an LLC kind of made the business

00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:13,439
so that it could it could really operate

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,139
and I definitely encourage you guys when

00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,000
you start out start with with creating a

00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,340
real entity if you're gonna go build the

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,810
business to keep yourself protected and

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:25,139
to make things easier for you as you go

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,849
down the way down the road now the other

00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:28,859
side of that is don't feel like you have

00:03:26,849 --> 00:03:31,470
to know everything about what you're

00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:32,639
doing that is to say don't feel like you

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:34,319
have to do things the same way other

00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,629
people did and don't feel like you have

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,340
to plan everything out to the finest

00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:41,220
detail because things are going to

00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,540
change and you want to know kind of how

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,690
to start but you want to keep an open

00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,879
mind towards what the situation really

00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:54,000
is in the world and adapt what you're

00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:57,720
doing to what what is demanded in the

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,310
case of did you I really know any money

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,810
to get started so you know put my own

00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,729
pieces together and put my own website

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,560
together all the things you would

00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:07,109
normally do except one of the things is

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,000
I needed a phone system and I decided to

00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:11,400
put my own phone system together right

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,599
so that was kind of pick your battles

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,639
than you're built by decisions

00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,549
I probably tended to build a lot more

00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,250
than maybe was practical but in the end

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:22,229
it ended up working out well because

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:24,029
last point here you probably won't end

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:25,800
up doing what you started out to do and

00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:27,210
even though we started out to do Linux

00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,539
tech support

00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,009
fast forward a couple of years and tech

00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:34,770
supports an easy business to get into

00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:38,759
but it sucks it's really really painful

00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:40,289
at times and what we found was that

00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:41,940
people were more interested in this open

00:04:40,289 --> 00:04:44,430
source phone system called ass first

00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:46,319
that we had created than they were in

00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,360
the actual links tech support business

00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,340
which actually worked out well because I

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,650
was much more interested in writing

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,400
software and asterisk then I was in

00:04:52,650 --> 00:05:03,690
providing technical support to customers

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:06,150
over the phone and over the web so that

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:09,360
brings us to part two growth and

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,690
learning one of the most critical things

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,520
is to try it to find and engage

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:19,110
different mentors so people that have

00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:20,880
founded successful companies tend to get

00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:22,289
in this mode where they feel like they

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,199
have all this knowledge they can try to

00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,060
share with other people and you should

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,069
just just kind of soak it up as much as

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,750
you can and talk to other successful

00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:32,220
people some people that have been

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,530
successful with the companies and maybe

00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,360
some that whose companies failed and

00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,699
just kind of hear what a lot of people

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,409
have to say about it

00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,180
you're gonna get a lot if you talk to a

00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:43,860
dozen different successful entrepreneurs

00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:45,750
you're gonna get a dozen different

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,300
answers for what you ought to do to be

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:52,800
successful and I'm absolutely just one

00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,240
of those so but you as as the the

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,070
entrepreneur as the person that's

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,050
getting started you have to kind of

00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:59,400
homologate all that together and figure

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,199
out how it applies to what you're doing

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,479
and to some degree that even goes for

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,650
small startups where you may not be the

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,440
founder but you're someone that's

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,500
playing the you know a big role in

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,960
what's going on with the company

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:17,940
secondly remember that you are working

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,630
for your customers and for your

00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:23,729
employees so as you start to you know I

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,979
ask people sometimes why do you want to

00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:27,180
go start a business and some people say

00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:29,690
well because I don't want to work for

00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,759
anybody else and that's just just a

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:35,310
terrible terrible attitude damn because

00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:38,190
you will be unemployed very quickly if

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,320
you do that because you do work for your

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:41,009
customers and for your employees that is

00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,050
to say

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,990
that you know the customers are the

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,759
people that are giving you money and you

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:50,009
have to do things for them that they

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:53,669
want that they choose to pay you money

00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:58,559
for and you have to you know satisfy

00:06:53,669 --> 00:07:00,419
their level of really I guess their

00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,949
demand of what they want out of you in

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,830
terms of quality in terms of

00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:06,749
responsiveness you know if you work for

00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:08,279
somebody they kind of have to go through

00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:09,930
a lot of effort to get rid of you but

00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,599
all the customer has to do is stop

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:14,039
writing a check right and that's it it's

00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:15,509
done then they don't have to have a

00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,180
reason they just decide they don't like

00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:19,770
doing business with you so really

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:22,919
remember that and the other half of that

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:24,689
is that you work for your employees so

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,360
when you bring people into the company

00:07:24,689 --> 00:07:30,990
when you get to the point that you need

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,449
help remember that a lot of what you do

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,599
is going to decide whether or not those

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:38,580
people are going to stay and continue to

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,339
work for you whether you know what kind

00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,050
of quality of output you're going to be

00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:45,240
able to get out of people are they

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,709
enjoying their job and trying to make

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,479
the company successful or are they

00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:50,189
coming in and saying man I hate going to

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,169
work everyday and I'm just staying here

00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:57,240
and so I can find something else that I

00:07:52,169 --> 00:08:01,169
can go do and then you've got to

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,159
maintain balance so most you know my

00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:05,039
background has always been as a

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:08,309
technologist so when I created game for

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,529
example there wasn't any business model

00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:11,969
behind it and there really wasn't any

00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:15,149
business model behind asterisk other

00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:18,419
than being a cheap PBX for us to use at

00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:20,430
Digium but eventually you know if you're

00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:23,939
building a business you have to be able

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,999
to maintain some kind of balance between

00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:28,649
the technology you're creating and

00:08:25,999 --> 00:08:31,259
turning that technology into a business

00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:33,539
it's not enough to just say hey I've got

00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:34,620
this cool technology you've got to

00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,839
figure out how are you going to find

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,209
customers what your customers going to

00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,279
pay what does it cost you to make it you

00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:42,389
know what is required in terms of

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,329
delivering it what are their

00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:48,889
expectations you know is there a channel

00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:51,959
or their resellers you know what is your

00:08:48,889 --> 00:08:53,339
how much are you going to burn to get to

00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:54,390
where you're you're trying to be

00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,860
profitable you know

00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:57,840
all these other factors these sort of

00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,170
business factors and by the way I had

00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,090
absolutely none of that when I started

00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:07,260
like support services right so I had

00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:09,570
zero business knowledge acumen and you

00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:12,660
that and to a great degree the fact that

00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,790
we're even still here is is a factor of

00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,420
just being at the right place at the

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:20,430
right time because it was like it didn't

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,110
matter what we did people just wanted to

00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,850
buy it in the early days it's not like

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,800
that now you we really have to work at

00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:29,610
it now but in the early days there was

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,520
just I mean there was there was a total

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,720
dearth of stuff in this field that we

00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:37,140
were in in terms of open source

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,940
communication and we had so many early

00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,130
adopters people that would you know buy

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,720
the products you know it works on my box

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:46,950
that's good enough for me

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,060
handed to me you know so yeah I'll talk

00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,060
probably a little bit more about that

00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:01,650
it's kind of a little out of order but I

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:04,050
had to follow the movie so this is so

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,550
this is this is really not the order I

00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,500
would put these things in but okay

00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:10,970
fighting each other it's kind of

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,040
afterwards after this okay

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:15,870
understands the importance of of what

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:18,060
OSS is right what is open-source

00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,490
software this is a model for how you

00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,350
develop software right and it can be a

00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:26,850
marketing model in the asterisk world

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:28,470
the fact that asterisk was open source

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,200
that people could download it they they

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:34,110
customized it allowed us to get into

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,820
markets all around the world that we

00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:38,340
would never have otherwise been able to

00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:40,380
get into we actually do about half our

00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:42,270
business outside the US and we're based

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,500
in Huntsville and with the exception of

00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:49,110
one twenty-one year old sales guy that

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:52,230
runs all around the world has a passport

00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,870
about that thick we don't really have

00:10:52,230 --> 00:11:01,230
any employees outside the US that are

00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:03,330
representing the company so it's a to

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,430
get there has involved the fact that we

00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,900
were open-source it got us into two

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,070
businesses that were able to download

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,840
the software and try

00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,370
and then contact us when they needed

00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,760
help rather than us trying to go out

00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:17,190
there and find them I mean just as an

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,620
example you all heard of BT British

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:22,320
Telecom so they actually had a

00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:27,270
conference about open-source telephony

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:30,600
and you know we would have had no way to

00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,160
just call up BT and say hey by the way

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,350
we have this open-source phone system

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,640
for you you know you don't even know

00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,860
where to start but because they were

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,140
able to access that software they got it

00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,450
and then contacted us with what their

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,120
needs were so it it's a really great

00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:47,790
development and marketing model but it

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,490
is not a business model okay open source

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:52,890
by itself you know people ask me how do

00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,690
you make money giving away free software

00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:57,120
and the answer is very easy you don't

00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,340
okay there's nothing about giving away

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,800
free software that inherently gets you

00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,770
money right it is all about selling

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,750
products services you know packaging

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,640
whatever it is that customers want all

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,410
that is just traditional business you

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,870
have to have something that people want

00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:15,990
to pay you for and that is how you build

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:19,050
the business and so you know OSS has its

00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:20,460
own sort of things associated with that

00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:25,110
but just have to kind of remember what

00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:27,480
its role is another thing and this may

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,280
seem really obvious but you'd be blown

00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,780
away sometimes that how many companies

00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:33,480
are open-source companies and don't

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,340
leverage open-source internally okay

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,560
open source is a competitive advantage

00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,820
that sets you apart so when you are

00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,530
competing with other companies in

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:44,670
whatever fields when we compete with

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:47,660
Cisco or via you know open source is a

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,340
huge competitive advantage for us in

00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,530
certain sets of accounts and other kinds

00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,610
of accounts that can be actually

00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,960
something where you have to explain to

00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,060
people what it is because they think

00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,650
that they can't depend on free software

00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,650
you guys are probably are very familiar

00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:04,050
with those arguments but there's a huge

00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:07,020
thing but you need to use open source in

00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,660
your own company too if the only open

00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,400
source product you use is your own that

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:12,990
doesn't reflect well for your customers

00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,490
you know when they come and visit and

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,350
everything you have runs on Windows

00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:18,480
except this one product it's just not

00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:21,260
good you need to you need to be able to

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,400
show that you're also capable of running

00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:24,290
open-source software if you're gonna

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:28,700
convince other people that they should

00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:32,750
be able to to use that and prepare for

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:34,340
the worst you know at when you develop

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:36,950
something like pigeon or game or

00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:38,720
whatever you're just interested in

00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:40,520
seeing people use it you know you don't

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,410
have anything around it but when you are

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,910
building a company and you have people

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:45,950
that are working for you and have mouths

00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:49,130
to feed and families that are dependent

00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:51,740
upon the success of what you're doing

00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:53,870
that is that is different you really

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:57,800
have to think about how am I going to

00:13:53,870 --> 00:14:00,200
get the users of the software to want to

00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:03,080
buy stuff from my company how am I going

00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,890
to monetize and support what I've been

00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:09,920
doing it's actually kind of funny just

00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:12,070
as a side here when I went to school at

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,450
Auburn which is kind of like like a

00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:17,660
clone of Clemson I don't know if any of

00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:19,270
you guys have ever been to offering yeah

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:21,800
do it

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,660
Auburn did I don't know I'll say my

00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,030
friend did I think they had a coach that

00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,340
started at Auburn and then came to do

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,240
the thing in Clemson so I'll Sumatran

00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,310
had at first Bell

00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:37,100
I don't really know anyway I actually

00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,800
did a phone interview with with

00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:41,870
Microsoft for a job when I was in

00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,030
college and so they asked me about you

00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:46,880
know okay when all of you used and I was

00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:49,070
like wow he's GCC and I developed and

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,830
you know can make my make files all this

00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,750
kind of stuff and gtk and all that so I

00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:56,390
took all those notes and the last

00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,860
question she asked me on the phone was

00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,480
if you could write your own Job

00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,630
Description at Microsoft what would it

00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:02,360
be

00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:06,500
and I said keep in mind by the way this

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:09,940
is like 1998-99 I said I'd like to write

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,940
free software for Linux

00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:19,660
and there was this silence at the other

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:21,069
end of the phone and then she said well

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:26,669
I'll see if we have anyone working on

00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:31,029
that and then I got my rejection letter

00:15:26,669 --> 00:15:32,769
but that you know that is what I have

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,409
endeavored to actually do here with

00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:37,329
Digium is not only to be able to write

00:15:35,409 --> 00:15:40,239
free software for Linux but to be able

00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:42,009
to employ other developers and to

00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:46,689
encourage an entire community to develop

00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:48,399
free software for Linux but you have to

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:49,989
understand I mean when I created

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,909
asterisk I didn't have any vision of any

00:15:49,989 --> 00:15:54,249
of that right the company had nothing to

00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:57,939
do with telecom that was just not what

00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:59,709
we did it was a project that you know I

00:15:57,939 --> 00:16:01,299
wrote and I was interesting just like

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,189
just like pigeon game and pigeon you

00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:04,569
know here it is I'm happy to contribute

00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:07,839
this out I hope this is helpful for

00:16:04,569 --> 00:16:11,559
people when dollar signs start getting

00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:14,379
involved then there are some can be some

00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:17,379
emotionally taxing moments for you in

00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:18,399
particular when things really start to

00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:21,399
get big and you start getting

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,979
competitors that are actually selling

00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,470
the same services and products and

00:16:23,979 --> 00:16:29,319
things like that in competition with you

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,899
using the very software that you have

00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:33,519
created right I mean it's one thing when

00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:35,019
people use the software and hey I

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,879
downloaded asterisk and it's working

00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:38,229
great and I'm making a ton of money but

00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,579
I don't really need to buy anything from

00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:41,619
you but thanks anyway

00:16:39,579 --> 00:16:43,899
you know I mean that's fine you know you

00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:45,759
get used to that but it's really hard

00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,109
emotionally when you're attached to a

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,970
project right because I mean when you

00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:50,589
develop open source you're rarely

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,639
developing it just because it's your job

00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,429
right it's something you're passionate

00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,959
about and you have to understand that if

00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:57,279
you turn it into a business it's

00:16:55,959 --> 00:17:00,609
something that you're going to run into

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,829
is where you're competing with the very

00:17:00,609 --> 00:17:07,809
software that you have created either

00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:10,259
directly or indirectly and this is the

00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:10,259
middle of the presentation

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,610
again if you've seen the movie this

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,350
would make sense if not probably not

00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:23,819
okay part for the middle years okay so

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,720
this is really the one I probably would

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:30,870
have put first know when to delegate it

00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,510
is when you first start out and it's

00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:35,910
just you it is important that you know

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:38,070
how to like let things go and the

00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,960
easiest things are first of all the

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,440
things that you both aren't any good at

00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,809
and don't like doing okay those are the

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,080
easiest to get delegated to somebody

00:17:45,809 --> 00:17:51,780
else right and then you have the things

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,390
that either you do enjoy doing or that

00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:56,309
you aren't really all that bad at to

00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:58,590
delegate away and those are a little bit

00:17:56,309 --> 00:18:00,210
more challenging and then the third

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:04,169
thing the hardest the really the hardest

00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:05,970
one is when you get to the size that

00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:08,700
there are things that you're good at and

00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,919
you enjoy doing but you just don't have

00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,600
the time to do all of them and you still

00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:14,159
have to delegate those away and that can

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,950
be very challenging but you have to at

00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:22,830
some point be willing to do that you

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,169
need to hire people when you do that

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:26,880
delegation that you can trust you can't

00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:28,740
get people and then constantly be

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,140
looking over their shoulder so for

00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:35,250
example when I hired my first sales guy

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:37,320
at Digium first of all that was a huge

00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:40,440
breakthrough by the way like when you

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:42,870
have one person whose job is just to go

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:44,610
out there and sell it is amazing what

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:46,530
that does to how much money comes in

00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:48,780
that is not something to be multitasked

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:52,740
that is someone needs to be focused on

00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,809
that job but anyway when I did so it was

00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:57,510
important that anything that had to do

00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,340
with selling was spoken with one voice

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,320
that meant that if someone came to me

00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,990
and said hey I want to get this special

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,750
deal or whatever that it always had they

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,760
whatever the answer was had to come from

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:10,260
Greg our sales guy and I might talk to

00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,000
him and ask him and say hey this person

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:15,419
came to me what do you think about this

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,830
or whatever but always let the people do

00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:20,370
their jobs and if you think they're

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,840
doing a good job then you know you've

00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:24,210
got the right person in place and let

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,340
them do it and if you don't like the job

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:29,640
doing don't try to change what they're

00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:31,680
doing just get you know if they're not

00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,300
the right person that you feel

00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,920
comfortable with get someone in there

00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:38,100
that is the right person but it's gotta

00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,510
be you know in order to delegate that's

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,830
got to be people that you can trust them

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:43,800
that you can work with and you got to

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,930
let them do their jobs and be prepared

00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,630
for the challenges of having coworkers

00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,610
so office drama starts when you have

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,110
three people because then you have two

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,850
people that can talk about the third

00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:56,640
without them being there and that's

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:59,610
really all you need so just be be

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:04,200
prepared that things will kind of start

00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:05,640
when you have when you have three and to

00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,100
some degree when you get more people

00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:11,100
you're gonna start losing visibility

00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:12,420
into everything that is going on so I

00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,740
tell people a lot of times that's

00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:15,330
starting a company is probably a lot

00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,990
like what raising a child is like at

00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:20,510
four years you might know 90% of what's

00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:23,310
going on your four year olds life and

00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,780
and you know you're trying to make them

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:29,130
be the person you think that'll be and

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:30,390
it's a 16 or 18 or 19 maybe you know 10%

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,010
of what's going on in their life and

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:33,660
they are absolutely their own person and

00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:35,880
you try to kind of interact with them

00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,570
but you have to understand that you know

00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:41,340
they're not the thing they're not just a

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,200
person that you're trying to make be you

00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:46,650
they are really their own person at that

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,860
point evaluate capitalization

00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:52,350
requirements so this is one area where I

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,180
differ from a lot of of other companies

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,830
a lot of companies think you should go

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,500
out and try to get you know venture

00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,600
capital early on and it is kind of easy

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,920
because you know if you get you know

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,260
there's nothing quite as easy as

00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:11,600
spending other people's money I mean it

00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:11,600
really is just a lot easier do it yeah

00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:20,490
thanks but I actually think you should

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,530
bootstrap the company as long as

00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,900
possible trying to get to the point as

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,570
early as you can that you are selling a

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,520
product and making money because whether

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,680
it's venture capital or loan or whatever

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,890
else you need to be able to grow an

00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,960
expand your company you know people only

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:41,340
want to give you money when you don't

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,780
need it and venture capital is a totally

00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,580
different experience if you're a

00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,340
profitable company that doesn't really

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:50,010
need the venture capital then it is if

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,780
you are desperately needing it because

00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,130
you know you if you don't get money

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,680
you're not going to be able to continue

00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:58,350
for two or three more months so it's

00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,810
it's real important to in my mind to try

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:05,870
to get that that business going

00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:09,180
we actually got to venture capital in

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,460
2006 and I'll probably tell you a little

00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:13,800
bit about that when we get to this last

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:17,880
one so this is this last one that is one

00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:20,070
that I really didn't do very well in the

00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,170
beginning in fact I would say I had to

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:25,620
make a very discreet kind of change here

00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:27,300
but build infrastructure as needed right

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,930
again this comes back to I didn't have

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,660
any business knowledge right so I just

00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:36,810
kept growing the business just like it

00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:40,040
was a small business and I ran the

00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:44,130
company as as president until January of

00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:47,640
2007 and let me try to explain where

00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:50,520
things were in January of 2007 we were

00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:53,510
about 80 people we had been profitable

00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:56,760
for five years with growth every quarter

00:22:53,510 --> 00:23:01,040
we had never and I mean never had a

00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:03,540
budget of any kind nothing not even like

00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:05,940
percentages or anything

00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:08,430
we had what I would call flower shop

00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:10,530
financials so I could tell you like what

00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:12,600
we spent on travel last year and I could

00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:13,680
tell you what we spent on rent but I

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,150
couldn't tell you what we spent on

00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,950
marketing I couldn't tell you what we

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,050
spent on the engineering every time

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:20,520
somebody wanted something right they

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,810
would bring a little purchase rack and

00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,600
explain what it is that they wanted to

00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,179
get and I

00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:26,590
you know yeah okay that's fine or go see

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:28,630
if you can find a cheaper alternative or

00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,830
whatever they had no idea how much they

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:31,750
were gonna get to spend in the year

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,730
right and that worked fine when you were

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,100
a small company but when you get you

00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:39,070
know 80 people things start really

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,890
getting difficult at that point right I

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,169
had 13 people that directly report it to

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,789
me plus all the engineers because we

00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:48,010
didn't have any engineering management

00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:49,660
at all and we didn't have a product

00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,220
quality department or anything so

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:57,100
engineers would test their own stuff and

00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:59,679
then we chip it and you know if you

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,710
start this a little earlier than it is a

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,470
lot easier to make the transition from

00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:08,200
doing that to having a you know more

00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:09,940
traditional build cycle and you know the

00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,710
stuff you mean to be able to convince

00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:15,520
bigger customers that you can reliably

00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:18,220
produce product we actually did the ISO

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,330
9001 recently which wasn't nearly as bad

00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,000
as I thought it was going to be only

00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:24,580
took a few months and and nobody ever

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:29,559
needed to talk to me so that was all I

00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:32,289
needed but if you can at least get

00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:34,659
enough infrastructure in place to where

00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:37,809
you know you kind of know where you're

00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:40,690
spending that you can kind of make plans

00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:41,950
going forward about you know what kind

00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:44,799
of numbers you need to see coming into

00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:47,169
the world I managed going out and try to

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,909
get some people involved in the company

00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:51,460
that have actually had business

00:24:48,909 --> 00:24:54,580
experience before you could go in if you

00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,650
don't have any business experience you

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:58,390
can still work with people hire managers

00:24:56,650 --> 00:25:01,840
that do have business experience and

00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:03,100
probably be successful but you or you

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,200
can have a lot of business experience

00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:09,010
and you can you know grow a lot of that

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,870
management base but you can't know

00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:12,250
nothing about business and hire a bunch

00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:14,559
of other people that know nothing about

00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:17,650
business and then you know that that's

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,600
just really hard to make work so build

00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,950
it out as needed and that kind of to

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,960
some degree also goes for your physical

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:24,909
infrastructure you know you want to have

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,140
enough space to be able to grow into you

00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:29,110
don't want to have to move every two or

00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,400
three months and you want to have you

00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:33,780
know good enough networking and stuff

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,780
for people be successful

00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:40,740
all right live organ transplants I have

00:25:38,370 --> 00:26:11,549
nothing I really can

00:25:40,740 --> 00:26:14,100
yeah yeah so we we had chaos okay well

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:16,019
we started with chaos and then we tried

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:21,350
to organize the chaos to some degree and

00:26:16,019 --> 00:26:21,350
that's probably about no it's much less

00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:29,639
well it depends on again on how you do

00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:32,159
it so we did it in in I guess about two

00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:33,389
thousand five I kind of recognized that

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,190
things were starting to get bigger than

00:26:33,389 --> 00:26:37,529
I was going to be comfortable doing and

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,659
I elected to bring in a venture capital

00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:42,179
person to help me build a management

00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:43,799
team for the company and that decision

00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:45,210
was largely based on you know I've

00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,799
always had this thought that you want

00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:51,090
everybody kind of bought into the same

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:54,600
goal and a consultant no offense or

00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,159
anything but noted a good job and by no

00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,710
means but a consultant doesn't really

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,659
have any like plus or minus as to

00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,120
whether his work is successful or not

00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:05,190
but if someone is invested in the

00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,960
company then they absolutely have a

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,700
reason for you to be successful so I

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,909
wanted someone involved that was

00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:14,309
invested in a company and we found one

00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:16,980
particular venture capital firm where

00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:18,419
the guy was all about how to build the

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,960
business you know knew how to hire the

00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:23,879
management team knew how to you know get

00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,460
the right people to know how to set up

00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:27,960
you know forecast for production and all

00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,509
that kind of stuff that we really needed

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,929
to be able to be successful

00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:35,549
and so that's the route that we went and

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:38,429
then in January about seven I actually

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:40,559
got to hire my old boss Danny Wyndham

00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:41,929
who was the president of another company

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,090
called ad Tran that was in

00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:47,059
where I had been a co-op student and I

00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:50,389
had him come over and be the CEO of

00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,220
Digium and then he had was then tasked

00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:54,259
with creating all the infrastructure

00:27:52,220 --> 00:28:00,289
that I had neglected for the previous

00:27:54,259 --> 00:28:02,869
five years so that was kind of how we

00:28:00,289 --> 00:28:04,999
did it if in retrospect I would say

00:28:02,869 --> 00:28:07,759
you've got a if you can do it a little

00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:11,600
more smoothly sort of add people as you

00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:13,730
as you can get people that are that are

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,679
not just qualified to do the job today

00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,820
but it's qualified to do the job where

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,740
you think you're going to be in a year

00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:24,080
or two now it's one of the hard things

00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:25,369
to understand is that you know you have

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,809
people that are small company and keep

00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:28,940
people and you have people that are big

00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:30,710
company people and not all the people

00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,269
that you hire and that first-time are

00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:34,490
going to be able to make the transition

00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:36,440
to be a big company it's just some

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,669
people are much better when there's you

00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,769
know a thousand different things that

00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:42,080
have to be done and they want to do a

00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:44,330
little bit of everything but when that

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,330
when the job starts getting more and

00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:48,679
more narrow that they get you know it's

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,879
just not something they enjoy anymore

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:52,159
and you have to understand that's you

00:28:49,879 --> 00:28:54,289
know not everybody is gonna make it that

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,429
whole way and by the same token you know

00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:57,169
there are a lot of people that work at

00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,700
the gym that right now that there is no

00:28:57,169 --> 00:29:00,470
way they would come to work at the gym

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,179
when we were ten people because we

00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,889
didn't you know there wasn't enough

00:29:02,179 --> 00:29:05,749
definition in terms of what job

00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:07,159
functions were or you know you didn't

00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:09,789
have enough work for someone that was

00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:12,080
really specialized in particular area so

00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:15,860
it's just it's something that kind of

00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,080
changes over time but again because it

00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:21,230
was something that was so in demand in

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,450
the market all of these mistakes and

00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,549
lack of structure and all that was

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,049
managed to get swept under the rug for

00:29:25,549 --> 00:29:28,460
years and years and years because there

00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:30,139
was just so much demand for what we were

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,139
doing and nobody else was doing it and

00:29:30,139 --> 00:29:35,210
now you know that was you imagine that

00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:36,769
is not something that sustains forever

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:38,389
that at some point people are going to

00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:40,490
go wow that is a nice business to be in

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:42,830
I'm gonna go into that business and now

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,210
you you know we have to do things really

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:47,509
right we've got to be able to deliver

00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:49,460
product on time you know we have you

00:29:47,509 --> 00:29:50,960
know people we've hired out of the

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:53,179
automotive industry to actually make

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,820
sure that all of our our product

00:29:53,179 --> 00:29:58,310
reliability follows you know very strict

00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,140
to make sure that that we don't get

00:29:58,310 --> 00:30:01,960
returns because if you know you come a

00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:05,540
Janu have our business outside the US

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:09,020
you know in for cards let's say it's a

00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:12,880
$300 card by time you have to ship it

00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:15,320
out and ship it back it's real expensive

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,560
especially outside the US so you really

00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:23,390
want to have great quality the hell

00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:25,220
pains for it okay awesome okay so

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,930
nothing for live organ transplants but

00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:31,340
oh maybe you could describe building out

00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:38,060
that management team it just didn't feel

00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:38,840
quite right the autumn years okay things

00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:44,030
will change

00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:46,130
I think this poem works for politics too

00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:46,970
you know new politicians I'll think

00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:49,910
they're going to be totally different

00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:51,710
from everybody else and people and start

00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:53,420
new businesses are always like man I'm

00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:54,920
gonna be so completely different from

00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:57,320
every other big business and I'm never

00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,970
gonna get stuck in meetings and you know

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:00,650
you can come up dream up with all kinds

00:30:58,970 --> 00:31:02,120
of things that you're going to be

00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:05,870
totally different from everybody else

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:08,480
but at some point you know as you get

00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:10,430
bigger these things slowly it's not all

00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,320
once but just slowly they will tend to

00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:15,020
change because it just the bigger you

00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,230
get the more of this kind of structure

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:19,730
ends up eating into things and it will

00:31:18,230 --> 00:31:22,340
change you just have to be willing to

00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:25,670
accept that I mean Digium you know today

00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:28,160
is a spectacularly fun place to work I

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:33,170
mean we had casual day not long ago and

00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:35,900
had jam sessions and the lobby and you

00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:37,640
know it was just and casual day Digium I

00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,340
should say it's kind of different from

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:42,020
casual day most places this is normally

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,200
how I would go to work

00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:49,900
casual day this time I went in swimming

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,900
trunks and enough floaties

00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,780
and we have people in pajamas you know I

00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,150
mean how many companies do I have to

00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,160
John parties but anyway but still I mean

00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:01,860
it's it's a little different than it was

00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:05,610
you know when we were just 10 people and

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:07,830
after work we'd all go out to bar and

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,450
have an all-nighter where we drink and

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,160
write software you know it's just it's

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,080
not always you know some things we'll

00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,419
have to kind of adapt you know now we

00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,549
have an HR department to argue with

00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:19,890
employees about whether or not they have

00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:21,179
to actually wear shoes at work you know

00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,590
because you get some people just want to

00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,220
walk around barefoot and that wouldn't

00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:28,679
have been an issue before but okay

00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:30,870
anyway as you get bigger and bigger you

00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,400
know not all your co-workers are gonna

00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,710
be able to share your same passion so

00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,809
when we started Digium and we were few

00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:40,590
people I mean everybody was just like

00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:42,809
lived and breathed asterisk all the time

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:44,940
I mean it's just really embedded and

00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:46,200
when you brought somebody in if they

00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:48,480
didn't have that passion there was just

00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:52,380
no way you'd consider it but by the time

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,539
you're 125 people know you can't always

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:56,460
find people that are absolutely as

00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:58,140
passionate as you are about open-source

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,120
software you're gonna get you know

00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:02,190
somebody you need an accountant and

00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:05,340
you're not gonna find an accountant that

00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,990
is just like man asterisk is I go home

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,850
and I play with asterisk on my Linux box

00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:10,140
I mean it's just they're not a lot of

00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,730
those and you have to understand that

00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,620
some people are coming to work because

00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:15,720
that's their job and and they like

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,610
working there but they're not they don't

00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,679
share that same passion and that's a

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,260
that's something that that changes and

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,380
you just have to kind of accept it as

00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:29,429
best you can you want trying to maintain

00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:31,350
your culture again some things it's

00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:33,480
gonna some things just have to change

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:35,549
you can't have it all the same way you

00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,049
know we we had to cut back on the amount

00:33:35,549 --> 00:33:39,900
of alcohol that we had sitting around

00:33:37,049 --> 00:33:41,760
the office you know because again you

00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:45,870
know H I was concerned that with you

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,210
know 16 year old kids and beer in the

00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:51,330
fridge that could potentially be a

00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:53,820
problem so you know they're they're

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:55,380
little things but you focus on kind of

00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,140
what makes you special you know which

00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:59,940
for us was a lot about you know trying

00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:02,040
to have good communication trying to be

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,440
open not only in terms of our software

00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,929
but in terms of

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,909
what we communicate to people so and we

00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:09,980
have monthly townhall meetings where we

00:34:07,909 --> 00:34:11,780
go through you know how our numbers did

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,310
what was our profitability like what are

00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:14,690
the challenges we've got who are big

00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:16,190
customers try to keep everybody in the

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,470
loop and that's a you know that's a big

00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:20,060
part of what our culture is so you kind

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:23,389
of have to pick what you're gonna watch

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:25,790
your gonna battle and as it gets bigger

00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:28,399
you get to enjoy to some degree your

00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:29,929
company's independence so when you when

00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,399
you are first starting a company you

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,980
know you are the cog that makes that

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,500
thing run but when you get bigger when

00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:39,290
you get the size of the gym you know I

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,030
mean I can like disappear for two or

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:42,560
three days to go fly somewhere and then

00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:45,889
come back and everything's still pretty

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,629
much working and you know it you get to

00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:51,980
actually enjoy your life outside of work

00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:54,619
a little bit this is a little bit of a

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,359
kind of a sad story but one of my

00:34:54,619 --> 00:34:58,930
mentors was a Mark Smith who was the

00:34:56,359 --> 00:35:03,920
founder of ad Tran and I remember

00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:06,109
meeting with him in in January or this

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,380
was January February of out of seven it

00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:12,020
was just after Danny had come to work

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,460
and yeah that was kind of a little bit

00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,260
awkward since I've hired the president

00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,260
of his company to come work for me but I

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:23,869
I asked him I said when did you feel

00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,630
like you could kind of let things go

00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:28,880
enough to enjoy what you know what you'd

00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:32,810
made with your life and he thought about

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:36,700
a minute he said way too late and he

00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:39,440
passed away two months after that and so

00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:43,400
you know you've got to kind of be able

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,200
to enjoy things a little bit and and

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,069
that goes for any career really but

00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,990
especially as an entrepreneur and

00:35:48,069 --> 00:35:52,849
understand that you know the like feel

00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:56,089
like a Digium the success the Digium has

00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:57,680
had so far is really the work of many

00:35:56,089 --> 00:35:59,599
many people there's so many people that

00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,569
have played a role in it it's not like

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,150
Digium is this company that that mark

00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:07,849
made its Digium is this conglomeration

00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:10,130
of the effort of hundreds of people

00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:12,410
working together each contributing their

00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,540
part in each reflecting a piece of

00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,970
themselves in what is the culture of the

00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,359
company so you know you've got to kind

00:36:16,970 --> 00:36:19,009
of

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,230
keep all that in mind and enjoy the kind

00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:25,609
of transition that you have as the

00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:29,230
company grows all right and then part

00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,230
seven is death I mean that's kind of

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,779
didn't really want to talk about the

00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:36,950
death of a company but hopefully it's

00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:39,319
not really you know gonna die but you do

00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:41,900
think about what is your long-term goal

00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:43,730
with it so for some people you want to

00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:46,339
have a lifestyle company where you know

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,869
you just kind of draw money from it and

00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:49,670
that's that's great by the way if you're

00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:51,710
gonna do that though don't get venture

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:53,499
capital because venture capital is gonna

00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,329
force you into the bet the farm big

00:36:53,499 --> 00:36:58,160
strategy which is try to grow the

00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:02,420
company into you know something really

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,999
huge and go public or find someone to

00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:06,680
acquire the company and as soon as you

00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:07,460
take venture you are really pushed into

00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,170
this category

00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,730
now we were kind of pushed into this

00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:12,559
category anyway just by the nature of

00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:15,109
where we were they're they're not like

00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:17,259
little telecom companies that make

00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:19,700
products for an entire industry I mean

00:37:17,259 --> 00:37:21,499
we knew that asterisk was either gonna

00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,089
have to be really big or digit was gonna

00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:25,369
have to be really big to be able to

00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:27,440
support asterisk or that somebody else

00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:28,759
would come in and take it over so we

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,480
knew we were gonna have to be in the

00:37:28,759 --> 00:37:34,130
Beth of harm big category but but if

00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,359
you're starting out you don't

00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,920
necessarily have to be in there and

00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:40,549
there's a lot of benefits to that first

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:44,390
one - and that brings me to the end of

00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:46,009
the presentation and so I guess I'll

00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:50,119
reserve the rest of time for questions I

00:37:46,009 --> 00:37:50,690
think we've got about ten minutes so ask

00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:57,489
away

00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:59,809
somebody's gonna I was I was very

00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:01,819
fortunate well I mean the address done

00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:04,160
in two pieces bringing in the management

00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:07,999
team I was really really really lucky

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,859
because I had worked with Danny our CEO

00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:11,749
for years and years he'd been on our

00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:13,369
board representing at tram which had

00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:17,029
bought a little piece of the company or

00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:18,829
earlier on and in that capacity Danny

00:38:17,029 --> 00:38:21,289
was a board member and I really came to

00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:23,569
appreciate what he knew and his

00:38:21,289 --> 00:38:27,410
knowledge and he was never in a position

00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:30,019
of being in a job interview so I knew

00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:31,090
how he really operated so that was a

00:38:30,019 --> 00:38:33,970
very

00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:35,500
very fortuitous thing that that that's

00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:37,960
the route that I could go I think it's

00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:39,160
much harder when you bring in management

00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,020
teams with people that you're having

00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,030
that you know interview and even if you

00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:45,610
haven't been for three or four days I

00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,110
mean when you bring in somebody that's a

00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:49,120
you know chief operating officer or

00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:51,610
something this is not like you know

00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,100
hiring another employee everything has

00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:55,960
to be right personality is incredibly

00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,880
important you've got a when you bring in

00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:59,890
a major in timid it's got to be someone

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,450
that the other people accompany can

00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:06,940
respect that they can work with that

00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:10,350
they can appreciate the harder part is

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,790
really that when you when you do that

00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:14,170
you know there's there's sometimes gonna

00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,300
be people that they want to bring and

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,920
that's just kind of the way it is you

00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,450
need to again when you bring in somebody

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,870
you've got to trust them to do what

00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:24,520
they're going to do and some people if

00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,140
the company are going to be able to make

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:27,940
that transition and some people at the

00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:31,660
company will have a lot of difficulty

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:34,720
making a transition like that the second

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:36,190
thing about control when I brought in a

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:38,920
management team and I brought in venture

00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:40,780
capital I went to great lengths to

00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,570
assure that I would maintain control of

00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:45,520
the board that I would maintain majority

00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:50,290
shares you know all kinds of stuff to

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:52,390
maintain control but the reality is that

00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,760
you're only successful if you can get

00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,920
everybody working together so whether or

00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:58,510
not you have control at the end if

00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:01,570
you're with a team that you really

00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:04,360
respect I mean it's fine but it's not

00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:07,030
it's not that big a deal because if you

00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:10,120
if the if the management team is not

00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:11,380
getting along then it's not gonna be

00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,640
good anyway

00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,860
you you all have to kind of work

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,290
together as a group anyway so that you

00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:18,760
know whether I could you know fire Danny

00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,620
or he could fire me is kind of

00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:22,750
irrelevant because we are we have to

00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,860
work together to have the company be

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,860
able to be successful anyway

00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:41,100
man most creative there's actually a

00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,520
group at New York University which is

00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:49,310
actually in the art departments there

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:53,100
was it the lying and the yeah was it the

00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:56,880
interactive telecommunications something

00:40:53,100 --> 00:41:01,650
IT I keep on and say ITU but I don't

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,480
think that's it anyway they actually are

00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:05,670
essentially a group of artists that use

00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,820
asterisk more or less as a medium for

00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:11,550
doing different kinds of things so they

00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,060
had just some examples there was a guy

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:16,890
that that made a application called eye

00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:18,810
plate you where you could leave messages

00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:21,180
for people based on their license plate

00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,280
numbers and you know if they cut you off

00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:25,800
you could leave some really angry

00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,120
message or you know if you thought

00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,250
they're really hot and you could make a

00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:32,910
you know try to set up a date you could

00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:36,000
do that there was a group that did a

00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:38,580
play in the New York one of the New York

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,430
train stations the Canal Street Station

00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:42,840
so you would call from like this

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:44,460
toll-free number from one of the

00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,680
payphones and it would cover like part

00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,660
of the play that happens in that area

00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,250
and then it would tell you a different

00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,540
paper on that go to and you go to this

00:41:50,250 --> 00:41:53,220
other payphone and then you'd hear

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:59,790
another part that happens in another

00:41:53,220 --> 00:42:01,230
area trying to think do what the tailor

00:41:59,790 --> 00:42:02,730
calls yeah I know they think it's so

00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:04,860
much coverage but yeah there's a group

00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,060
that made a system called patina call so

00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:08,660
that your plants could call you and

00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,660
they're low on water

00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,000
and that was kind of that was one of the

00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:16,290
first really cool apps there was a

00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,910
there's a guy that's got a company doing

00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:19,859
big games so imagine like in a movie

00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,170
theater or screen like this that there's

00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,940
a game on the screen and you call into a

00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:26,010
number with your cell phone and you use

00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,470
your like DTMF digits as like a

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,910
controller for the game so you know you

00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:31,170
might have like a little character or

00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:32,910
whatever and you're moving around a maze

00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:34,200
with your phone and you're competing or

00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:36,210
playing with all the other people that

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:41,760
are in the room all using their cell

00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:43,940
phones to to be able to play I think

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:49,440
those are trying to think of they

00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:51,960
there's the booty dialer which allows

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,609
you to upload your booty call lists and

00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,160
call them in sequence for you and then

00:42:53,609 --> 00:42:58,920
connect you with a first available

00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:01,589
candidate so you know I mean it's it's

00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:05,790
really about applying the technology to

00:43:01,589 --> 00:43:06,750
whatever your needs are and I guess

00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:18,089
there are people that are really just

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:23,000
that busy event no I don't think she did

00:43:18,089 --> 00:43:26,010
but she she did the the voice for the

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,050
thing they had a an asterisk power

00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:29,190
Roomba

00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,470
you know the Roomba the little vacuum

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,930
cleaner so they had like hooked up a

00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:36,420
Linksys router and put asterisk on it

00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:37,770
and then use that to control the Roomba

00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:40,170
so that you could control the room but

00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:43,230
with DTMF and you would be to do like

00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,660
you know you press like four they would

00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:47,520
go you'd hear house and go start sucking

00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:51,060
and then you've got six I'm you're like

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,030
stop sucking so those are probably some

00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:58,440
of the funnier like random prompts I've

00:43:54,030 --> 00:44:00,650
heard her do I don't think I'm done

00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,650
thing

00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:23,680
well telecom generally is a world of a

00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:25,360
lot of coopertition and so it's it can

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,880
sometimes be hard to draw the lines

00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:32,910
between them but it's just a mixture I'd

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,280
say we have more partners and we have

00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:39,870
competitors but some of the competitors

00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:42,040
are really difficult when they try to

00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:45,880
misrepresent things about your company

00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:47,920
you know and because you know it's

00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,850
competition sometimes some people play

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,440
more fair than others and and again it's

00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:56,260
not so much from just the business side

00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,000
but from from the emotional side of

00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:01,150
being hey I went out and created this

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:04,150
this package and now look what people

00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:05,830
are doing you know makes it that's just

00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:09,160
the part that makes it harder more so

00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:22,870
than then directly all the business

00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:25,870
competition no there was nothing non

00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:34,090
pidgin there was no making any money off

00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:35,830
of a pidgin at all right we sell we

00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:37,510
actually sell a subscription which is a

00:45:35,830 --> 00:45:39,670
good model by the way for people to an

00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:41,110
open source because it lets you just try

00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:43,210
to come up with a value and that you can

00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:46,450
kind of lump in that people are buying

00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:47,740
on a recurring basis but we saw a

00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:52,060
subscription around it that includes

00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:53,680
support and updates and I think you get

00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:56,290
some other stuff too like some backups

00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:59,230
and you know day to backup and things

00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:01,360
and then we sell a lot of hardware

00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:04,060
related to asterisk so connecting to the

00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,000
phone system plus people I mean to the

00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:08,860
phone network most people the buy phone

00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,500
systems especially the channel that

00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:13,000
actually delivers phone systems tend to

00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:15,190
want little boxes that they

00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,940
can just put on the wall they don't

00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:22,080
really get this you know take a PC and

00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:28,270
put a card in it and install software

00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:30,040
it's just not what most PBS dealers do I

00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:31,720
mean they're just used to buying a box

00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,730
they put it on the wall and there's that

00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:36,130
price list and learning how to configure

00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:38,260
it and so on so we actually make systems

00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:41,230
that are really just packaging asterisk

00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:44,260
in a dedicated appliance with hardware

00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:47,860
and and you know fancy GUI and so on

00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:49,960
that can be mounted and installed by by

00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,600
dealers and then we go out and build

00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:54,430
kind of a traditional dealer network to

00:46:52,600 --> 00:47:04,990
go out and and sell those products to

00:46:54,430 --> 00:47:07,330
customers yeah to some degree that's a

00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:09,490
good that's a good question so when we

00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:12,070
started asterisk and we made cards and

00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:13,990
we may you know but we never thought

00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,460
about building the whole solution we

00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:22,300
were all about building components when

00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:23,710
we started and that was just a there's

00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:26,890
only so much market that you're gonna

00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:29,830
capture that way and that was the niche

00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:31,420
that we started in and then now we were

00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:33,390
going after much broader market which

00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,340
demands kind of put together solution

00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:38,560
and they value things differently the

00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,390
the market when we sold our cards in

00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,300
that and to you know people that are

00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:44,860
just you know end-users those and users

00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:46,720
have to be sophisticated they care about

00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,770
open source they you know they want to

00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,180
support the project

00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:50,620
you know they know what they're doing

00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,470
supporting them is very different from

00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:55,150
what it is to support you know a

00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,620
reseller doesn't know anything about

00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:58,690
Linux doesn't care anything about open

00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:01,960
source you know that's just a whole

00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:03,280
different kind of ballpark and so you

00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,840
know there's a lot of new infrastructure

00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,730
to be able to go support that so now we

00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,200
really redo both of them but that was

00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:11,950
really a niche that we kind of started

00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:14,520
in and I think we've got about ten

00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,520
minutes left

00:48:53,290 --> 00:49:02,690
okay I've only got 30 seconds so I'll

00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:04,820
try and make it quick okay when you when

00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:06,619
you build an appliance the idea is that

00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,600
everything is contained and people know

00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:09,980
exactly what it is that it does so maybe

00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,550
you can add a card to it or something

00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:12,230
like that

00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:14,750
but in terms of the software you want

00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:17,690
the software build and the set of cards

00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:19,369
that go in it to be fairly static so

00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:21,350
that it's nice and controlled and you

00:49:19,369 --> 00:49:24,110
know what it's going to do if you're

00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:26,150
building something yourself then you

00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:28,190
know you can go out and buy pcs that

00:49:26,150 --> 00:49:29,510
don't look like pcs where you can kind

00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:35,750
of pretend for your customer that it's

00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:37,970
not a PC when it really is when it says

00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:40,010
the appliance that's on there there has

00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:41,270
a there's a an expectation of what that

00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,070
box is going to do and what it's capable

00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:46,340
of doing and what the testing is and

00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:47,960
everything like that so we are fairly

00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,810
controlled in terms of the software that

00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:53,960
we will put on a system that carries or

00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:56,930
carries the appliance name on it we do

00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:59,210
also have asterisk appliances that are

00:49:56,930 --> 00:50:01,359
not specifically tied to the prepackaged

00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:05,420
stuff that might be able to be useful

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:10,910
right if you'll have any other questions

00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:13,070
you can ask me laughter this so this
