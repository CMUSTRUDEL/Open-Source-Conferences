the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,359
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,740
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,049
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,970
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,590
southeast linux fest org um okay so i

00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,689
didn't bring slides because i've been

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,240
told the powerpoint rot your brain so

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:25,949
can everyone hear me okay i'll be

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,539
flailing around a lot of anyone can hear

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,660
me just yell what or something like that

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:33,000
and we'll go from there I'm a terrible

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,070
public speaker I should probably say

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,649
that right from the start Jerry Seinfeld

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,360
was saying a few years ago that

00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:41,250
statistics show that when you ask people

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,670
with their biggest fears are public

00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,170
speaking ranks above death which means

00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,289
that you'd rather be the guy in the box

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,059
and the one speaking in front of it so

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:53,550
that being said I notice that the other

00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:55,199
two sessions here are the Ubuntu kernel

00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,820
which generally just works and no one

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,920
needs to think about it and networking

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,370
101 which nobody wants to think about so

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,580
you're stuck with me for the hour ok so

00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,659
my name is Ryan Gordon um for a living I

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:11,670
port video games to Linux and Mac OS and

00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:13,500
your toaster and things that video games

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:15,360
were never meant to be on and you know

00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,530
that's what I do for a living I've

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,720
worked for companies you might have

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,759
heard of if you've played a game in last

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,500
Oh 10 years or so you've probably either

00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,030
played something I've poured it if it

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,490
was on Linux or you've played something

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,350
I worked on in some form so I don't want

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,490
to talk too much about myself I'm boring

00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,759
but what I have to talk about is very

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,729
interesting so um okay who in here has

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,400
played a game on Linux before all right

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,170
Wow I'm not like X bill and stuff I'm

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,549
talking about like big commercial stuff

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,740
the things they tell you that Linux

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,000
wasn't meant for all right still a lot

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:52,500
of you and thank you I appreciate your

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,299
business ok so gaming in Linux has

00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,549
changed quite a bit if you if you've

00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,710
heard this talk five years ago 10 years

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,299
ago it changes every week and new

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,969
developments come up and there's new

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,380
successes and defeats and it's an

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,659
ongoing soap opera so I'm going to go

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,700
through this and I have this talk broken

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,000
into three sections I have called what

00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,770
we did what to use and what to do I'll

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,980
let you figure out which parts which

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:18,480
um first a little bit of history this

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,120
really all stirred there have been games

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,660
like X bill and nethack and you know

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,460
many variations on both of those but the

00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,530
first time that people looked at Linux

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,980
is it possibly like a serious gaming

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,720
platform and not just a you know a place

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,610
where you get a telnet session or a

00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,870
place where you run a mainframe server

00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,070
and stuff like that the first time

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,100
people look this said I guess it's down

00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,540
to desktop and play a video game on my

00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:44,790
linux box without rebooting heaven

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,890
forbid into windows 95 was a game called

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,910
doom who's played doom if you haven't

00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,980
played doomed you're too young you have

00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:57,240
to leave I'm sorry there's a company

00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,680
called its software they made a game

00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,160
called doom if you've never played it

00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:05,040
it's uh it was the first 3d kind of like

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:06,720
serious 3d type of game and you saw

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,070
nothing but what your character was

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,530
seeing in the barrel of his gun and you

00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:12,470
shot demons and ran around and it had a

00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:14,910
good sense of humor and stuff like that

00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:16,470
they released its software the company

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:18,240
it did doom did it released a close

00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,920
source binary for Linux at one point

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,320
back when no one had ever thought of

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,730
doing something like this and the readme

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,930
that came with it was very instructive

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:27,240
it was written by a guy named Dave

00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:29,130
Taylor the Linux versions read me was

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,400
and among other information in this

00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:34,320
little tiny file was this game does not

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,820
generate revenue for us on Linux I only

00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,820
did this because it gives me a woody

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:46,830
that's a quote I didn't make that up but

00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,540
it started a small fire which has been

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,520
growing growing and we've been throwing

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,350
gasoline on it where we could from there

00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:55,110
a couple other games showed up and then

00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,490
notably in the late 90s in the early

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:59,700
2000s there's a company called low key

00:03:56,490 --> 00:04:02,580
software low key games who had the crazy

00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:04,890
idea of why don't we go out and become a

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,590
Linux game publisher why don't we go out

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,900
there and buy the rights to games that

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,489
are popular right now package them up as

00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,470
a full Linux version you go out to a

00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:15,480
store heaven forbid you go to like Best

00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,390
Buy or media play or whatever you have

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,549
in the southeast and buy a copy of quake

00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,109
3 on the shelf and put the disk in your

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:23,490
drive and there's a Linux version on

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,070
there and it says oh yeah here's a shell

00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:27,270
script to install it and how exciting no

00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,740
one had ever thought to do this

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,830
and it didn't work too well they went

00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,819
out of business for lots of reasons that

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,949
had nothing to do with whether you could

00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:36,840
actually sell Linux games or not but at

00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:38,069
one point in their history in their

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,840
short history they're only around for

00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,220
say two years two and a half years total

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,169
they did a couple of things that were

00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,169
very noteworthy one you could go into a

00:04:43,169 --> 00:04:48,419
Best Buy or a media play or a fries or

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:50,310
whatever a Walmart for crying out loud

00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:51,659
and say there's a video game section

00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:53,610
because there's always a video game

00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:55,050
section at any big box store and they'll

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,849
be like here's our hottest games these

00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,440
are the games we want to put on the

00:04:56,849 --> 00:04:59,849
shelf where your eyeballs will see them

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,889
where the impulse buy says that looks

00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:04,560
really cool I need to get a copy of that

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:06,630
and if you looked at it any at a given

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,069
time to keep track of top 10 games you

00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,300
know what are the hottest selling games

00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:11,819
on Windows and we're looking we're going

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:14,430
1 2 3 4 5 there's about eight nine

00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:16,800
sometimes seven somewhere high near that

00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,360
number 10 of the top 10 games we're

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,400
running on Linux his native versions you

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,979
could go out and buy or download or what

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,259
not a Linux version of the best-selling

00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:28,080
games at the time it was a massive

00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,490
achievement that involved a massive

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,650
amount of capital that Loki just simply

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:34,409
didn't have but there is a better way

00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,880
we'll get to that Loki did one other

00:05:34,409 --> 00:05:38,550
thing that was really really smart and

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,590
they came in and recognized that the

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:42,030
tools they needed did not exist little

00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,069
things like little things you take for

00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,620
granted for example to say you are you

00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:49,039
buncha user or a red hat user because I

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,870
see your Fedora not to call you out sir

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,919
can I got break down here like um who

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:59,159
runs fedora who's a you Bunty person

00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:01,819
gentoo slackware there's always one I

00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,819
saw you back there

00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,040
he's got the t-shirt and everything um

00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:11,300
thank you I just like to take a poll

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,919
there um I don't remember saying but we

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,169
notice that if you're a for example you

00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:16,760
bunt to user you just use app get and if

00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,980
you're a fedora user you just use yum

00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:23,690
and if you're slackware you just spend a

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:28,760
lot of time I used to be a slacker user

00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:29,840
I can say that they these things you

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,520
take for and you can just install

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,750
software but when you're selling

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,060
software came on disk it's like well

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,400
what do you do to make sure it's going

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,229
to work on RedHat Ubuntu and slackware

00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,639
and stuff so look a low key went out

00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:42,650
there and built their own installer it

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,120
was called low key set up and it lasted

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:46,639
many many years we're just replacing it

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,050
now for cross distribution software

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,560
installation with something called mojo

00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,510
setup they built something called sdl

00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,460
which we'll get to later which is help

00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,900
them get bits onto the screen to help

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,580
them get bits to the video card the

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,620
audio card they built a motion video

00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,300
decoding libraries for MPEG video which

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,390
was hot at the time it's not anymore but

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,039
hey that was ten years ago they built

00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:12,280
all these tools for things that they

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,419
would need that didn't exist and i think

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,039
more important than the games because

00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:17,840
games come and go I mean quake 3 is

00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:19,250
still cool in a certain way but you know

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,900
your friends are not going to get around

00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,220
be like will you plan tonight left for

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:27,260
dead man's gonna be awesome we playing

00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:31,729
quake three came out in 1997 want to

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:37,820
play no but we'll get to quake 3 later

00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:39,620
too but lowkey build all this stuff they

00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:41,870
needed for that and the games were great

00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,250
at the time and like all markets it has

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,530
moved on these games become more

00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:47,870
obsolete beyond you know the

00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,120
archaeologists in the aficionados but

00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,680
the tools that mentality of get in there

00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,660
and build what you need and don't whine

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,550
if it's not there just roll up your

00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,080
sleeves and build it yourself that has

00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:59,270
been incredibly valuable and you see it

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,160
all over the Linux community you see it

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,780
in the distros you see it in the kernel

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,310
you see there's very little time where

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,740
people whine about stuff not being there

00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:10,010
they just sit down and do it and you

00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,050
know become little spots of light in the

00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,270
wilderness the heroes of open source and

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,409
stuff Loki did that same thing all their

00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,800
tools they built they obviously they

00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:17,659
couldn't

00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,190
source the games because they didn't own

00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,080
the intellectual property on them so it

00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:22,940
goes but all their tools the open

00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,379
sourced and low key went under but

00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,599
Lucky's tools lived on and for another

00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,090
decade they served us really well and

00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,710
we're going to get some of those later

00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,909
now today all those things have gone

00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,769
there were a couple other ones I don't

00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,320
mean to minimize other ones besides low

00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:37,969
key look he was just one of those big

00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:41,000
really spectacular failures that people

00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:42,500
talk about later but there are others

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,170
there was Hyperion who did a game called

00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,490
show go and Giants and ported Linux

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,839
versions of it and eventually decided

00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:49,250
the linux market wasn't worth their time

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,480
so they started doing amiga versions of

00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:57,050
their games this is not a joke um eine

00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,550
even know there wasn't a minute there

00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,810
there's a game there's a company called

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,610
Linux game publishing they're still

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,950
around today they don't do many games at

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:06,170
once they're very risk adverse they wait

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:07,640
till they can get a good game cheap that

00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,980
they can sell for a long time this is

00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,300
not a bad strategy we wouldn't have a

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,540
housing crisis as people thought this

00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:16,339
way but but they're not the biggest

00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,209
baddest thing out there you know but

00:09:16,339 --> 00:09:18,320
they are still around they're still

00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:19,550
selling games and if you go to Linux

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,600
game publishing com they would love to

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:25,640
take your money they will ship today so

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,350
so there are still commercial interests

00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:29,029
around in that regard but we found that

00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,620
commercial interest for Linux games

00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:32,560
still exists it just exists in a

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,760
different form it's no longer an

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,410
individual publishing entity it's no

00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,209
longer a low key games there's no longer

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:40,270
a Linux game publishing or whatnot that

00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:42,680
wants to sell you a box Linux version in

00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:44,450
this day and age it costs too much to

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,130
put something in a minute a Linux

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,270
version in a box because really you're

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,790
paying to ship a whole bunch of

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,700
cardboard and oxygen across the country

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,790
and a big gaming box and a little piece

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,649
of plastic as a DVD and it you have two

00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,910
bright literally bribed places like best

00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,130
buy to get on their shells and stuff

00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,810
it's just not worth the money to get in

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,940
there however we have a solution to that

00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,649
it's called the Internet we're very

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,820
quickly whether it's games are otherwise

00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:09,860
getting to the point where you're not

00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,940
going to pay for a physical CD anymore

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,350
when you do it's going to be a novelty

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,589
it's gonna be like happy birthday I had

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:22,750
to get you something physical you know

00:10:14,589 --> 00:10:22,750
games again but but we have a

00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:26,420
but we're getting to the point where

00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,420
you're just going to download games and

00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:31,220
then that massive amount of initial

00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,130
capital you need just to get in the door

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,180
gone don't need it anymore and you're

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,899
starting to see things like that we'll

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,220
talk about that a little later on to

00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,779
finally there's what so you have your

00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:44,149
commercial interests and then you have

00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:46,339
the open-source interest of video games

00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:47,660
and some of you might be playing some of

00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,070
these games and not realize it for

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,600
example i mentioned quake three before

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:52,130
quake three is open source it is

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,680
literally under the gnu general public

00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,910
license you can get quake 3 under the

00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:01,550
GPL now it's software remember the woody

00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:02,959
guys they have that long history of

00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,700
doing this they put out that Lynch

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,990
version of doom didn't make any money

00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,540
but you know they're they're hardcore

00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,490
tech people they look it it would offend

00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:12,829
their techy soul not to play around with

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,560
that kind of thing so they did that and

00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:16,910
then every four or five years after

00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,320
their game ships and they're not making

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:21,680
money off it anymore because your span

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,420
in retail video game sales is about one

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,410
week two weeks depending if it's

00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,300
Christmas depending on what the

00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,940
competition is you'll spend 40 million

00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:31,279
dollars and four years building a game

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:33,020
and then you get two weeks to make your

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,370
money back and then nobody wants to talk

00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,200
about your game anymore which is a

00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,520
really frightening place to be but you

00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,690
know there's always going to be your

00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,070
successes you're still going to have

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,430
your half-life tues and you're still

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,600
going to have your doom your dub quake

00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:46,520
threes and stuff like that where they

00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:47,990
were large commercial successes in that

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,399
two weeks fan and whatever they can make

00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,600
after that but there comes a point of

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,300
diminishing returns where these games

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,610
just don't make money anymore who's

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,310
going to buy a copy of um I don't know

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,740
commander keen at this point does anyone

00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:02,690
remember commander keen it was awesome

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:05,180
in the time if you like Super Mario

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:06,770
Brothers to give you an idea like if you

00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:08,589
could play it on a pit Nintendo that's

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,490
about the arrow or thinking of here

00:12:08,589 --> 00:12:12,199
nobody's gonna pay for that game anymore

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:14,209
because it's ancient and if they do it's

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,889
a novelty thing and there I bought it on

00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:20,369
steam i admit so you can

00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:21,869
I like Commander Keen sue me um so you

00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:22,920
can't tell if it's gonna be a novelty

00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:24,269
thing it's you're not going to make

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,609
millions of dollars off of any of these

00:12:24,269 --> 00:12:29,009
games in fact to Sweeney from Epic Games

00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:30,389
used to run his company when they're

00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:32,519
making text based games like a net hat

00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:35,519
clone for das they were making called

00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,549
ZZT he he still sells about three or

00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,839
four copies a year his dad still lives

00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,899
the same mailing address that his

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,309
company was run out of so you know every

00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,959
couple weeks sends out another copy is

00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:47,639
easy T for whatever it is five bucks

00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,199
because somebody had some novelty sends

00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,819
a tee on a floppy disk just to you know

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,709
punish you for it and and you know you

00:12:53,819 --> 00:12:57,929
could still sell it but I mean twenty

00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,339
dollars a year compared to unreal

00:12:57,929 --> 00:13:00,899
tournament three costs God knows how

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:02,519
many millions to make and the technology

00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,949
they licensed for god knows how many

00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,829
millions of dollars to big triple-a

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:09,959
companies every year who cares about

00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,489
twenty dollars in that regard so with

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,079
that mentality in mind its software said

00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,459
here's the source code and it's just not

00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,499
here's the source code but here's the

00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:18,809
source code under the GPL do whatever

00:13:16,499 --> 00:13:20,639
you want with it go nuts in fact there

00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:22,799
was one point where someone didn't abide

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,899
by the GPL and John Carmack runs the

00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,160
company does it went directly after that

00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:27,540
guy and said I'm going to sue you with

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,269
whoever the Free Software Foundation

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,769
recommends if you do not release your

00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:33,179
source code changes now that guy means

00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,860
business also if you've ever been

00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:40,889
bitch-slapped by John Carmack you feel

00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:42,299
that um so uh so you have these games

00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:43,829
and I don't mean to single out did

00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:45,660
software other people have done this 3d

00:13:43,829 --> 00:13:47,189
realms did it with Duke Nukem 3d if that

00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:51,839
anyone remembers that game a game was

00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:53,249
awesome still is you know other

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,100
companies have done it which are

00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:57,360
slipping my mind at the moment but

00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,279
they've seen one they've seen its

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,449
example on this but they've also seen it

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,369
works we're not gonna make any money

00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:04,470
let's see what people can do with it and

00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:06,239
we found that people do interesting

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,829
things I like to split these into two

00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:09,449
groups I call them the open-source

00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:10,919
Indiana Joneses and I call them the

00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:14,339
open-source Isaac Newton's I'll explain

00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:15,689
why the Indiana Joneses are the ones

00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:16,769
that go into the temple and grab the

00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:18,539
diamonds and run out with the Boulder

00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:19,769
chasing them behind them you know I'm

00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,389
talking about we've all seen this movie

00:14:19,769 --> 00:14:23,959
if you haven't seen you're also too

00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:23,959
young go

00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:33,640
the new one doesn't count um but these

00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,580
are the people that go in there and say

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,440
okay this game ran on 16-bit dots it

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:41,080
wrote right to the video card registers

00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,300
it expected you to have a sound blaster

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,640
16 or it wouldn't start up and you know

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,380
there is no hardware abstraction at all

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,910
in fact today one remembers most dos

00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,160
games they'd be like click a checkbox

00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,630
for the sound card you have and it's

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,130
like these are the five sound cards you

00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:55,540
can use with this game because we've

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:57,850
written directly to the registers of

00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,380
those five nothing else works there's no

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,350
concept of a device driver it was das

00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:04,330
you know what could you do it doesn't

00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,580
change the fact this source code here

00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,960
have another GPL can you still write to

00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,810
the sound blaster registers is that

00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:12,370
still going to work no sorry I mean what

00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,720
you gonna do about so keep these Indiana

00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:15,700
Jones people have run into the temple

00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,350
ripped all that crap out gotten the

00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:19,810
thing to build with GCC gotten it to

00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,700
work with modern hardware modern

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:23,920
operating systems and said here's the

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,870
exact same game you played before but it

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,510
now runs on linux the native 32-bit

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,630
64-bit whatever bit binary this is not

00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,790
running as a das emulated dosbox thing

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:35,800
this is the real thing and oh this used

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,940
to talk over an ITX network rip that out

00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,380
now you can play it over the internet

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,470
you know things like things we never

00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:43,180
dreamed of doing in the early 90s you

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:47,520
know when these the hot thing was

00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,520
windows 31 for lack of a better term

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,800
um yeah so so these Indiana Joneses come

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:56,709
in and they do something kind of heroic

00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,600
they run in and they with the das

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:00,399
Boulder chasing behind them they get

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,009
these games running on Linux and the mac

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,860
and modern windows and you know if you

00:16:03,009 --> 00:16:07,600
see quake two ports on Palm Pilots and

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:10,050
crazy things like that because they can

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,339
it's awesome now the Isaac Newton's

00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,360
Isaac is famous for lots of things but

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,250
everyone's heard that shoulder of giants

00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,240
quote you know if I've come this far

00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,790
it's only because I stood on the

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,440
shoulders of giants okay maybe you

00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:25,690
haven't heard it there's this guy named

00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,920
Isaac Newton um yes so um that applies

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,779
in the sense that there are people that

00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,790
will port these games and there's other

00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,500
people to say that game was cool I liked

00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,180
quake three but I've had this game I've

00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,850
always wanted to build it's got aliens

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,980
in it and it's got bases that you have

00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,110
to storm and blahdy blahdy blahdy and

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,569
they bribed their friends with pizza and

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,880
you know where's or something like that

00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:47,529
and they get a team together a small

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,180
team and they'll take this game that

00:16:47,529 --> 00:16:51,069
someone else is made and make it into a

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,829
new game they've literally stood on the

00:16:51,069 --> 00:16:55,510
shoulders of giants that have made big

00:16:53,829 --> 00:16:57,670
impressive technology and they've taken

00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:59,139
that and said okay the quake engine did

00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:00,819
a lot of interesting things and this

00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:02,260
vision I've had for a game I that I

00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,430
always want to make I can now make and

00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,640
you see things have come out of it like

00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:08,380
tremulous which is a new version it's a

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,059
first person shooter multiplayer game

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:11,409
build on top of quake three but is its

00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,569
own game its own right it's not a simple

00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:16,530
modification it's a full game in of

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:19,929
itself or dark places or neck next us or

00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:20,919
etc like that these are the Isaac

00:17:19,929 --> 00:17:22,870
Newton's and they're out there and

00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:26,260
they're saying I don't want to spend

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,699
five man years building the technology

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,280
behind this I just want to build a game

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:31,390
and they're taking this GPL source code

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,799
that people are doing and building

00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:36,429
something incredible and beautiful and

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,860
unexpected on top of it so that's where

00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,240
we are today i run the site called

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,340
achilles org I don't know if anyone's

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:48,190
seen it if you haven't that's okay I

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:50,500
forgive you we we do two things running

00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:52,450
along what I said was the best thing of

00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,210
loci we still build open source

00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:57,250
technology install our software I mr.

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:59,169
mojo set up briefly before libraries

00:17:57,250 --> 00:18:01,280
that help gamers do gamer type things

00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:03,530
like physics FS which

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,060
makes file system access easier for the

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,550
ways games want to do it and stuff like

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,780
that other people have come to this site

00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,340
it's not all game orient but that's the

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,080
kind of focus we've like to keep on is

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:14,150
that we want to build this community of

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,190
people building open source stuff ports

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,310
of games the Indiana Jones is in the

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,650
Isaac Newton's and and the Edison's and

00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:25,070
such that are building stuff that other

00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:26,900
people can build and we're kind of we

00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:28,190
joke that we call ourselves sourceforge

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,770
assault Chris you're not out there are

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,150
you okay good Chris DiBona is talking

00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,590
later asked him about source for some

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,050
day he was very heavily involved in that

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:38,300
we used to when i started iculous at

00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:39,910
oregon notice that source forgers out

00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:42,230
there who has a project on sourceforge

00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:44,450
who's a project that actually has done

00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:47,180
anything on sourceforge no hands go up I

00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,500
saw it source George had a big problem

00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,510
that there were a million projects on it

00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,750
and all of them had like one header in

00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,980
CVS and nothing else or they had a forum

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:56,690
where they talk about how awesome their

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:58,940
project is going to be but as soon as we

00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,950
find someone that can read a book on C++

00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,940
and you all know the type you've all

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,470
been involved in these projects i've

00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,140
been involved in these projects everyone

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,520
has an intellectual exercise but it

00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,080
occurred to me that that's kind of a

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,670
waste of space and there's nothing more

00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,410
frustrating than googling for that one

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:14,660
thing you need that like i need saying

00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:16,670
that converts word documents to blah

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:18,410
blah blah format and you google forward

00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:19,910
to blah blah blah and there's a link to

00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:26,330
a source first page with no damn source

00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:27,770
code I hate that so with a kilo Sidora I

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,030
wanted to make a space kind of like

00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:30,530
source boards you get your revision

00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:32,780
control and your email and your shell

00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:34,130
account and all that stuff on my

00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:37,730
beautiful rack server somewhere in the

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,530
heart of chicago and basically you get

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,690
no limitations anything we can make work

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:44,120
for you we will do for you if you need a

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:46,460
new for it we step CVS server now a

00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:47,750
subversion get mercurial you know people

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,730
have asked for these things we add them

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,320
bug tracking blah blah blah we want make

00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,150
the developer experience good because

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,830
the primary key of Achilles adored is

00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:59,180
that we are elitist jerks we send so

00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,770
many people away it used to be about

00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,780
half the people that talk to me I would

00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,100
send away they'd be like yo man I got

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,500
this idea it's going to be more awesome

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:10,370
than dhoom3 and it's going to have per

00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:11,750
pixel shader lighting and 50 levels in

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,610
bubble and it's like one it's like a

00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,279
thirteen-year-old kid you know in junior

00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,749
high you know

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,279
type you've all been that 13 year old

00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:23,249
kids some of you are still that 13 year

00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:26,849
old kid read a book on see kid but but

00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:28,440
um yeah so there's nothing wrong being

00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,879
that 13 year old kid I you know I always

00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,409
make that joke and the speech and true

00:20:29,879 --> 00:20:32,969
to me I shouldn't do it because those

00:20:31,409 --> 00:20:34,559
are the next generation last Torvalds

00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:36,029
they all started that way in fact if you

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,690
look at list revolts first email about

00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:41,429
linux it's kind of goofy you know back

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,629
me up on this you know I'm right so you

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:43,679
shouldn't discourage those people I

00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:45,269
don't mean to make fun of you if you're

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,859
one of those 13 year olds too seriously

00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:50,070
right two headers before you email me

00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:52,679
but um so we send a lot of people away

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:54,929
and we found that be and we're honest we

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:57,359
don't we're not brood I hope but we

00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,499
don't we will tell people we don't think

00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,929
that project is going to work or come

00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:02,639
back to us in a while when you've worked

00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:05,279
on it and then will nurture you will be

00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:06,719
your open source incubator but too many

00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,399
of the even with incubation a lot of

00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:10,320
these projects just die right on the

00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,570
vine before they even sprout I don't

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,589
know if that was a mixed metaphor but

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:17,820
the even even carefully reading people

00:21:16,589 --> 00:21:19,919
out saying I don't think that will work

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:21,149
or you need to come back later so I

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,279
think that we still had about a fifty

00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:25,080
percent failure rate so when I'm

00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,369
individually weeding people by hand

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,399
imagine what the failure rate must be on

00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:32,609
sourceforge so not to compare I'm just

00:21:29,399 --> 00:21:33,749
saying so that's where we are today this

00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:35,429
is not what I came to talk to you about

00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:37,619
I just want to give you an overview for

00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:40,070
those that have never played a game has

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,210
anyone here never played a video game

00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:43,710
see no one ever raised their hands for

00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:45,450
this and there's a reason for that most

00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:47,070
of if I was like who out there has all

00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:48,659
58 achievements and left for dead

00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:50,369
unlocked no one raised their hand cuz

00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:52,409
even the hardcore gamers aren't that

00:21:50,369 --> 00:21:54,690
hard core and the lighthouse is a very

00:21:52,409 --> 00:21:56,839
hard level if you haven't played it it's

00:21:54,690 --> 00:22:00,049
I'm never going to get that achievement

00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,049
but um

00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:06,170
but you know there is a mentality of

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,300
hardcore gamers you know the types the

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:10,880
ones that go to the 10,000 person land

00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:12,290
games and you know quake Khan and stuff

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,360
like that and just they don't shower for

00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:15,680
days and you know you know the type

00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:19,280
we've all seen them and we're all scared

00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:27,220
of them if they had any muscle tone oh

00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:27,220
they might mug you you don't know um but

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,470
but those are not people think about

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,640
this the hardcore gamers they go I'm not

00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:36,380
like that I'm different than those

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,820
people I'm not a gamer well you might

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,710
not be a hardcore gamer and frankly good

00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:41,300
for you if you're not but and you might

00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,620
even like first-person shooters and not

00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,550
be a hardcore gamer you might just like

00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,280
to sit down with your friends and play

00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,380
halo on the Xbox every now and then more

00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,480
power to you it's the problem is we've

00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:52,310
gotten to this point where people say

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,780
they're either a game or they're not and

00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,760
not a single one you raised your hand

00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:57,470
because playing solitaire is gaming

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,880
playing x bill is gaming you know

00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,420
sometimes just deleting all the spam in

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,070
your inbox is kind of like a game but

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,540
but without going that far everyone has

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,010
a game they like to play and this is

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,330
only accelerated in recent years because

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,150
their loss philippine that would say oh

00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,520
I don't play video games but I play

00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:15,050
peggle all the time oh okay Hagel's not

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,820
a video game right or more to the point

00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,790
I don't play video games but i love the

00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:22,240
sims anyone play the sims not really a

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:25,310
video game but it's a video game

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,840
everyone is a gamer and it's remarkable

00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:29,000
to me because I bring props everywhere I

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,430
go I find them out in the hallways this

00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,990
is up dan let's see this up on the board

00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:34,880
out there I don't let you can see that

00:23:32,990 --> 00:23:36,650
on the camera I'm sorry it's a it's an

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,360
apple advertisement it says buy a mac

00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,270
for college and get a free ipod touch

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:45,290
it's a great return on your investment

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:47,090
hmm it is i like mac OS i mean i think

00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,140
that when you're willing to spend money

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,240
for something I think you should

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:54,500
probably buy the Lexus and not the you

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:58,850
know you go but but it's remarkable to

00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,290
me that what marketing will do for you

00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:01,820
because how much do you pay for a linux

00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:04,580
distribution does even they won't even

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,290
pay for the discs anymore why can't we

00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,300
market that why is this hanging up out

00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,970
there and we're not hanging out you know

00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:13,750
you're a gamer your you can play games

00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:16,309
for free on linux you know you are

00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:25,899
you need a word processor we have one

00:24:16,309 --> 00:24:25,899
that doesn't suck for free you know I

00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:33,470
you know of all the ridiculous things I

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:40,100
said I didn't think that would be the

00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:41,120
joke okay okay so it's it's baffling to

00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,919
me and I'm going to talk about this a

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,980
little bit further and by what to do

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,299
section but I want to move on from this

00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,279
will talk about the Apple add some more

00:24:47,299 --> 00:24:50,889
but I was telling you this for a reason

00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,809
now I forget oh yes we're all gamers so

00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:55,130
you know it's remarkable to me that we

00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:57,200
everyone in this room can identify

00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:59,210
themselves as someone that likes to play

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,070
video games and not doesn't think

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:03,049
there's some childish thing it doesn't

00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:04,820
have to be an obsession it can be a nice

00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:06,679
pastime but no one thinks of it as an

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,240
embarrassment like oh yeah you know

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:11,260
there's just one time was the alley

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:15,580
behind 7-eleven they had a copy of of

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,580
bejeweled 2 and you know how it goes

00:25:16,109 --> 00:25:23,799
Patrol is a gateway drug by the way if

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,539
you didn't know now you know so I want

00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:27,070
to talk to you before I get off on too

00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:28,330
much of a tangent here I want to talk to

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,909
you about some of the technology that's

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:32,859
out there for gaming on Linux because I

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,299
think there probably are people in every

00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:36,399
audience I've talked to that things that

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,529
Linux is still something for secure

00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:39,700
shell sessions to some remote server

00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:41,100
it's definitely that and I use it for

00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,519
that every day and I love it for that

00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,470
but there's more to it than that and not

00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:49,869
just like well it kind of flaky works on

00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:53,080
the fringes this is today you can go

00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:55,239
home and do this right now 3d

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,619
acceleration you can put to video 2 and

00:25:55,239 --> 00:25:58,149
video video cards in your machine and

00:25:56,619 --> 00:25:59,739
have them work in parallel and the

00:25:58,149 --> 00:26:00,970
drivers are awesome I hate to say that

00:25:59,739 --> 00:26:02,980
about close source driver but their

00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:06,309
driver is awesome anything you can do on

00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,649
windows with OpenGL with 3d acceleration

00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:10,749
you can do on Linux there are no

00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:12,369
limitations if you happen to use the

00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:15,190
nvidia drivers and other people are

00:26:12,369 --> 00:26:16,989
catching up but it is it's no longer

00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:20,139
question of can i do that on linux at

00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:21,789
all audio if you want a 3d audio api you

00:26:20,139 --> 00:26:23,470
can do it if you just want to dump bits

00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:25,389
to the sound card so it makes some beeps

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,919
and bloops you can do it something you

00:26:25,389 --> 00:26:29,139
can do on windows you can also do on

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,669
linux there is no limitation their input

00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:32,139
if you want joysticks you want keyboards

00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:32,980
if you want mouse if you want multiple

00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,629
mice if you want to have all your

00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,759
friends plug in a mouse and play an

00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:38,409
eight-person game you can do it on linux

00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:42,100
you are not limited to windows on that

00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:45,669
regard scripting languages actually beat

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:48,129
windows on that so a web browser if you

00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:49,509
want to be able to on Windows if you're

00:26:48,129 --> 00:26:52,269
like well just needed an HTML widget

00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:54,249
just put internet explorer in there and

00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:56,080
pray for the best that used to be a big

00:26:54,249 --> 00:26:57,609
limitation on Linux you always had gecko

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,259
but it was complicated to embed and

00:26:57,609 --> 00:27:01,090
stuff like that now we have web kit

00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:03,519
which is K HTML for those that are

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,080
purists about it it's now is easy on

00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,759
Linux this is doing windows in fact I

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,649
would argue it's better on the next end

00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:09,820
is on windows and anyone's ever had to

00:27:08,649 --> 00:27:12,149
write a web page that works and Internet

00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:15,009
Explorer knows what I'm talking about

00:27:12,149 --> 00:27:18,039
all sorts of technology used to be what

00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,149
we can get this far but there's always

00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:20,919
these few things we have to work around

00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:23,649
that you could do in Windows you can do

00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:25,269
on on Linux but those things are long

00:27:23,649 --> 00:27:27,249
gone the kernel developers have done a

00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:28,690
good job the distribution people have

00:27:27,249 --> 00:27:30,280
done a good job the low

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,020
level the high level everyone's done a

00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,610
good job you have no limitations now

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,560
things will work differently on Linux

00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:37,000
because there's different mentalities

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,530
about how things should be done what

00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,450
user interfaces should look like blah

00:27:38,530 --> 00:27:42,190
blah blah but there is no technical

00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,410
barrier there's no obstacle that you

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:45,880
can't climb so I want to talk very

00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:47,980
briefly about some things you should be

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,480
using if you're writing games or really

00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,940
for the most part if you're writing any

00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,970
kind of multimedia software may be any

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,950
kind of software at all first off i

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:03,040
mentioned sdl before simple direct media

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:07,150
layer layer HTTP lib sdl ili be sdl

00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,560
simple direct media layer org simple

00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,120
direct media layers your kitchen sink

00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,560
it's the answer it's direct x is

00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,390
everything that people always said about

00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:15,340
windows nanana nana we can top right to

00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:17,320
the video cards and you know the the

00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:19,510
video access is fast and input as fast

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,910
sdl has solved that and installed it in

00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:23,740
an incredibly useful way and that when

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:25,090
loki first wrote this we didn't know

00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:27,010
what people were going to use for video

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,530
there are still people using FB khan to

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:30,760
run two-dimensional games and it worked

00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:32,800
great you know you didn't need next

00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:36,190
server and if you had not enough memory

00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,920
you can still run a 2d a full-fledged

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,400
impressive commercial level 2d game on

00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:43,780
the frame buffer council and in Linux

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,740
but most people couldn't use the frame

00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:49,210
buffer council because they annexed

00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:50,890
server running because despite its flaws

00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,470
the x server does give you a lot of

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:55,600
benefits so so there was an open

00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:58,720
question of what people would use as

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,460
their main environment now stl solved

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,870
that problem by not just wrapping this

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,970
stuff in abstraction where instead of

00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:05,500
saying okay do i want to talk to fpcon

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,870
or do i want to talk to this or do i

00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:09,220
want to talk to x server do i want to

00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:13,630
talk to a a live we'll talk about that

00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,510
some other day but a lip is crazy and

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:17,770
you should check it out if you have it

00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,930
instead of doing that it rested a nice

00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:22,210
abstraction you say sdl set video mode

00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:26,470
there you have a video display right

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:28,630
pixels into it go forth and prosper but

00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,730
it also was smart enough to say okay

00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,940
let's look at the system at runtime you

00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,710
installed this game from a disk or from

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,090
a download or what not like that we

00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,290
don't know ahead of time what your

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:39,880
system is going to look like we don't

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:41,560
know what packages you've installed we

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,070
don't know what hardware works we don't

00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,350
know

00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,610
anything and if we know now next time we

00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,380
run it after you reboot and you've

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,940
ripped out some piece of hardware you've

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:51,100
changed a bio sitting we won't know

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,140
again so stl is very good at runtime

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,150
saying what does this person have of

00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,710
this combination of hardware and api's

00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:58,330
that are available and shared libraries

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:00,220
on the system what should we be doing

00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:01,450
and it makes the best decision for you

00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,790
which I know when people make decisions

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:07,960
for you it's terrifying but it works

00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:10,150
really well and this has proved good for

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,350
the video thing which I mentioned pretty

00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:12,280
much everyone's using an X server at

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:14,140
this point I think that's pretty much

00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:16,720
one out unless you're working on an

00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,160
embedded device and even there sometimes

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,900
is the one laptop for children people

00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:25,570
are proving or were proving I don't know

00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:28,420
what we found now is that Linux has kind

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:29,530
of identity problem in audio api's the

00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,210
beautiful thing about writing to the

00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,790
audio devices that there's so many ways

00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:36,160
to do it and none of them work exactly

00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:38,260
the same way so sdl is made so you just

00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,610
say give me an audio give me access to

00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,800
the sound card and it'll figure out how

00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:43,560
to get there whether it's also or OSS or

00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,670
you want to go through pulseaudio or

00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,960
whatever like that it's worked really

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:49,210
well if you're doing any kind of

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,040
multimedia stuff if you have any kind of

00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,810
multimedia stuff on your system you

00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:55,390
probably have a copy of lib stl already

00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,400
installed obviously it comes in all the

00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,960
distribution repositories you probably

00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,760
already have it you can start writing to

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,230
it today it also has the luxury of being

00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,620
one of the easiest api's you will ever

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:07,480
use getting stuff onto the screen if you

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,460
were to do it just to get like a window

00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:13,420
on the screen if you do it in directdraw

00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,790
direct3d one of the Microsoft api's it's

00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,990
about 100 lines of code just to get that

00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,370
thing on the screen nobody knows what

00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:20,840
does they just cut and paste it from the

00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,100
documentation

00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,370
we've discovered there are bugs in that

00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,680
documentation to so you might run into

00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,990
them sdl one line to get one line of

00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:36,630
code one function call for parameters to

00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:41,880
get a window on the screen 640 480 true

00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:43,440
color go to draw stuff to the screen you

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,180
put some pixels in there or use OpenGL

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,460
whatever you like and then you call one

00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,930
function stl flip OOP goes to the screen

00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,130
you're done that's all there's and

00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:52,890
there's stl quit when you want to be

00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:54,390
done with it it's literally on and it

00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:56,160
runs on every platform so Chancellor if

00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:01,140
you wrote to sdl you probably also run

00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:04,740
on linux mac OS windows win64 be us yes

00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:07,380
be haces amiga yes amiga embedded stuff

00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:10,500
you've never heard of the iphone Palm

00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:13,080
Pilot the nintendo DS the sony PSP the

00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,170
sega dreamcast we have a playstation 3

00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:17,190
port going for google Summer of Code

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,230
chances are you're going to change

00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:21,600
exactly zero lines of that code that you

00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:23,370
wrote to make it work on new platform if

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,560
your code will compile and you wrote to

00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:29,130
sdl chances are your stuffs just going

00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:30,270
to work which is awesome I mentioned

00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,830
WebKit briefly i'm running behind

00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,920
schedule so i'm just going to say wet

00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:36,750
kit is awesome HTML whatever you want to

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,130
call it lots and lots of people put a

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,570
lot of money into beating internet

00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,400
explorer and congratulations they have

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:43,830
if you don't know it you're probably

00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,110
using it everything except for firefox

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:48,930
is probably using WebKit at this point

00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:50,910
whether it's the kds browser galleon i

00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:52,680
forget the name of it what conqueror

00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,540
sorry galleon something else entirely if

00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,880
you're using safari on windows or mac OS

00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,280
if you're using google chrome crecer you

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,450
here seriously go to krista Bonas talk

00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,430
afterwards he's been probably going to

00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:04,140
talk about chromium the open-source

00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:08,220
version of google chrome which uses

00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:10,080
webkit it's easy to embed it's easy to

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,610
target it a new system for example if

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,920
you really really don't like the gtk

00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:15,300
target you can point in a KDE which is

00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,070
kind of a full circle sort of thing if

00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:18,990
you want it on your Nokia phone which

00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,550
it's already there then they could make

00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,560
a user interface for it and more than

00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:24,030
just the you know handle what the scroll

00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,590
bar should look like and stuff it's a

00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:28,680
good piece of software if you need to

00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:31,100
embed HTML in your program you need to

00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,690
use it we'll get to that later too

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,230
opengl anytime you want to get stuff to

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,330
the hardware now

00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:38,160
days you should be using OpenGL GL

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,419
stands for graphics library it's not

00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,429
important the only thing you need to

00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:45,419
know is that this is the fastest way on

00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:48,890
X 11 or Windows or Mac OS or anything to

00:33:45,419 --> 00:33:51,150
get things rendered onto the screen it

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,400
abstracts away all the details of that

00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,320
really cool ati card you have or that

00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,730
really cool nvidia card and if you need

00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,340
frames per second or you need really

00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,540
cool looking stuff you pretty much have

00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,790
to use opengl to get performance

00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:06,890
nowadays it's fully supported on linux

00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:08,879
use it love it be part of it scripting

00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:12,629
no one should be writing a game nowadays

00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,070
and C or C++ I mean you can you can

00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:16,889
write the low level stuff in it if you

00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:18,450
want to you know make sure that like the

00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:19,830
main loop runs quickly or something but

00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,480
as quickly as you can you should be

00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:23,070
getting out of native code and into a

00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,389
scripting language you can pick your

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,220
favorite chances are if there's a good

00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,230
scripting language it started on Linux

00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,280
in fact it's usually just the people

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,220
from Windows lagging along eventually

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,810
will get it but chances are if it runs

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:36,389
and runs well it was written by someone

00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,280
who's a linux user now you can pick your

00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:39,600
favorite for gaming I love Lua that's my

00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,879
favorite scripting language right now

00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,590
but there's other ones out there such as

00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:45,389
you know if you want to embed pearl you

00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:46,919
can do it if you want to embed Ruby you

00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:48,359
can do it if you want to embed Python

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,970
into your game you can do it in fact

00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:53,399
there's a package called PI game has

00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:56,070
anyone ever used by game oh right the PI

00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:57,960
game people are in the house pygame

00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:59,340
basically gives you an entire gaming

00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,810
environment that's just low level stuff

00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,060
like put a sprite on the screen or

00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:05,430
whatnot it's and it's the whole package

00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,859
and you write your entire game in Python

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,540
you don't write any C code I'm too

00:35:07,859 --> 00:35:12,060
afraid of white space to use that but

00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,690
it's available and i highly recommend it

00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,010
for people that like python there's no

00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,240
reason not to be using a scripting

00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,790
language as much as possible it makes

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,100
your life easier revision control

00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:24,630
everyone should be using it there's no

00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,130
excuse to be using CVS anymore if you're

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,600
still using it it's time to switch if

00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,590
you work in a place that won't switch is

00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:33,000
time to quit you all have a place like

00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,500
that you all know that place that's

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,400
using visual sourcesafe or something

00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,080
like that I like mercurial teach their

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,720
own subversions very good and it's more

00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,609
than most people need get is very good I

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,690
thought it was a couple weeks ago I

00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,950
thought it was going to be the winner

00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:47,850
I'm not so sure anymore it might be

00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:49,710
mercurial

00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:51,630
so you know if you have your particular

00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:52,890
site on the holy war you can just go to

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,050
the left or right of the auditorium and

00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:56,160
we'll go from there finally the last

00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:58,560
technology i want to mention very

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,060
briefly adays SQL Lite you shouldn't be

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,890
writing config files anymore you just

00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:03,570
absolutely shouldn't SQLite solves all

00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,130
your problems I don't have Richards in

00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,140
the room anywhere but he's giving a talk

00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:09,000
later is a to go see Richard hips

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,400
session on SQL Lite it will change your

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,290
world it's that good you don't have to

00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,930
worry about config files you don't have

00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,330
to worry about storing data it's

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,490
basically an SQL database that sits in

00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:21,930
one file and its really really well

00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,700
engineered and if you want to embed in

00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:27,390
your program it's one C file you're a

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:29,340
fool not to use it it's very good ok so

00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:34,620
moving on because I'm running behind

00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:35,730
here last section what to do I want to

00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,020
talk a little bit about promotion today

00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,900
which is why I brought the Apple poster

00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,010
which I stole from out in the hallway

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:48,120
the college people want mine they can't

00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:49,200
afford a mac anyway there are some

00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,490
things you could be doing a lot of

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:53,400
people have asked me what can we do to

00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:56,340
make linux a more popular platform what

00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,850
can we do to evangelize and promote

00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:02,370
linux and the answer might be face to

00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,290
face nothing you really it's kind of at

00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:06,630
this moment in time if i can be a

00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:09,000
pessimist we've all lost to windows for

00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:11,460
this round because the chance for linux

00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,050
to become dominant was the disaster

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:15,360
known as windows vista and then

00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:17,430
microsoft repackaged vista as windows 7

00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:20,490
and changed about nothing in it and now

00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:22,110
it was talk about how great it is so the

00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,940
marketing campaigns over before it

00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:26,190
started that was a mistake here's how

00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:27,570
this is going to work we're going to

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:29,190
talk about things you can do but the way

00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:31,140
that Linux is going to become popular in

00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,900
America is by becoming popular in the

00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,460
third world it's going to be Russia it's

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,920
going to be China it's going to be

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,230
Africa it could have been one laptop per

00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,170
child it's going to be something that is

00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:44,850
a small embedded system like the Shiva

00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:46,050
plug thing if anyone's seen that cool

00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:48,330
little Woolworth thing you don't talking

00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,620
about those things are awesome but it's

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,480
going to be something like that where

00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:53,430
Linux is coming into people's lives and

00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,310
they don't know it in America like for

00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:57,420
example how many of you have a TiVo how

00:37:56,310 --> 00:37:59,520
many of you have a relative that has a

00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:01,410
TiVo how many of your relatives know

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,030
that their tivo is running Linux

00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:04,350
zero of them except for this guy with

00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:11,670
the big beard and I would expect no less

00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:13,380
from you sir in those ways linux will

00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,970
come into American homes without people

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,470
knowing it but that's an act of

00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,940
subterfuge I think that's good but I

00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:19,650
don't think that's sufficient and I

00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:21,240
don't think that talking to somebody on

00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:23,070
the street is going to change anything

00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,330
because contrary to what people say you

00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:25,890
can't change the world one person at a

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:28,980
time you got changed them groups at

00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:30,780
times countries at times even and more

00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,010
so than you knocking on a door because

00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:35,900
they're gonna think you're a Jehovah's

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:38,640
Witness and not open it you have to go

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:41,580
to China and have China say as a

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:43,140
government edict everyone's using Linux

00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:45,300
the government is not paying for windows

00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,950
anymore and given the right government

00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:49,320
like Hugo Chavez Mike just hate

00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:51,420
microsoft enough it'll go through and no

00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:53,880
no sugar deal and no sweetheart deal

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,050
will change that and then once that goes

00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,280
you have an entire country I'm sure

00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:58,200
there are already countries on I can't

00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,120
think of one on top of my head but once

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,220
you start to have entire nations that

00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,600
are running Linux at the government

00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:06,360
level and then at the school level

00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:08,760
because who had a Mac when they were in

00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:10,290
elementary school now who had a Mac

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,580
after elementary school no one because

00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:14,670
they screwed up the marketing and

00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:16,020
windows one but that's how you get a

00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,490
generation of people that's how you get

00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,230
a nation and once you have a nation of

00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:21,660
people out there with fast internet

00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:23,850
access an entire lifetime of building a

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:26,040
Linux building Linux software and

00:39:23,850 --> 00:39:28,260
building Linux environments and working

00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,660
in linux those people are not going to

00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:32,790
tolerate windows they're not going to

00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,540
tolerate Mac OS well I'll tolerate more

00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:38,990
than windows I guess but they um these

00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:41,340
people eventually in their countries

00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:44,670
will have something that we want and

00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:48,450
that's money within the next year will

00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:50,700
probably want it a lot but um but as

00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,280
these people grow up and want to do

00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,170
business with America they're going to

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,280
say where's the Linux version we're not

00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:58,980
doing business with you a voyeur Ian

00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,840
give me as an exe file you know for

00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:04,600
whatever version of Windows Windows 12

00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:06,800
which is better than vista right

00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,050
that is where it's going to happen I

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,250
don't want to be a downer and say that

00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:12,260
they actually it's actually a positive

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:16,240
message you just have to wait another 20

00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:19,340
years so set your set set your calendars

00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,810
but in the meantime that that's how the

00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,450
business works cuz sooner or later I

00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,400
mean jokes about getting the free ipod

00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:28,540
the five-hundred-dollar ipod with the

00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,540
ten-thousand-dollar mac

00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:35,809
soon soon sooner or later people do

00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:37,930
realize that despite the marketing free

00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:40,069
is pretty damn good and you know I mean

00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:43,189
when you have a whole generation or a

00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:45,049
whole nation or a whole organization

00:40:43,189 --> 00:40:47,599
than saying i'm not paying hundreds of

00:40:45,049 --> 00:40:49,489
dollars per computer because everybody's

00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,930
got five computers on their desk hey

00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:54,109
some of us probably have five computers

00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,489
in our pockets right now I mean you got

00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:57,680
your cell phone you have a netbook on

00:40:55,489 --> 00:40:59,719
your lap I mean there's that computer

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,630
that cameras probably running Linux you

00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:04,699
know whatever something like that so

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:06,259
these things will happen don't panic in

00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:08,420
the meantime here's what you'll be doing

00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:10,069
first off mentor people there's not

00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,499
enough smart American programmers we

00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:15,589
need more of them so if you happen to be

00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:17,839
a smart American programmer go out and

00:41:15,589 --> 00:41:19,459
teach someone to be one go out to a

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,589
community college and offer to teach see

00:41:19,459 --> 00:41:23,059
or whatever that the program language of

00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:26,719
the day is please don't teach see to

00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:28,219
beginners it's terrifying I think it was

00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,469
like Latin everyone should know it

00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,999
really well but you know you throw

00:41:30,469 --> 00:41:34,630
someone into the sea pool on their first

00:41:31,999 --> 00:41:36,529
day and they drown so don't do that

00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,059
start them with logo something

00:41:36,529 --> 00:41:40,969
embarrassing visual basic heaven forbid

00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:42,949
but when you don't laugh visual basic is

00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:47,479
very good if you have never programmed

00:41:42,949 --> 00:41:48,890
before it's low it's it the barrier to

00:41:47,479 --> 00:41:50,479
entry is incredibly low on it because

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:52,549
you can throw up a message box with a

00:41:50,479 --> 00:41:53,689
little ok button and the first time you

00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:55,579
get someone to realize that for the

00:41:53,689 --> 00:41:57,799
first time in their life their computer

00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:01,420
did what they told it to instead of

00:41:57,799 --> 00:42:01,420
whatever it wanted it is

00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:06,009
it's a freeing experience it really is

00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,509
and I think a lot of you that are

00:42:06,009 --> 00:42:09,249
programmers in here which I suspect is

00:42:07,509 --> 00:42:10,749
probably a lot of you I don't want

00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:12,069
stereotype or anything but the first

00:42:10,749 --> 00:42:13,779
time you did program something it

00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:15,160
probably wasn't in C and it probably

00:42:13,779 --> 00:42:16,359
wasn't heaven forbid assembly language

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,869
it was probably something you wouldn't

00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:21,039
admit to you now is probably GW basic or

00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:24,339
something quick basic or something like

00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,069
that or whatnot but or logo which I love

00:42:24,339 --> 00:42:29,769
and no one else in the planet does but

00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:31,059
it was non-threatening and it said my

00:42:29,769 --> 00:42:33,099
god this is the first time ever that

00:42:31,059 --> 00:42:35,170
this has been about discovery and

00:42:33,099 --> 00:42:37,420
creation and it's a beautiful thing and

00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:39,579
it's exhilarating it's a drug it really

00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:42,519
is and the more people you can introduce

00:42:39,579 --> 00:42:43,749
that face-to-face one-on-one that's the

00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,859
most important thing you can ever do

00:42:43,749 --> 00:42:47,170
even if they grow up to be windows

00:42:44,859 --> 00:42:49,869
computer programmers hey man you tried

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,489
your best but you know a windows

00:42:49,869 --> 00:42:53,650
programmer is better than no programmer

00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:56,049
at all in my mind at least so I think

00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,539
the more people you can mentor the more

00:42:56,049 --> 00:42:59,799
people you can teach the better off the

00:42:58,539 --> 00:43:01,209
world's going to be and it's something

00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:02,499
you can do today and it doesn't have to

00:43:01,209 --> 00:43:03,969
be I'm going to quit my job and go work

00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:05,589
at the community college there are all

00:43:03,969 --> 00:43:07,509
these places that want you to give an

00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:09,189
hour of your time go to the library and

00:43:07,509 --> 00:43:12,429
say I want to set up a class we're going

00:43:09,189 --> 00:43:14,079
to talk for an hour every week and you'd

00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:16,539
be surprised what you can do you're not

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,949
going to teach people even probably to

00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:19,809
the level of like here's what recursion

00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:22,439
is it's not important don't get that far

00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:25,989
get far enough where you can do print

00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:27,849
hello world go to ten and even that is a

00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:29,679
magical thing the first time you see

00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:32,410
that happen because the next thing you

00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:34,299
do is go is if I add another line in

00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:36,160
there what if I haven't print two things

00:43:34,299 --> 00:43:39,279
and then go to ten or if I could go to

00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,650
20 what can 20 be you know this is

00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:43,959
magical this is what that's the joy of

00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,849
programming and throughout our lives

00:43:43,959 --> 00:43:48,130
this is beaten out of us as we debug

00:43:45,849 --> 00:43:50,079
another linked list that's the same

00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:52,059
thing we've written for 15 years but at

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,059
that moment in time anything is possible

00:43:52,059 --> 00:43:56,469
so if you can put that gift into

00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:58,359
someone's life you should do it you

00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:00,160
should walk out of the speech and go do

00:43:58,359 --> 00:44:02,140
it if you can do it right now I won't be

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,170
offended no actually I will please don't

00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:08,170
leave until I'm done speaking donate

00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:11,289
code and if you work for some places as

00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:13,479
closed source stuff most of us do you

00:44:11,289 --> 00:44:15,710
should be the guy that always tries to

00:44:13,479 --> 00:44:16,880
broach that conversation about you know

00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,260
I understand we can't open source this

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,790
whole thing because of intellectual

00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,650
property and blah blah blah were

00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:24,349
embarrassed and you know how it works

00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:26,089
but this one function that's one library

00:44:24,349 --> 00:44:28,700
here this one little sub module be

00:44:26,089 --> 00:44:30,290
really useful to everybody and you know

00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,180
if we could just get it out there

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:33,890
there'd be so much goodwill and you

00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,530
could get some PR off of that and talk

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:38,619
in terms of people at wear ties would

00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:41,390
instead of you know dressing like this

00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:43,160
to talk in business terms of things of

00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:46,280
goodwill and marketing and advertising

00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,320
and you know free labor which anyone's

00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,290
works on open source program jack knows

00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:52,880
it doesn't actually work that way but

00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:55,430
but it is important to hear that as a

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,470
suit as a business person and if you can

00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:59,210
get little pieces of code open you'd be

00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:01,010
surprised the kind of things that you

00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,080
use every day as a standard part of a

00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:04,520
standard Linux distribution that we're

00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:06,650
just good will that somebody managed to

00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:08,300
talk their boss in delaying them stick

00:45:06,650 --> 00:45:11,770
out on the internet in fact you could

00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:15,500
argue that's how UNIX started right

00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:18,470
maybe how long um hey AT&T could own it

00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:20,330
all right now you don't know so donate

00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,980
code where you can and if you do stuff

00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,560
in your free time think about releasing

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:28,099
it just stick it on a website put it out

00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,480
on a just a unmarked directory on apache

00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,890
server and be like here's something cool

00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:33,109
i did and then move on with your life

00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:34,910
and someone might find it and it might

00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:36,380
not be that it's going to grow up to be

00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:38,150
the next linux kernel or it's going to

00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:39,410
grow up to be the next web kit or what

00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,730
not like that but someone out there is

00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,050
going to look for a word the blah blah

00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:44,330
blah converter and be thrilled than

00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:46,880
sitting in an anonymous FTP directory

00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:49,490
somewhere so this is a little thing that

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,720
becomes this is a snowflake that becomes

00:45:49,490 --> 00:45:53,060
a boulder rolling down a hill if

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:54,470
everyone does it so start thinking about

00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:55,940
things that when you're building them

00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:57,710
yourself even it's just it you have to

00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,320
scratch even if it's a little script you

00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:01,790
wrote once to rename all the files in

00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:03,530
the directory to be lowercase or

00:46:01,790 --> 00:46:05,089
something like that you know something

00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:06,560
silly like that where it took you ten

00:46:05,089 --> 00:46:09,020
minutes so that you didn't spend an hour

00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,460
doing it put it out there and just make

00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,500
a note on a blog or something like that

00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:13,700
and go on with your life one of the most

00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:17,140
interesting things i had seen recently

00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,430
is who reads the website reddit re DDI t

00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,250
it's a good site it'll waste your whole

00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:23,660
day i love it someone out there one

00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:25,400
point said you know what are people

00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,690
working on that's interesting you know

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,490
just just not--that's were saying

00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,509
whatever you got just make a note just a

00:46:28,490 --> 00:46:32,989
comment on this this

00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:34,249
blog post and there were a lot of

00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:36,559
interesting things it's like this isn't

00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:38,269
nearly done but I think it's cool and it

00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:40,209
did bring me to something called ack has

00:46:38,269 --> 00:46:42,349
they want to use this grep replacement

00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:44,239
all right five minutes left okay we're

00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:45,619
moving on you know you find these things

00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:46,849
by accident some days and getting you

00:46:45,619 --> 00:46:50,359
didn't know you need it until you have

00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:51,559
it like tabbed browsing you know target

00:46:50,359 --> 00:46:54,169
foreign markets I already said this

00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:57,289
before localizations really important

00:46:54,169 --> 00:46:59,329
you cannot speak english in china i mean

00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:01,189
you could but most people don't if

00:46:59,329 --> 00:47:02,509
you're even in talking to an

00:47:01,189 --> 00:47:04,539
english-speaking canada if you go too

00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:06,499
far to one side you're speaking French

00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:11,329
Thank You Quebec for making that

00:47:06,499 --> 00:47:12,799
difficult for everyone but but it is in

00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:14,869
your best interest as an open source

00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:17,209
developer to target non-english

00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:18,979
languages in fact I even get hate mail

00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:20,389
from people in Great Britain because you

00:47:18,979 --> 00:47:22,269
know I spell things with a Z where they

00:47:20,389 --> 00:47:24,139
should have an ass or vice versa so

00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:26,149
there's a site called launchpad.net

00:47:24,139 --> 00:47:29,179
who's the IAM on to person let's hear

00:47:26,149 --> 00:47:31,039
for launch pad launch pad has a service

00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:33,399
call a service translations

00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:35,539
launchpad.net i think i got that right

00:47:33,399 --> 00:47:36,829
you put your open source project on

00:47:35,539 --> 00:47:38,239
there you say these are all the things i

00:47:36,829 --> 00:47:39,559
need translated i tried this as an

00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:42,199
experiment with mojo set up the

00:47:39,559 --> 00:47:43,849
installer 24 hours later i had 18

00:47:42,199 --> 00:47:45,679
different translations two languages i

00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:48,669
have never heard of I swear there's a

00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:48,669
Klingon version in there

00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:52,430
but even things worse like even if

00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,869
you're going to budget localization it's

00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:54,980
a miserable job no one wants to

00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:56,390
translate even if they have the ability

00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:57,830
to and you have that friend who speaks

00:47:56,390 --> 00:47:59,690
French and he's annoyed at you after the

00:47:57,830 --> 00:48:00,859
third string you ask him to translate

00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,160
and you didn't know that there's two

00:48:00,859 --> 00:48:06,290
kinds of Portuguese for example it's

00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,760
important so but these markets are going

00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:09,140
to be important before America's so even

00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,690
though you speak English English is the

00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,190
lingua franca of source code you have to

00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:14,900
be thinking about other languages use

00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:18,140
utf-8 whenever you need to encode a

00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:19,520
string or use W charity whatever think

00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,080
about Unicode if you're thinking about a

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,460
ski and you're thinking about us English

00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,160
you will never think about anything but

00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:27,590
America and at the minimum you're gonna

00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,700
lose money at the minimum you're not

00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:29,840
going to have a bigger than uh figo

00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:30,710
because people in other countries are

00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,180
going to be able to use your stuff

00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:35,240
instead of worshipping you as the next

00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:36,890
Linda's torvalds it's important think

00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:38,420
about foreign markets that's the best

00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,220
way in the next 20 years is your writing

00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:42,590
software to make linux happen on the

00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:46,210
desktop whether you're a game writer or

00:48:42,590 --> 00:48:48,800
otherwise but games also doubly so

00:48:46,210 --> 00:48:50,119
target the lower end the next computer

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,830
you have is not going to look like that

00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,340
netbook despite how tiny it is it's

00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:56,720
going to look like this or you know

00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,730
whoever cell phone who's bought a video

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:01,340
game or a program at all for your cell

00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:03,050
phone raise your hand it does not be an

00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:04,010
iphone it can be anything it doesn't

00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:06,260
have to be back OS it could be an

00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,880
android phone which runs linux sooner or

00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:09,109
later that's where all your software is

00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,520
going to come from whether you buy it or

00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:12,950
download it we're not going to use

00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,240
desktops we don't use desktops now Apple

00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:15,770
is reported i'm sure dell will tell you

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:17,270
the same thing that more than fifty

00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:20,420
percent of their computers are no longer

00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:21,560
desktops their macbooks and i bet you if

00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,960
you wait five years they're not going to

00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:25,730
say macbook they're going to say iphone

00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,680
so think about that do not target the

00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:30,020
high-end think about the low end the low

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,250
end is where the smaller the computer

00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,740
you can run on and write something

00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:35,600
really nice that's where your markets

00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:37,130
going to be that's where your target

00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,869
audience is going to be that's what you

00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:41,119
want to aim for don't use memory you

00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:43,190
don't have to you have to be you can't

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,780
be lazy this is the important thing aim

00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:46,250
for the small see you can run on because

00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,330
the next day when you have to run on

00:49:46,250 --> 00:49:49,780
that Shiva plug and it doesn't have

00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:51,859
enough memory you'll be ready for it I

00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:53,330
have a note here saying don't get stuck

00:49:51,859 --> 00:49:54,560
on important stuff but I decided that's

00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:55,550
unimportant stuff so I'm going to skip

00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,860
that

00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:59,270
and finally and since this is meant to

00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:01,820
be a gaming talk and my last note on

00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:04,700
here and I have two minutes is innovate

00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:05,990
don't duplicate innovate if you look at

00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:07,790
the games that we've talked about all

00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:10,730
these times it's never to the derivative

00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:12,200
it's never the next aliens are coming at

00:50:10,730 --> 00:50:13,640
me and I see the barrel of my gun issues

00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,380
may of those I can't as I look for the

00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,990
red key to get to the exit that game has

00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,850
been done for 20 years now it's time to

00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:21,110
stop making that game if you look at the

00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:23,840
games that people are going to talk

00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:25,970
about it's going to be the braids it's

00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:28,580
going to be the past it's going to be

00:50:25,970 --> 00:50:30,050
paths if you haven't played that's a

00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:33,440
weird game you should try it once and

00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:34,610
only once we're going to start talk

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,970
about things like games as art but I

00:50:34,610 --> 00:50:39,410
mentioned braid specifically because you

00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,840
look at this type of game and it does

00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:44,630
something no one's done before it's done

00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,670
it in 125 megabyte download when

00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:50,360
everyone else is downloading 8 gigabyte

00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,890
games you know and it's realized that

00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:53,690
pretty graphics although it's not an

00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:55,730
ugly game by any means pretty graphics

00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:57,800
are not important gameplay was important

00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:01,010
pac-man was a great game it looks like

00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:02,600
crap but damned if I didn't go into a

00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:06,590
pizza shop your name put a quarter in ms

00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:07,940
pacman because it's it's phenomenal so

00:51:06,590 --> 00:51:09,920
as you're writing games as you're

00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,150
writing software if you're writing

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,650
software and you're not writing games

00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:14,510
stop writing stuff that looks like

00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:16,190
windows right stuff that works better

00:51:14,510 --> 00:51:17,630
that's why Apple is teh eating your

00:51:16,190 --> 00:51:19,670
lunch right now instead of Microsoft

00:51:17,630 --> 00:51:21,080
bright stuff that does something no

00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:23,180
one's done before but does it better

00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:24,860
that's what you want to do so don't

00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,480
spend any more time thinking about what

00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:27,680
other people are doing think about what

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,330
you want to do think about what you want

00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,430
your computer to get done think about

00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:33,140
what you would like your friends and

00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:36,200
family and colleagues to be running and

00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:40,490
this isn't about a holy war about linux

00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:41,660
or bsd or windows or you know whatever

00:51:40,490 --> 00:51:43,940
the next thing is that we're talking

00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:46,460
about this is about you this is about

00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,260
you and what you want your systems to

00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,360
look like and your experience to be so

00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,890
if i give you one piece of advice its

00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,810
innovate and don't worry about what the

00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:55,190
competition is doing anyway i'm out the

00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:58,390

00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,390
questions i got 30 seconds

00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:09,250
thank you and heroes there's an overflow

00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,250
room

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:19,710
so I have time for questions were with

00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:30,300
them okay I got like a minute if anyone

00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:35,160
has any questions yes yeah yes I do next

00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:37,050
question um it's it's badly name steam

00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:39,060
client at esso you need parts of the

00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:40,050
client but you don't get the client it's

00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:41,670
just the way that Stephen got

00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:43,890
architectured I asked about it to

00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,940
everyone did it's not a big deal but hey

00:52:43,890 --> 00:52:47,790
you never know what the future could

00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:53,030
bring next question go ahead and that's

00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:56,700
good we'll talk afterwards okay go on I

00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:58,140
have a playstation 2 in a we I can't

00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:00,329
bring myself to give microsoft money so

00:52:58,140 --> 00:53:01,859
i never got an xbox and I can't afford

00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:03,510
to play station when the Last Guardian

00:53:01,859 --> 00:53:08,030
comes out I'll probably beg someone for

00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:11,480
a playstation 3 cuz it looks awesome yes

00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:11,480
can I borrow it

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,990
yes sir I don't think game distributions

00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:23,940
are important i think if you think about

00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,870
the distribution is the wrong level you

00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,280
should be able to use whatever you want

00:53:24,870 --> 00:53:28,350
there shouldn't be like we can't install

00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,240
this because debian who cares if it's

00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:33,590
debian we can target slackware and that

00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,590
doesn't look like anything so I mean

00:53:34,970 --> 00:53:39,060
it's a waste of time I mean no one would

00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,950
buy windows or mac OS if it booted a

00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,030
game I mean you want to run on the

00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:43,380
systems that are there unless you're

00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,330
gonna ship a whole console which would

00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:46,500
be awesome but I don't think they a

00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:48,450
gaming distribution I think it's a waste

00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:56,610
of time anyone else I think I'm out of

00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:58,590
time here yes uh let's go with probably

00:53:56,610 --> 00:54:01,020
could I don't know it's good luck to you

00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:02,400
with it but I don't think I there's a

00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,680
lot involved it involves a lot of money

00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,610
and it i think consoles the wrong way to

00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,380
go i think that you have to talk about

00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:08,940
what people are using now unless you

00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,480
have millions and millions of dollars in

00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:14,640
your name's microsoft any questions

00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:15,840
anything else okay I'll be around if

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:22,470
anyone has any questions after this so

00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:24,870
