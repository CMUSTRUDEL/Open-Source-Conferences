all right how many of you here know what

00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:11,490
KDE is and use kte oh good this is going

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,799
to make my job a lot easier since many

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,179
of you probably are not developers and

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,160
couldn't care less about the

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,199
underpinnings other than what it means

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,990
to you as a user i'm going to give you

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:25,830
guys a guided tour of the desktop

00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,830
environment KDE 4 22 this is the latest

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:33,540
public release of our offering to the

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:37,440
community 43 is in beta now and will be

00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,210
released shortly so we have a lot of

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,260
exciting things but I didn't want to

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,360
tease people with stuff that

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:48,030
distributions may not have for a couple

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:51,180
months so with no further delay I want

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:53,309
to welcome you to the KDE desktop when

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,270
you start up for two this is what you're

00:00:53,309 --> 00:01:00,930
greeted with in the stock que te we have

00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,789
a standard application launcher we have

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,640
a quick launch with all of your standard

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,490
applications of web browser personal

00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,150
information manager system settings file

00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,790
manager instant messaging and of course

00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,159
everybody's favorite the audio player um

00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:19,560
this quick launch gives you access to

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,570
everything you need right off the bat we

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,390
also have a search bar where you can

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,560
type in what kind of applications or a

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:31,079
google search right at the right at this

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,060
command line you don't have to open up a

00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,979
web browser you don't have to open a

00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,860
fine dialogue and go hunting for what

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,680
you're looking for if you want to launch

00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:42,600
specific applications you click on the

00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,250
applications button and will you be

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,680
presented with a menu that you can

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,270
traverse through and scan all the

00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,619
applications that are installed on the

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,159
system computer button allows you to see

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,549
drives that are mounted on the system

00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:03,540
hot pluggable devices and commonly use

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,090
folders recently used it's just what the

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,129
name implies it's a set of files that

00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,670
you've recently opened that Katie knows

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,220
about and once you're finished with the

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:16,970
desktop experience

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:19,580
you can leave the session and logout we

00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,860
also have on the bottom of here we have

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,500
a task bar this allows all of your

00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:26,870
Windows applications that are running to

00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,360
be listed and displayed we also have a

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:33,350
system tray which displays both gnome

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:37,670
and KDE application icons that obey the

00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:40,070
ex DG specification we also have the

00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,770
ability to add applets where you can

00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:45,440
like this one specifically will show

00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:47,300
mounted devices we also have the network

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,270
manager which I'll talk about later and

00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:52,220
of course a clock we also have other

00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:55,100
applets that do things like switching

00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,370
desktops you can also as a new feature

00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,010
in KDE add specific you can add

00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:07,430
applications called plasmoids straight

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:08,900
to the desktop to do this you would

00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,510
right click on the desktop and you're

00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,700
introduced with quite a few options the

00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:17,620
first option you'll see up in the corner

00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,570
there is a little black applet that's a

00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,459
fuzzy clock it's called what you would

00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:25,430
basically do is you would select your

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:28,220
icon that you want to launch and you

00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:30,200
would drag it to the desktop or to your

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,350
system bar down here and will

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,580
dynamically add that applet to your

00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:40,160
desktop or the or the taskbar down here

00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:42,769
we also have the ability to grab new

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,540
widgets from the network using something

00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:49,010
in katy called get hot new stuff this

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:53,140
basically allows you to go on the web

00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,730
sites Katie you or katie apps org scan

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,640
different applications are available for

00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,100
download and install them we have the

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,650
ability to search you can search you can

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:07,040
organize them by highest rating you can

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:11,060
get meta information this is horrible

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,340
read I apologize this basically will say

00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,709
how many downloads there were what its

00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,190
ranking was a description of the

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:22,849
application as well as the title and it

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:25,400
shows an icon preview you click install

00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:26,240
it appears up in this menu from this

00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,130
menu you can

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,860
drag it to your desktop or the title bar

00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,960
again one of the other options you have

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,840
to is to change the background in the

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,490
splash screen this can be done if you

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,069
right click on the desktop and you get

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:43,060
the top dialog up there where you can

00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:45,380
set the image that's displayed

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,389
properties about it and if you don't

00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,690
like the stock images again you can use

00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:54,259
get hot new stuff to Katie look for KDE

00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:56,270
look wallpapers search by highest rated

00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:58,400
and select which ones you want to

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,740
install if you want to uninstall it

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,690
you'll see that this one the install

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:06,319
button changes to uninstall once you've

00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:09,199
added it one of the other things that

00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,169
we've introduced with KDE 4 was we

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,659
change the notion of the desktop itself

00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:16,460
we remove the icons because ninety

00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:21,110
percent of the time they're obscured by

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:25,130
windows fortunately we've also kept the

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:28,099
ability to add icons back to the desktop

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:32,780
that are in the desktop folder this is a

00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:36,229
feature that we do not enable by default

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,320
but if you go up to the top dialogue and

00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:42,440
they have desktop activity you change

00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:44,599
that from desktop to folder view and

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,570
you'll get the classic desktop remaining

00:05:44,599 --> 00:05:51,500
we also have the ability to change your

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:54,169
que te menu from the new style launcher

00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:56,300
to an ult to the old classic style menu

00:05:54,169 --> 00:06:02,000
where you can traverse it similar to the

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:04,190
way that Windows works now that you

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,380
actually have configured the desktop to

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:12,560
what you want we're going to talk about

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:15,830
the next thing devices kde4 introduced a

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,919
great new system called solid solid is

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:21,020
the ability to ink it's a layer that

00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,009
sits on top of the internal hardware

00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:28,460
like how you'd have a different audio

00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,960
servers network manager etc it sits on

00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,969
top of that and provides an

00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,820
object-oriented interface so that

00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:37,729
developers can add these hardware

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,540
support to all their applications one of

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:41,940
these such applications is the

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:45,270
media launcher which when I plug in and

00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:47,940
USB stick this dialog pops up this

00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:51,570
dialog gives you the ability to launch

00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,810
like launch the file manager by clicking

00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:58,590
on the icon or two by clicking on this

00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:02,250
spot on this icon to safely unmount and

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:04,050
remove the media once you've clicked on

00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,720
it you're presented with our new file

00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:09,360
manager dolphin dolphin was introduced

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,820
late in a 35 series and became main a

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,770
main application in the forest series

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:16,200
over that time it's matured

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,850
significantly in gained quite a few

00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,880
features with respects to file

00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:25,470
management it's different than the years

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,050
of using kfm or conqueror as a single

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,570
pane file manager this one has the

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:35,070
ability to introduce tabs split views

00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:38,850
you can also traverse you can come you

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:41,040
can copy from one pane to the other it

00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:44,310
gives you a few more features that were

00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:47,000
not available in the old conqueror file

00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:50,900
manager we also have the ability to

00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,990
display mounted network volumes and

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:59,610
common commonly use places one other

00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:01,920
advantage of kit of the dolphin file

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:04,380
viewer is we've added something called

00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,990
meta information some of you have may

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,350
have heard this buzz about semantic

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:13,170
desktop Semantic Web what this really

00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:17,190
entails is the ability to select rate

00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:19,080
and take specific files I don't know if

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,140
you can make this out but there's a star

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:25,320
based rating you can add tags to it and

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:29,070
you can give custom descriptions to

00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,650
every file on the file system with 43

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:35,940
we're introducing the ability to search

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:40,169
and query this meta information so if

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:43,320
you give a file a tag such as music you

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,570
can actually search in the at a later

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,210
date for any files that have the tag

00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:49,650
music that way if you know what you're

00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,600
looking for you don't have to hunt

00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:55,149
through folders or find on file names

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:57,100
you may not know the file name of what

00:08:55,149 --> 00:09:00,430
you're looking for you just know the

00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,550
semantic information around it so that

00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:06,250
that's a very new feature that we

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:08,620
introduced on some of the other little

00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:12,819
nice things is they have icon previews

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:16,089
you can group folders by file types we

00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:18,190
also have a neat little filter bar that

00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:21,089
will pop up at the bottom where you can

00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:24,610
start typing in like asterisk PDF

00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:26,380
filters out everything but the PDFs you

00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:29,290
can start typing in a file name and it

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:31,630
will filter your file view down so it

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,170
just it helps with file browsing it just

00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:40,149
helps make the experience a lot more

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:43,569
streamlined because of this solid

00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:46,750
technology KDE is also able to add

00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:48,759
network manager support network manager

00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,740
ships on most distributions right now

00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,440
and if you're not using that word

00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,500
manager solid provides the ability to

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,870
introduce your own network configuration

00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:02,050
system I've heard a couple people talk

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:04,180
about wicked earlier today and it would

00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,360
be neat if we had that support within

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:11,649
solid so that every distribution would

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,430
have the ability to use our use our

00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:14,430
network management

00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:26,090
that's awesome that's cool alright cool

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:45,190
what one of the advantages of this

00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,350
architecture is that like like he's

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,950
saying one of the arch developers was

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:53,890
able to develop a plug-in that goes into

00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:56,850
the KDE system and are automatically

00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:59,560
their users will get this feature set as

00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:02,470
application developers we don't have to

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:05,140
write special code for network manager

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:07,750
or special code for wicked all we have

00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:10,930
to say is I want to wit a wireless LAN

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,820
interface and I want to know what its

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:16,830
signal strength is I want to know what

00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:21,040
the IP address is I want to know what my

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:23,230
what my essid is I want to know if it's

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,110
enabled again you have your wired

00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,210
interfaces at VPN all of these things

00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:32,320
are encapsulated so that you can

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:34,060
actually as application developers i can

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,920
write an application that can query the

00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,520
network interface and i don't have to

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,070
care what the back end is so it's I

00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,200
think this offers the user is a better

00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,450
experience and developers more

00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:51,220
flexibility with how they're writing

00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:54,310
their code we also introduced a new

00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:56,680
system settings we used to have this

00:11:54,310 --> 00:12:00,880
control panel that we had for years and

00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,380
years and we revamped it trying to make

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,500
it a little more streamlined and

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,960
user-friendly as you can see we have

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,760
these applet we have a couple

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,920
applications we can configure everything

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,940
from your appearance to your desktop all

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,290
the way to adding and removing packages

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,920
changing your display changing

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:23,890
multimedia functionality network

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,840
settings themselves can instead of going

00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:28,090
through our little Network applet down

00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:30,340
here you can actually click on network

00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:34,150
settings going through that menu and

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:39,340
you're good to go one of the things that

00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:44,160
was added in for two and was packaged

00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:47,410
kit package kit is a little a little

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,720
controversial because it is one of those

00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,699
features that either works or a dozen

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,519
but what it allows us from a dead

00:12:51,699 --> 00:12:56,709
top point of view is that we can say as

00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:00,160
an application I need to install a

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:03,759
multimedia codec all I have to do is say

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,799
install MPEG support and package kit

00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,470
will go ahead and figure this out what

00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,540
package needs to be installed so I don't

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,149
have to write something that will only

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,749
work on debian or only work on slackware

00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:19,299
I can just say install the codec I don't

00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:21,790
care so it's these free desktop

00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,919
standards have helped us integrate

00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:29,889
tighter with the desktop and improve the

00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:31,509
desktop experience for end-users some of

00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:34,720
the other things that we have again is

00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:38,259
this multimedia multimedia with phonon

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,069
is a new technology as some of you may

00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:46,779
have known with the 3 series we had arts

00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:49,059
arts was analog real-time synthesizer it

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:52,749
was not analog it was definitely not

00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:55,149
real time any kind of did synthesis so

00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:58,589
we got rid of it we replaced it with a

00:13:55,149 --> 00:14:02,079
new architecture called phonon phonon is

00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:04,299
more future proof than arts ever was we

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,699
use multiple backends right now we have

00:14:04,299 --> 00:14:09,850
the ability to use gstreamer ensign

00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:13,660
there's a VLC backend and there's also

00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:16,869
work on an NMM back end these allow us

00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:19,959
to pick whatever audio server is or

00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:22,839
audio codecs decoder is popular this

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:26,289
week that makes it so that as a desktop

00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,730
user you don't have to worry that two or

00:14:26,289 --> 00:14:30,699
three years from now you're going to

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:33,850
have to disable your audio server just

00:14:30,699 --> 00:14:36,519
so you can listen to mp3s one of the big

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,309
problems we ran into during the tail end

00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,629
of the 35 series is as things like

00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:45,999
pulseaudio server started to take off

00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:52,629
people were using ESD on linux terminal

00:14:45,999 --> 00:14:56,049
services that started to make the sound

00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:58,839
system more problematic we've kind of

00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:01,419
consolidated that in the phone on now as

00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:04,370
an application developer i can again say

00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:06,860
i need to play a video on

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,610
play a sound go do it you figure out the

00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:13,910
code acts as a distribution they can

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,860
then choose what audio player back end

00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:18,920
they want to ship with so that they can

00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,839
keep their codecs consistent if you want

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,910
a license stuff from flu endo you can

00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,700
use their system if you want to use

00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:27,620
ffmpeg you can use that system you have

00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,940
a lot more flexibility as a user and a

00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:34,760
distribution the last part of system

00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:38,630
settings it's very news display we

00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:40,460
introduced in 42 and refining 43

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:44,360
something called I'm going to say it

00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:47,870
wrong k fall it allows us to integrate

00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:50,600
with ex render a lot better detecting

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:53,900
multiple screens being able to figure

00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,490
out resolutions change resolutions few

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:57,010
of you probably saw me fighting with it

00:15:55,490 --> 00:16:03,200
earlier to get it working on the

00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:05,690
presenter here so it's it gives again

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,940
the ability for us to query through

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:10,279
solid and say I want to change the

00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:13,040
screen resolution make it so and then

00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,680
underneath the hood its figured out for

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,630
us so and as a user experience it

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,320
simplifies your experience so you don't

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:25,220
have to fight with expert ex render or X

00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:31,459
randar or mode lines in the X or

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:35,810
configuration file this is a little more

00:16:31,459 --> 00:16:39,200
detail on package kit in the past if you

00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:42,850
are using Ubuntu you had synaptic or

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:45,709
adept slackware has their own system

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:48,320
debian has their own system everybody

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:53,270
has their own way of adding and removing

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:56,720
software with 42 and integration with

00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,089
package kit we have the ability to use

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,520
the backend scan what software is

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:06,110
available scan updates install codex

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,630
Adam remove software from a common

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:12,050
interface we don't have to as que te

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:15,560
have to cater to only debian or only

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:17,250
fedora or only slackware we can just say

00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:19,620
you know we want to be

00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:22,140
as a group we need to make it easy for

00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:26,910
the users to add and remove third-party

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:28,950
software so it's um it it has its faults

00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:32,190
it's not perfect and there are some

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,820
problems with package kit but to be

00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:40,470
honest the alternative is you as users

00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:42,270
have to learn how to run yum or D

00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:45,060
package or any of those ancillary

00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,850
command-line programs this gives us a

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:50,100
consistent way across all platforms so

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,880
if you're using KDE and you need to

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:56,160
install a package you go right into here

00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,240
select what package you want and install

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,250
it same goes for uninstalling so it in

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:09,900
the end in my opinion it makes the user

00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:13,170
experience again more streamlined now

00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,050
back to dolphin dolphin like conqueror

00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:19,290
has the ability to be network

00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:22,350
transparent back in the KDE two days we

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:25,020
introduced something called k io k io

00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:29,130
gives us the ability to deal with remote

00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:31,470
files as if they were local as you can

00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,750
see here in dolphin i select the network

00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,780
tab and i have the ability to browse

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,780
network services this is zeroconf so

00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:42,950
things like your mac will show up

00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:45,840
anything running bonjour will show up

00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:48,300
you can actually see other people on the

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,670
network double click on it and chat with

00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:53,460
them through co-pay i'm going to show

00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:56,670
about that later you can also see your

00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,120
windows shares and most importantly what

00:18:56,670 --> 00:19:02,520
i use is a network folder these are

00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,390
basically network shortcuts that use k

00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:08,850
io and you can put them as icons either

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:11,220
in the sidebar here or they'll show up

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:14,490
in the network folder we support right

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,260
now webdav which is probably one of the

00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,710
most flexible and secure ways to

00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:23,120
transfer files to and from the internet

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:25,590
ftp for those of you still use that

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:27,720
microsoft windows network drives for

00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,929
samba this allows you to make shortcuts

00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,610
into samba shares and

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:37,519
and my favorite one secure shell this

00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,149
allows you to type in a secure go into

00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:43,340
any server that supports ssh login to

00:19:41,149 --> 00:19:47,119
that server and transfer files to and

00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:49,100
from your desktop this is very nice

00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,990
because you don't have to install a

00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:55,070
custom server you don't have to install

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:57,440
extra ports you just anything with ssh

00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:00,259
installed you're in you got your files

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,649
in you're ready to rock once you've

00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:06,529
selected this you type in your URL click

00:20:03,649 --> 00:20:10,249
Next and it creates an icon on your

00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:13,249
desktop again you'll see meta

00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:17,360
information is present meta information

00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:20,450
is in every app is attachable to

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,009
anything within dolphin and any other

00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:25,340
application that supports this

00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:27,559
information this meta information can be

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:30,019
useful if you want to put network

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:33,200
shortcuts along with your normal files

00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:35,509
you can search based on any means

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:38,119
anything in these tags and find out

00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:42,909
where your files are stored or any

00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,909
network trip any network aware content

00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:55,900
another part of dolphin is the icon

00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:59,740
preview this is some pictures that I

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:02,380
took and this is basically you're able

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:06,010
to enable previews up there and you'll

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:08,799
get a fancy icon previews you can zoom

00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:12,970
the size of the previews down here by

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:15,520
zooming in and out you can also add meta

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:18,159
information you're presented when you

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,549
hover over something with an eye

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:23,950
concrete with a bigger preview here you

00:21:21,549 --> 00:21:28,320
can give it star ratings as well as

00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:30,610
tanks and you can give it descriptions

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,270
now I'm going to talk a little bit more

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:38,620
about the tagging and semantics stuff

00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:41,650
with respects to graphics and more non

00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:43,299
textual information the tagging and the

00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:45,970
rating and descriptions are more

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:48,640
important because let's say I want to be

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:51,159
able to say I want to search for all the

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:54,309
pictures from my Mexico trip so I would

00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:56,940
take these by clicking here and put in

00:21:54,309 --> 00:22:00,220
Mexico trip and I would be able to say

00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:02,380
at a later date I want to find all the

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,530
files with these tags and I don't have

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,730
to worry about doing some funky

00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,760
algorithm to figure out well where are

00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:12,190
these from what date was it what when

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:20,679
when was it I can just file these

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:22,990
pictures away and take them once you

00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,570
have that information you can also go

00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:29,350
into the file manager to the image

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:34,419
manager glenview and get some more meta

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:38,740
information right here I've selected at

00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:40,990
the top there it gives the little bit of

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,909
information about the photo itself and

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:45,760
then there's a more button under the

00:22:42,909 --> 00:22:48,490
more button you have the ability to get

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,890
all of the exif available information or

00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:55,440
any metadata associated with the image

00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,440
this information is available

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,120
through our semantic desktop so that you

00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:06,059
can search on this at a later date the

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,200
searching is becoming more refined in 43

00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:13,380
I haven't been keeping up the status of

00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:16,350
it but it is integrated into every

00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,450
application again you can see the

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:20,940
semantic information you see the rating

00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,309
the description and the tags those tags

00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,070
matchup between the file manager and

00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:27,440
this image viewer so any application

00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,600
that has the semantic information

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,790
present doesn't have to implement it

00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:34,710
itself it's all put into a central area

00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:38,460
it's all centrally stored and shared

00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:41,070
between every application the advantage

00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:44,309
of this is that application developers

00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:46,950
who would like to support semantic

00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:49,230
desktop and semantic information inside

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:52,350
of their application they have the

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,960
ability to go in and just by adding a

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:59,100
few library calls be able to add those

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,140
controls straight to their display and

00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,299
get that information in their

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,730
application on the off chance that

00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:08,850
they're using a custom file format

00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:13,340
outside of normal images or text of good

00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:18,299
example would be a GIS image format or

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:22,350
special data files they can write a

00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:25,710
custom indexing or meta phonetic dated

00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:28,590
extractor that will be installed que te

00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:31,350
whai and become available as soon as it

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:35,520
is installed and the user queries the

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:37,620
file some other information about

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,620
glenview one view is the new image

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,230
viewer it was K view in the que te three

00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:46,350
days and Gwen view came on the scene in

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:50,610
katy for we made it the official

00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:54,030
graphics viewer and kind of removed k

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,190
view Gwen view is neat I'm actually

00:24:54,030 --> 00:25:01,080
giving this presentation inside of one

00:24:56,190 --> 00:25:04,799
view right now it is perfect for dealing

00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:08,070
with large numbers of photos in the

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,929
digit cam is finally ported to 43 but

00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,919
before that happened the only way to

00:25:09,929 --> 00:25:13,590
really manage

00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,769
your photos is glenview it still is very

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:20,309
good if you don't want to put up a full

00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:22,350
photo album and add a lot of custom

00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:28,169
information if you just keep your folder

00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:31,409
hierarchy manually you can just add just

00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:33,450
index them and view them with Gwen view

00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:35,100
when view also has the feature of a

00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,499
thumbnail bar if you click on this

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,109
button across the bottom of the screen

00:25:37,499 --> 00:25:42,779
you're going to see a list of all of the

00:25:40,109 --> 00:25:45,480
list of pictures and the icon previews

00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:48,539
on the bottom we also have the ability

00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:52,889
to do simple image operations we can

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:55,940
rotate queer rotate mirror flip resize

00:25:52,889 --> 00:26:00,960
crop we even have red eye reduction

00:25:55,940 --> 00:26:06,840
there's also the KDE in image

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:11,489
manipulation plugins ki p I of that

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:14,639
actually basically what that allows you

00:26:11,489 --> 00:26:17,249
to do is any image application can plug

00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:19,259
in and say I need to have the ability to

00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:22,889
create an MPEG movie out of a series of

00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:25,159
images so our file manager it has that

00:26:22,889 --> 00:26:29,070
plug in glenview has that plug-in

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,249
digicam has that plugin so I think show

00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:34,649
image also so it's any application has

00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:38,460
all of these image manipulation plugins

00:26:34,649 --> 00:26:40,350
available to it without having to have

00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:42,960
every application install something

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:46,549
different it also lets you use as a user

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,629
use your favorite application without

00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:53,279
sacrificing features that are available

00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:56,039
for everybody else lastly we have the

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,499
file manager operations here we can

00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:01,980
create full create a folder to put file

00:26:58,499 --> 00:27:04,259
images in copy to move to and delete on

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,230
you also if you want to edit the photo

00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:08,879
have the ability to open with and when

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:12,080
you click on that it will bring up one

00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:15,869
of the extra graphics manipulation tools

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:19,739
under linux it's not limited only to

00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:22,710
katie applications you can use gtk

00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:27,190
applications also

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:30,220
so it's Gwen Gwen do as a whole is is

00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:33,039
more complete than KVUE was we also

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:36,070
broke off the features for previewing

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:39,820
files other than raw graphics to another

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:42,880
program called ocular ocular is kind of

00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:46,690
like a pig start out as a PDF viewer and

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,990
then got on steroids it is an awesome

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:53,409
program it can it offers all the things

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:58,120
that k pdf did well with scaling

00:27:53,409 --> 00:28:01,750
resizing text selection copy and paste

00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,549
between things it gave you all those

00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:06,309
features and then they extended the file

00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:14,409
formats it can deal with faxes it can

00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:16,630
deal with I think XPS PDF PostScript it

00:28:14,409 --> 00:28:20,710
is a Swiss Army knife of file viewers it

00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:23,049
is a very powerful tool so that's kind

00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:26,019
of work when view and ocular split off

00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:31,269
from k view as from an applications

00:28:26,019 --> 00:28:36,850
point of view now to everybody's

00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:40,570
favorite part music oh I'm sure

00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:44,350
everybody has very large legal mp3

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:46,480
collections and dolphin again becomes a

00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:50,320
good file manager to deal with these

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,409
based off of the meta information you

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,490
can tag and you can rate your mp3s and

00:28:53,409 --> 00:28:57,610
that's available in the other

00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:59,919
applications you also have actions that

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:05,409
are automatically associated to this

00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,909
file type since this is an mp3 file type

00:29:05,409 --> 00:29:09,159
you have the ability to open with a

00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:12,340
Barack or you can actually go through

00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,070
and do actions again there's a pen to

00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:18,220
playlist a pending play or cue the track

00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:21,820
you can also do things like encrypt the

00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:24,820
file or add to a juke collection juke is

00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:29,139
technically the official KDE audio

00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:32,649
program juke is specifically for tagging

00:29:29,139 --> 00:29:33,919
and managing very very large music

00:29:32,649 --> 00:29:38,730
collections

00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:43,909
amarok is more for playing streaming

00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:48,720
video or streaming audio as well as

00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:53,100
managing it's more like an iTunes type

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,320
of thing without the video it's a good

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,600
it's great for streaming it's it's great

00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,970
for integrating with network stuff has

00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:07,549
plugins it's a neat program but juke is

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:10,769
originally the KDE specific mp3 player

00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:14,190
and it's it's great for dealing with

00:30:10,769 --> 00:30:17,759
large mp3 collections you can actually

00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:22,649
search using a filter bar same one that

00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:28,110
is in dolphin so it's it's a pretty

00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:30,929
flexible application again once you've

00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:35,309
opened this I'm opening this up an

00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:39,049
amarok and amarok too has a lot of new

00:30:35,309 --> 00:30:42,210
features a lot of new interface changes

00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:43,950
the biggest one is that it used to be

00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,679
where the playlist was in the center

00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:49,639
they've actually moved the playlist to

00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:54,000
the side here and as you can see it's

00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:56,159
more compact and it's more information

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,669
than was in the old one when you

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:02,639
activate and start playing an audio file

00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:07,740
the main information ends up in the

00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:10,799
middle the main the application itself

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:14,789
this middle part has the ability to add

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:17,279
plugins I actually have only the album

00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,779
information plug-in installed but you

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:24,169
can actually install things like

00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:24,169
browsing from Wikipedia lyrics plugins

00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,899
media devices and you can have multiple

00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,360
pages of these plugins you can also go

00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:35,100
on you get on the internet and install

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,250
third-party plugins as they become

00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:41,429
available the there in the current

00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:43,289
amarok community is a very alive set of

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:47,070
plug-in developers who have been adding

00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:49,590
scripts and features to amer so as of

00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:55,620
audio player it really is becoming a

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:57,450
very powerful to audio playing a piece

00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,299
of software but it also has a great

00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,429
community that's very alive and adding a

00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,259
lot of new features all the time the

00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:07,350
cool thing is since these features are

00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:12,179
plugins they can come out later and the

00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:14,970
bass amarok can be out now amarok also

00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,519
has the ability to edit tags it gives

00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:20,610
summary information has the ability to

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,519
embed lyrics within the mp3 itself as

00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:24,960
well as providing player statistics

00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:28,649
depending on how often you listen to

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,679
something or whether or not you've rated

00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:34,049
it high or low one of the neatest

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,269
features i like about this one is it

00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:38,789
allows you to guess the tapes from a

00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:41,669
file names so if I've named it correctly

00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:44,879
but never populated the meta information

00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:46,649
it can guess that Duke is a little

00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:49,080
better they actually integrate with

00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:51,860
musicbrainz and a couple other program

00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:56,100
online features so that you can

00:32:51,860 --> 00:33:00,350
fingerprint the mp3 and then it will

00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:05,009
guess to take information from there on

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:08,480
we also have the ability to save this

00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:11,220
meta information as well as clear it out

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,860
one of the neatest features of amarok

00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:18,240
that i found is the ability to deal with

00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:21,000
Internet media as you can see the new

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,789
amarok has the ability to do shoutcast

00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:30,750
it has the ability to have bookmarked

00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:38,309
streams jamendo.com libera librivox org

00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:41,419
and magnitude these are online services

00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:44,070
that allow you to either purchase mp3s

00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:49,490
download streaming media and play it on

00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:52,470
or to be able to just download podcasts

00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:55,649
this is very handy because I can keep

00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:57,870
bookmarks of the favorite podcasts and

00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:59,040
shout casts and keep them in their own

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,620
playlists and come

00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,410
back to them at a later date playlists

00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:08,640
can be managed from this tab here and

00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:10,560
you it's just like the old classic amber

00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,230
ox playlist they didn't change that to

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,050
radically and then lastly there's a file

00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:19,160
browser and devices where you can deal

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:21,660
with pluggable media like your iPod or

00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:26,130
any other media player that you have

00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:30,000
that shows up as a USB Drive again we

00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:31,830
have the plugins here and lastly you

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,800
have the ability to zoom in and out

00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:37,860
there's up to four pages of plugins that

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,630
you can add and the zoom out allows you

00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,050
to see all of them at once or you zoom

00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:51,870
in and you only see this first page this

00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:54,870
the one page you're looking at now on to

00:34:51,870 --> 00:34:59,550
chat the thing that we all love to do

00:34:54,870 --> 00:35:04,860
after we're done listening to music kopi

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:07,800
is advanced is an advanced chat program

00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,680
it allows you to use multiple protocols

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,710
at the same time it also sports a few

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,440
plugins that allow it to extend the

00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:22,350
application quite a bit the feature that

00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:25,230
I love the most is if you at work we

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:28,770
need to be able to move talk to each

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:31,170
other and we don't always have the

00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:32,820
luxury of going through a IM or jab or

00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,640
we want to use something secure on the

00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,280
network on our internal network so we

00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,810
have support for bonjour it's the second

00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,850
one from the top it's the same thing

00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:45,870
that Apple uses for their peer-to-peer

00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:48,090
chat on the local area network basically

00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:50,580
what it allows you to do is you set up a

00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:53,070
bonjour account it advertises you on

00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:56,370
zero cough and then you can actually

00:35:53,070 --> 00:36:00,660
chat between two different users over

00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:02,550
this protocol not the most secure once

00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,170
you leave your own network so it doesn't

00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,240
it doesn't really work over a wide area

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,070
network for those you're going to want

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,049
to use one of the other formats we have

00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:16,519
a IM groupwise we

00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:22,249
have same time for lotus people we also

00:36:16,519 --> 00:36:25,039
have listened windows live and jabber

00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:27,589
jabber is probably the most flexible one

00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,749
because that will work with google talk

00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:31,849
it will work with I talk and it will

00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:35,119
work with your own custom job or servers

00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:37,999
so if you're lucky enough to have access

00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,369
to one of those this is probably one of

00:36:37,999 --> 00:36:44,269
the better check lines to deal with this

00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:46,189
also supports rich text encryption we

00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:51,049
can encrypt each message that goes

00:36:46,189 --> 00:36:53,929
across the wire we have the ability to

00:36:51,049 --> 00:36:58,029
add rich text highlight messages adding

00:36:53,929 --> 00:36:58,029
notes to your contacts information

00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:05,209
piping messages through an external

00:37:01,579 --> 00:37:08,569
script now listening to tell people what

00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:11,920
you're actually listening to now and for

00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:16,999
the four of us who actually use latex

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:19,569
you can actually embed mathematical

00:37:16,999 --> 00:37:22,429
functions we also support webcams

00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:26,630
multiple styles of the chat window and

00:37:22,429 --> 00:37:29,900
the ability to change the status and

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:32,119
behavior of your chat client you can

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:36,739
also change the format of your main chat

00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:38,989
window as well as your icon and you can

00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:46,039
set your away message as well as your

00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:48,349
status one other path look one other

00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:52,219
application in our information

00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:57,640
management suite is contact contact is

00:37:52,219 --> 00:38:02,269
an app is it a combination of K mail

00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:08,329
kind of k organizer k address book and

00:38:02,269 --> 00:38:11,029
job k johns this here is the calendar

00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:13,939
it's a basic calendar that gives you the

00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:17,329
ability to browse the days of the week

00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:20,779
add events remove events view events set

00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:22,369
alarms etc by default we shipped with a

00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:25,039
default calendar as well as the

00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:25,520
birthdays plugin birthdays plugin is

00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,890
entertain

00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,200
because that allows you to scan through

00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:32,240
your address book find out who's

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,570
birthday is when and post it on your

00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:40,370
calendar we also support various other

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:43,520
plugins we have the ability to get stuff

00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:46,760
from the XML feature plan for the KDE

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,060
project this actually reads the xml file

00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:52,610
on the KDE web page and we'll show a

00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:56,150
to-do list of all the things that are

00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:58,910
being done in the KDE project we have

00:38:56,150 --> 00:39:02,450
the ability to journal on a blog we can

00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:07,460
post count calendar journey entries as

00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:09,110
the calendar entries as blog entries we

00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:15,190
have the ability to integrate with scale

00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:18,500
X open change groupwise group tab

00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:21,110
various other features my favorite one

00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,740
is the ability to use a calendar on the

00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:29,260
imap server this is a new feature that

00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:31,670
we introduced in the KDE 3 series colab

00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,850
this allows you to actually take

00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,160
calendar information store it on an

00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:39,890
external imap server and share it with

00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,650
other people through shared I'm app

00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:45,920
folders this gives you the ability to

00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:49,250
share contact information but to use

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:52,690
something like I map with access control

00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:56,060
lists user accounts shared folders

00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:58,340
indexes sieve filtering all these other

00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,020
features that are pain in the butt to

00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,290
implement if you want to roll your own

00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:07,400
server we can use imap an existing

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:09,800
protocol to do the same thing webdav is

00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,740
also very handy especially if you want

00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:19,010
to post your iCal format on an external

00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:24,020
HTTP server the next part of contact is

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:25,640
the address book once you can set events

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:28,640
you want to be able to invite people to

00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:32,090
your address book again we support

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,460
plugins we have your basic information

00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:37,490
where Stuart stuff is stored in an ical

00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:38,480
or a vCard file on your local file

00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:42,800
system

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:47,030
you can also choose group dev novell

00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:51,050
groupwise ldap open change but you can

00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:52,970
also do again the IMAP folder this is

00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:55,460
again very handy because if you want to

00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:57,710
share in address book between multiple

00:40:55,460 --> 00:41:00,109
people you set up the shared folder on

00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:04,010
your imap server and store your address

00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:06,590
book right in there so it's it's a handy

00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:08,510
feature to have one of the other things

00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:13,640
that's very nice about our address book

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:17,720
is that you can add custom in for custom

00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:22,100
tags and custom information so that you

00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:23,840
can actually design forms similar to the

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:28,119
way outlook does forms you can add a

00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:34,730
custom form with custom information and

00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:36,680
search and index based off of that the

00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,770
last part of the information sweets i'm

00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:43,130
going to talk about here is acre gator

00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:45,590
this is an RSS feed viewer it has the

00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:48,890
ability to download and manage multiple

00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:51,020
feeds index them and save them you can

00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:53,990
then browse them similar to your the

00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:56,300
rest of the email clients and read the

00:41:53,990 --> 00:42:01,790
rich text here you can also double click

00:41:56,300 --> 00:42:04,220
and go to the web aggregator I should

00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:07,700
also say all of these applications are

00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:10,670
available as separate applications so if

00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:14,510
you don't want to actually install all

00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:16,580
of the if you just want email you can

00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:19,460
install just came out and ignore the

00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:23,300
rest same goes for the address book or

00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:25,670
the calendar you can just use the single

00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,310
application we just merge them together

00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:31,210
into contact to make it easier to

00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,210
configure and manage

00:42:38,499 --> 00:42:45,920
okay I guess I'll I guess I stopped with

00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:48,950
this slide um I want to talk a little

00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,960
bit about the time tracker and pop of

00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:54,019
notes and then take any questions here

00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,660
um basically the pop of notes and the

00:42:54,019 --> 00:42:58,549
notebook indicate time tracker time

00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,769
tracker integrates with your calendar

00:42:58,549 --> 00:43:02,869
you can actually say I worked on this

00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:05,329
from here to here it shows up in your

00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:08,720
calendar you can also track that against

00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:11,630
estimated time one of the neat things

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,960
about it is that you can match it up to

00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:17,930
your virtual desktops so if I have two

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,730
or three desktops and I do my software

00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,819
development on this one and web browsing

00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:25,130
on the other I can make it so that it

00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:28,579
only marks the time for when I am

00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:34,309
actually using the coding virtual

00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:36,980
desktop the pop-up notes are Andy again

00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:40,249
those are able to be sort stored on the

00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,749
imap server or on multiple backends this

00:43:40,249 --> 00:43:46,700
allows you to share this information

00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:49,489
between different users and groups so

00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,710
that's about it for contact and that's

00:43:49,489 --> 00:43:54,650
about it for the application stack that

00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:57,259
i have here to talk about today at this

00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,569
point do people have any questions or

00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:06,289
anything that that they want me to

00:43:59,569 --> 00:44:10,940
revisit yes sir at this point I think

00:44:06,289 --> 00:44:14,809
it's pretty much widespread 42 is stan

00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:19,960
is the new standard 40 was a technology

00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:22,970
preview and 41 was kind of like the 40 I

00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,160
actually myself transferred from

00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,400
three-foot stopped 35 development and

00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:32,660
went to forex development in February so

00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,119
it's it's mature it's quite usable I use

00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:38,319
it as my day day-to-day desktop and

00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:41,269
development desktop at work it's

00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:44,480
performance is better than 35 feature

00:44:41,269 --> 00:44:46,460
set is better and we have a lot of neat

00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,210
things in the pipeline that we just

00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:50,119
could not do

00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:52,690
with 35 so it's I would recommend the

00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:55,700
people who are thinking about upgrading

00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:58,450
42 is worthwhile I think all the major

00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:02,240
distributions have it in there right now

00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:08,750
43 is on its way so it's a good time to

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:11,599
upgrade yes sir I didn't have time to

00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:17,119
get into K office here but k office is

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:21,650
release the it's released right now the

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:25,190
cool thing about it is that k office has

00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:27,800
the ability to read the ODF format so if

00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:29,839
you want to use openoffice you can if

00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,349
you want to use k off as you can they

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:35,570
can share data between them open office

00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:38,900
has more features but is a little slower

00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:42,320
k office has less features but is a lot

00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,690
faster so it has its trade-offs Krita is

00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:47,359
also a very good image editing program

00:45:44,690 --> 00:45:55,730
for those of you are interested I would

00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:58,820
check it out yes sir right now it's

00:45:55,730 --> 00:46:04,280
stored by an internal database or data

00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:07,730
file per se yes in there so it's it's

00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:12,680
per user it's not disseminated around

00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:14,839
the rest of the file system not at this

00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:18,290
point but I could see use cases where

00:46:14,839 --> 00:46:22,280
selective sharing would be interested so

00:46:18,290 --> 00:46:24,490
I have time for one more question yes

00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,490
sir

00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:43,400
yes yes we are yes we are we are

00:46:40,279 --> 00:46:45,349
extending that and we are in 43 we're

00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:47,029
adding more search abilities plus

00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:50,449
there's the ability to write custom

00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:53,989
plugins so you can add new meta

00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:55,819
information as you see fit so all right

00:46:53,989 --> 00:47:02,420
thank you very much for your time in

00:46:55,819 --> 00:47:04,339
your interest and stop by the KDE booth

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,739
if you want to see more in-depth demos

00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:11,109
or you have more in-depth questions I'll

00:47:06,739 --> 00:47:11,109
