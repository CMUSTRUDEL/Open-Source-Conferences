the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,359
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,740
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,049
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,180
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:23,100
southeast linux fest org so why are we

00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:25,080
here that's it's a sort of rhetorical

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,449
question I always ask whenever I come to

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,309
a bunch of linux / open-source geeks you

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,780
know and there's you know some

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,840
conferences i come to they're there

00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,370
because it's their job and you know they

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,600
work for living and they you know need

00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:43,079
to find out the latest and greatest as

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,809
such and such so that's fine but that's

00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,660
not why I'm here I've been at Red Hat

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,190
for eight years now and in that time

00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:53,100
I've done reasonably well for myself

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,160
I've seen red hat grow from from the

00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,559
little upstart company to the you know

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:05,280
the Microsoft of Linux to the enterprise

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:06,930
software company why I am here and I

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,530
suspect that this is true of many others

00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:13,590
as well is that I see open source free

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:17,909
and open source software as a social and

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:21,990
public good okay i am in a unique

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:25,380
position for which I'm grateful wherein

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:27,770
I can work for a large company that pays

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,409
me to sort of connect the dots between

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:33,210
large enterprise customers who make tons

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:36,360
of money using our product that's based

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,579
on open source and the sort of global

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,790
community that builds that software

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:44,220
commons right but I live over here on

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,750
this side with that global community

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,170
right that's that's what I do for a

00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:51,479
living um and the reason that I continue

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,399
to do this for a living is because I get

00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,250
to spend most of my time on that side of

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,180
the ledger right and that also allows me

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:04,560
to concentrate and and hopefully with

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:10,400
look lead the solutions to problems that

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:13,800
matter to me all right i guess it was

00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,900
2005 when i was i was in india at

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,900
Prince with my friend Chris blizzard at

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,060
Red Hat and it was during that

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,800
conference that Chris got the word that

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,760
he was going to be leading the

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,560
development of an operating system

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:35,430
derivative for the One Laptop Per child

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:38,910
project and we're a ways down the path

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:42,060
now with OLPC and we see it in hindsight

00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:45,380
and we see a lot of the problems that

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,660
sort of have plagued the olpc project

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:52,470
and it's easy to look at those problems

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,510
and not look at what it is that olpc

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,160
accomplished and I'm going to presume

00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,110
that that most of you in here are at

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,330
least familiar with OLPC if you're not

00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,630
the young man there in the corner has

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:06,420
one that is the XO laptop that is the

00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,420
the product of the one laptop per child

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,240
foundation that cost less than two

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:15,000
hundred dollars to manufacture four

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:17,700
years ago the notion of a laptop that

00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,410
would get any traction that caused less

00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:23,340
than two hundred dollars manufacturer

00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:25,020
was ridiculous right it simply was not

00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,180
something that anyone thought would ever

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,520
happen it was a well intel's going to

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,930
step in and such as soons are going to

00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,970
happen you're going to be ground into

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,400
the dust under the boot heels of intel

00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,870
and what happened was that Intel said

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,170
well we better figure out how to make

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,910
something cheap and so they did right

00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:45,090
and so the opportunity for you guys to

00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:46,920
get asus Tripoli's or you know the next

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,470
version of whatever whatever it is that

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,090
that you'll be getting at some you know

00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,160
subnotebook kind of size and price point

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,620
of you know the two hundred dollar range

00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:58,170
is largely in part of this sort of

00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:01,860
insane vision of nicholas negroponte e

00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:08,880
at OLPC made possible in large part by

00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:10,320
the existence of free software right so

00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,940
I got involved with this as early as

00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:13,590
possible because you know I wanted to be

00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,910
part of the revolution when it happened

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,080
I started writing articles for redhat

00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:21,900
magazine in 2006 I actually came down to

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:26,250
South Carolina to Greenville sometime in

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,600
2006 where maybe it was 2007 to actually

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:29,610
talk about one laptop

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,010
child and met a lot of folks here in

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:36,090
South Carolina who have actually become

00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:40,590
fairly instrumental in in moving the one

00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:42,930
laptop per child mission forward and and

00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,490
you know as time went on it became clear

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,080
that Oh a PC needed a more community

00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,550
focus and because that's what I did at

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,630
Red Hat that's one of the things I tried

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:53,400
to help but well pc with it's a funny

00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,410
thing one of the worst things you can do

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,330
in open source software is to get people

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,340
really excited about your project and

00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:01,530
then when they show up to help and say

00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,140
what can I do you say well I'm not sure

00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:06,300
come back later all right olpc was very

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,210
guilty of that and I think it led to

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,590
some some of their problems and

00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,930
ultimately it led to the creation of a

00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:15,750
separate organization called sugar labs

00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:18,900
and sugar Labs is now actually the

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:21,000
software organization that carries the

00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,370
mission of making the software on that

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,650
little device more and more awesome over

00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:27,750
time and not only that but making sure

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:30,030
that that software runs not only on that

00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:33,090
XO laptop but on other hardware

00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:35,220
platforms as well so I work with those

00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:39,510
guys and the reason for that is I

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:42,330
believe in free educational materials

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:48,000
for everybody all right that's what I

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:50,070
believe in it may be quixotic but I

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,410
think less than less than people might

00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,700
have once thought and I think that olpc

00:05:52,410 --> 00:06:02,040
is a step to that a destination all

00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:03,600
right so and if you can't see this in

00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:05,760
the back I apologize i'll write as big

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,690
as i can in the small board i have this

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,280
is free or i'm sorry this is where we

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:17,040
are this is the current educational

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,260
system and this is the brave future

00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,220
where we have freely available

00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:24,690
educational materials that are actually

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:28,680
useful to students kids teachers parents

00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:33,510
everybody and what olpc did was move us

00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:35,790
from here to about here all right and

00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,250
one of the things that's important about

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,800
olpc is that we have learned as much

00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,400
from its failure from its failures as we

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,290
as we

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,370
from its successes you know its

00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:50,780
successes were considerable but there

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:50,780
are some other things we learned as well

00:06:52,370 --> 00:07:06,630
one thing that we learned is that

00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:09,300
schools work a lot like factories I'm

00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:11,340
presuming you were all products of the

00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,630
the American educational system most of

00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:18,000
you you have grades 1 through 12 and

00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:20,789
those grades basically take in standard

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,830
inputs and standard outputs right and

00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:27,479
there's one teacher who is responsible

00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:32,630
for teaching 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 kids

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:35,280
and there's not really a lot of room for

00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:37,880
individual attention there's not a lot

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,970
of room for different learning styles

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:44,610
and that's simply that's simply that's a

00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:46,740
historical artifact right it's not it's

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:48,449
not a bad thing it's not the teachers or

00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,760
bad people it's not that administrators

00:07:48,449 --> 00:07:52,650
don't care about these kids is that it's

00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,840
that schools are built on a nineteenth

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:58,650
and twentieth century industrial

00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:00,389
revolution model that predicates you

00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,979
build these great big cities and you put

00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,449
these great big schools in and you pump

00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:05,070
as many people in as you can and then

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,370
you pump out citizens at the other end

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:11,099
right in the industrial revolution that

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,409
was a revolutionary model this model is

00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:16,789
what allowed us to move into the modern

00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:19,770
era and teach all of these kids right

00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:23,070
but we live in a different era now we

00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,620
live in the era of the internet where

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:32,250
this model may not be so relevant

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:39,180
anymore all right and this sort of begat

00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:43,380
the gigantic textbook publisher who

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,690
works in economies of scale you don't

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,420
write a textbook unless you're convinced

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,420
that you can sell it to hundreds of

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,029
school districts so that you are serving

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,620
hundreds of thousands of kids if you

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,990
can't

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,570
a textbook that is going to be able to

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,700
be used in a lot of these factories you

00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:03,230
don't bother writing it at all and so

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,600
what that means is that there is a

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:10,279
textbook industry that has a great

00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,600
amount of pressure to produce the the

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,290
stuff that is going to be the most

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,760
useful for the most people right and

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,580
then on top of that we've got this thing

00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,500
called No Child Left Behind all right

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:26,480
are there any teachers in here any well

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:28,700
teachers can tell you that No Child Left

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,630
Behind has been one of the most painful

00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,790
things for them and for kids because we

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:39,380
are putting unreasonable pressure on a

00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:43,100
system to create results that are

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:47,110
designed to sort of unify you you make

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,180
education more uniform right now schools

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,220
before No Child Left Behind they had

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,110
broader objectives as well they needed

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,270
to get the grades but not only do they

00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,130
need to get the grades they also needed

00:09:56,270 --> 00:10:00,260
to provide kids with broader

00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,680
opportunities opportunities in the arts

00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:07,010
and humanities you know extracurricular

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,050
activities of various kinds and No Child

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,640
Left Behind which was certainly you know

00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:17,270
well-intentioned had the side effect of

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:20,450
concentrating all of those resources to

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:22,610
passing a test right and any resource

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:26,120
that wasn't directed towards passing

00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,790
that test had to be let go or repurposed

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:32,690
right so you've seen music programs and

00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:35,240
art programs disappear you know not so

00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,370
much from the big schools that that you

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,660
know that are doing well but from the

00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:40,339
places where some of this stuff is

00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:42,920
needed the most the small schools the

00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,209
rural schools where these kids have few

00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,630
of a few enough of these opportunities

00:10:44,209 --> 00:10:49,670
as there are and then when you refocus

00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,120
the one or two foreign language teachers

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:55,430
or music teachers you know to passing

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,110
the test these kids then have no

00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:58,580
opportunities at all to see anything

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:05,480
other than whatever is in the No Child

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:08,720
Left Behind path right and the thing to

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:13,360
understand is that this status quo

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:18,009
is actually well described in business

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,009
it is known as the innovators dilemma

00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:23,839
anyone familiar with this innovators

00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:26,600
dilemma so it's a book by Clayton

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,339
Christensen who's a professor at the

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:34,250
Harvard Business School and he talks

00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:36,550
about how innovation happens okay you've

00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:39,500
got a big business makes a lot of money

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:43,250
serves a lot of customers does a pretty

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:48,079
good job let's say a carriage business

00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:49,879
in the 1910s right the teens that's a

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:53,389
very profitable business you're making

00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:56,269
carriages that horses pull along um you

00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:58,610
know and if the cook if you the Henry

00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,860
Ford quote is if I had asked the

00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:08,689
customer what he wanted he would have

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:11,810
asked for a faster horse alright this is

00:12:08,689 --> 00:12:15,139
how innovation works somebody has a good

00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:17,480
idea that serves someone who is not in

00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:20,089
the mainstream that is being served by

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,980
this market they find some niche market

00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,259
and they serve the people in these niche

00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:27,259
market these niche markets and those

00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:30,230
niche markets emerge to such a point and

00:12:27,259 --> 00:12:32,360
the product which is free to innovate

00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:35,720
because it's not beholden to this entire

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,670
set of customer requirements the

00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:40,009
innovator can move quickly enough that

00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:42,350
the innovation becomes good enough for

00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,879
this set of people and then the time

00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,579
comes where there's a great big sea

00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:48,500
change and suddenly there are enough car

00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,839
factories to produce all of these

00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,930
automobiles that overnight make the

00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,300
carriage industry obsolete right now

00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:57,680
unfortunately Detroit is going through

00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:59,660
the next version of that innovation

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,670
cycle now and it's very painful for

00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,620
everybody involved and it's always very

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:07,339
painful for everybody involved that's

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,649
the nature of innovation right the

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:12,889
problem is that this is a factory right

00:13:09,649 --> 00:13:15,860
and this model is no longer the most

00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:20,679
efficient model so why am I talking

00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:20,679
about this I'm not a teacher I'm a geek

00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,880
well the reason I'm talking about this

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,940
is because the geeks have been here

00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:36,710
before right because if you take away

00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:45,860
all this and you alter this factory a

00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:49,880
little bit it looks suspiciously like a

00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,200
cathedral does anybody know what I mean

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,890
when I say that it looks like a

00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,570
cathedral so maybe some of you have read

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,440
the paper the cathedral in the bazaar by

00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:02,480
eric s raymond in the software world

00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,970
we've been here before and we were we

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:10,250
were here basically first okay uh an

00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:12,470
entire industry was built up around the

00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,690
production of software that demanded

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,940
that software had to scale in a certain

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,220
way to be cost-effective it had to be

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,290
built by one person who figured out all

00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,090
the stakeholders it had to be built in

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:25,250
such a way that it was sold to lots and

00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:29,420
lots of customers or it was not useful

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:31,610
right open source software and the

00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:34,070
modular nature of open-source software

00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:37,180
development which is small pieces

00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:40,130
loosely joined has over time

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,980
revolutionized the software industry to

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,320
such a degree that now it is a given

00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,720
that open source software in certain

00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,490
circumstances does in fact produce

00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,560
better software than the proprietary

00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:53,390
counterparts right now it's not

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,360
necessarily always true it's not true in

00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,040
every case you know there's some things

00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,470
that proprietary software is still

00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:06,320
better at and that's fine so we've been

00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,460
here before I think that concludes part

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,660
one now I'm going to go get another

00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:10,660
piece of paper and read from that

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,640
so if the question is how you create

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:24,250
that disruptive force open source

00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,430
software gives us some ideas about how

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:42,820
that might work okay so now we're going

00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:46,600
to talk about modularity modularity does

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:50,260
anyone know the the guidelines that

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,760
Linux is built around anyone were to

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,910
Linux conference surely someone can tell

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,910
me the standard that Linux well I'm

00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:59,470
talking about before that actually i'm

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:02,500
talking about POSIX that's what I'm

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,240
talking about if I had something if I

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,190
had something to throw to you I would

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,750
you know like a little piece of tray

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,750
there you go but I don't have any schwag

00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:18,780
yes and he can give it to you all right

00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:24,310
unix started life as very proprietary

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:26,470
stuff right and one of the reasons that

00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:28,240
UNIX didn't win in the marketplace was

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,830
because there were all these competing

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,920
uses that beat the hell out of each

00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:37,180
other and nothing emerged from that that

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,310
could stop the the Microsoft beast but

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,740
the nice thing about politics is that it

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:44,260
was an open standard and open standards

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,090
now that now that we understand how open

00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:48,820
source works we all know that open

00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:51,850
standards truly open standards beget

00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:53,470
open source right they lead from one to

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,670
the other and it's actually one of the

00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:56,830
ways you can tell if the standard is

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,540
actually open is if it leads to an open

00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,220
source implementation because if it

00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:02,110
doesn't it probably isn't as open as you

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:05,470
think it's either too big too confusing

00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:08,650
not really open right the ODF spec is

00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:10,810
like 20 pages and the low XML standard

00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,760
is like 300 pages or 3,000 pages or

00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,550
something I just pulled those numbers

00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:17,770
out of my butt but the the the ratio is

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,810
the same right one standard is truly

00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,400
open and and and you can pursue it and

00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,780
the other standard is kind of crazy

00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:25,630
wacko and no one actually

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:32,560
that's it right ultimately posix big at

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:34,090
lenox so the question is is there

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,220
something similar in the education world

00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,320
well there are these great things that

00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:47,470
that they're called curriculum

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:50,110
frameworks all right if you go to any

00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:54,520
state in the Union and you look at their

00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:57,010
educational mission they all center

00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,900
around curriculum frameworks all right

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:01,870
and what this is is it's as great big

00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,970
set of graphs that has in this grade

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,760
these are the things that we expect you

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:08,950
to learn and we'll break those down into

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,690
these little bullet items like you need

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,990
to be able to put numbers on a number

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:16,330
line right or you need to understand

00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:20,170
what a numerator and a denominator is

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:22,330
and the textbook manufacturers you know

00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,490
they work with the curriculum framework

00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:26,260
folks so that they're writing content

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:28,060
that adheres to the curriculum framework

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,740
and they actually work with the

00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,690
curriculum framework people to change

00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,640
curriculum if necessary if you know

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,140
because these these textbook

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,310
manufacturers they're smart people too

00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,500
and they all work together and they do

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,660
the best they can to give us some pretty

00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,020
good frameworks for doing all kinds of

00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:47,350
cool stuff right these are pretty open

00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,470
standards you can go to just like my

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:51,520
favorite is the Massachusetts state a

00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,930
curriculum framework they've got a great

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,610
website they've and they've got all

00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,380
these things and charts you can you can

00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:58,840
follow me you can see what it is if

00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,310
you're interested enough that our kids

00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,080
are supposed to be learning from grade

00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:07,630
to grade but here's the thing those

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:10,900
curriculum frameworks do not have to be

00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,730
used just by textbook manufacturers who

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,820
are looking to maximize their market

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:18,010
share they can also be used by people

00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:20,890
who are looking to build freely

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:24,790
redistributable content by whatever

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:26,680
means they see fit right and textbook

00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,240
manufacturers are nice people and

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:31,180
they're pretty smart but they're just

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,430
people like everybody else a lot of them

00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,660
are very experienced but another thing

00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:36,570
we've learned in the world of open

00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,179
source is that the talented

00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:42,600
amateur especially the passionate and

00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:45,149
talented amateur can produce work that

00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:47,250
is every bit as effective as the work

00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:49,919
made by a 20-year professional in his

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:55,259
field right and I will diverge briefly

00:19:49,919 --> 00:20:00,029
for a story is he here know so i can

00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:03,750
embarrassin um there's a fella who came

00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:05,639
to the Fedora project and volunteered to

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,590
do some wiki work right he loved the

00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:09,960
fidor project he loved what we stood for

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,539
he showed up he started asking what he

00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:15,480
could do you know he noticed that the

00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:17,279
wiki was in kind of a shambles in a lot

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,399
of ways because wikis are in shambles

00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:25,289
constantly because that's just how they

00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:27,809
are there entropy personified you know

00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:30,179
and there were some slow performance and

00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:32,220
this guy started to sort of dig in and

00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:34,470
you know we were deciding to move our

00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,659
entire wiki platform from one place to

00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,519
another and he started working with this

00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:40,620
fellow named Ricky and these guys were

00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,659
just doing amazing work at getting our

00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:44,070
wiki ready to be cleaned up and poured

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,360
it over to this other platform where it

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,090
would run better and be awesome for

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,419
everybody and when we ask these guys to

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:55,409
conferences they both said we'll have to

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:59,909
ask our parents right because at the

00:20:55,409 --> 00:21:02,070
time Ricky was 16 and ian was 15 maybe

00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,240
Ricky was 17 but i'm going to say 16

00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:08,370
because it makes the it makes the story

00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,610
when you're better right I'm of course

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:15,919
I'm right I'm always right thanks man

00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:19,320
right that's the world we live in

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:23,070
distributed development of code and by

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:25,649
extension content when you are building

00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,669
it in the Commons for everyone to share

00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:31,860
is one of the truest meritocracy

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:34,379
meritocracy 'he's that mankind has yet

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,029
developed right there's an old new

00:21:34,379 --> 00:21:39,960
yorker cartoon on the internet nobody

00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:42,000
knows you're a dog right uh let's see I

00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,129
never really got that in the way that I

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,840
get it now until i started routinely

00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:48,720
finding out that the people i was

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,160
working with that i mistook for 20 year

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,350
veterans of industry

00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,570
were in fact you know 16 year old kids

00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:57,000
there was one kid I worked with in sugar

00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:59,700
labs who wouldn't even tell me his name

00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,360
he would just tell me his IRC nickname

00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,350
and I kept asking him and saying look I

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,880
want to I want to invite you a

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,110
conference I want to send you some style

00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,820
wow I've got this book that I want to

00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:10,980
send to you is like I can't tell you who

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:12,930
I am so I came to the natural conclusion

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,170
that he was a spook for the government

00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:18,180
right so I've got it I've got in my head

00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,130
I've got in my head this picture of this

00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:22,140
you know balding and there you know a

00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,360
lot of like us you know mid in sort of

00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,950
late 30s mid 40s looking to do something

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,580
good for the world bored with his day

00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:31,530
job a security professional know the

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,870
reason he wasn't sharing that data with

00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:37,620
me it was because he couldn't legally

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:41,040
share it with me because of coppa which

00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,720
basically specifies what personal

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,660
identifiable information a

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,150
twelve-year-old can share with the world

00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:50,340
right he couldn't tell annette he turned

00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:52,980
13 he's like my names luke fairy on a

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:54,240
blah blah so and so you know and I'm 13

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:55,680
and I'm sorry I couldn't tell you

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,950
because before I was 12 but it was

00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:01,440
illegal for me to tell you who I was

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:04,350
right that's the world of open source

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,230
software right not no joke not no

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:09,270
exaggeration you know and it's you know

00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:12,660
it's also 60 year old professionals at

00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:14,130
the NSA but the representing right I

00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,480
don't know if you're with the NSA but

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:21,540
thank you for raising your hand perfect

00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:22,860
example see I love that story so much

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,740
that I tell it even when it's not in the

00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,070
flow and now I don't know where I am

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:31,500
that's okay so the question is if if

00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,260
this standard led to linux what is this

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,440
going to lead to all right what is that

00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:39,960
going to lead to that is the question

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:41,640
the actionable question that is in front

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,690
of all of us right now who care about

00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,370
education okay I go to the national

00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,810
educational computing conference as

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,760
often as I can it's happening this year

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,930
in DC in a couple of weeks I won't be

00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,550
able to go because i'll be in Europe

00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:55,680
working with sugar labs folks but

00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:59,640
there's a fellow named Steve hargett and

00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:01,830
who runs a forum there that basically

00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,260
it's an open source for I'm in neck

00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,570
right

00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:07,520
and neck the national educational

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,880
computing conference is the biggest

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,010
conference of teachers who come and see

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,140
what the latest and greatest software is

00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:17,900
out there every year and you've got the

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:19,340
huge proprietary software companies

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:22,550
telling them all the greatest stuff

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:25,820
right blackboard does gigantic business

00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:27,890
there every year and so five years ago

00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,080
Steve basically fought his way in tooth

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:33,130
and nail to get a table and a room that

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,540
would seat like 30 people and that has

00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:38,330
between doubled and tripled in size

00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:40,130
every year and every year it's clear

00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,100
that the space that he has isn't big

00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:47,660
enough and every year when Moodle shows

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:49,190
up and starts you know all of the

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,230
teachers want to hear about Moodle and

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,270
the blackboard folks get angry and say

00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:55,640
there's an eight and a half by eleven

00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:58,720
printout of the name Moodle on this that

00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:01,010
violates ana policy take that down right

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:08,840
this is this is the fight that we are

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:11,390
engaged in right now okay so I posited

00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,850
that that we're heading towards the

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,230
bazaar in education so I'd like to take

00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:17,530
a little bit of time to go over what I

00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:20,530
believe the state of that bizarre is now

00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,530
okay

00:25:27,549 --> 00:25:33,250
there are three pieces three key pieces

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,149
that you need to think about when you're

00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:44,269
talking about educating kids you need to

00:25:38,149 --> 00:25:49,659
have the content right this is the stuff

00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:49,659
you teach and then you have activities

00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:55,460
which is the stuff that they do to drill

00:25:54,409 --> 00:25:57,950
into their heads what you've been

00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:59,389
teaching them and maybe the possibility

00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:03,529
for them to sort of self direct and

00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:09,230
learn a little more and then you have

00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:11,809
assessment and assessment is essentially

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,419
how you pass what did you pass the test

00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:16,760
or not do you know the material are you

00:26:14,419 --> 00:26:18,080
going to get promoted to third grade or

00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:20,809
are you going to have to come to summer

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,380
school right in the public schools

00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:25,490
that's essentially what assessment is

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,179
and increasingly it's No Child Left

00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:32,059
Behind influenced as well so what is

00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:35,630
freely available in the free content

00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:38,059
world for anybody to use and remix and

00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:42,440
do interesting stuff with well we've got

00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:44,090
Wikipedia and all of the lesson II stuff

00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,350
that goes with Wikipedia those guys are

00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:47,059
actually doing a pretty good job of

00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:50,210
categorizing as much of that content as

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:52,639
they can there's curry key which is a

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,080
really interesting thing that uh the

00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:55,789
folks that son have been working on for

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,139
a long time when Scott McNealy got

00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:59,029
enough money to not have to deal with

00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:02,870
the problems of son anymore one of his

00:26:59,029 --> 00:27:05,149
passions became karoke and he's on the

00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:06,769
board and you know they they've got a

00:27:05,149 --> 00:27:08,630
lot of these ideas as well and they're

00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:11,330
doing their best to push teachers to

00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:13,399
develop content collaboratively on wikis

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:16,010
to share with one another and you know

00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:17,600
that it's a good idea not bad there's a

00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,389
whole bunch of stuff being used on

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,610
YouTube YouTube has tons of educational

00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:24,289
material that people are just uploading

00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:26,470
what you'll notice that's common about

00:27:24,289 --> 00:27:28,429
these things is that they are

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,960
infrastructure made available that

00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:33,289
teachers basically decide to use on

00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,629
their own right there is no school board

00:27:33,289 --> 00:27:37,970
mandating you should be pulling content

00:27:35,629 --> 00:27:39,440
from here and there they mandate the

00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:41,960
book they mandate the crew

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,759
Rick ulam and the teachers who recognize

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,860
the shortcomings of these approaches are

00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,870
constantly looking for new innovative

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,730
ways to do things within the

00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:54,110
restrictions that that they have to deal

00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:55,759
with right and this is all a basically

00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:57,950
infrastructure that allows them to

00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,139
upload their own stuff and you know

00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:02,779
innovate and then there's Google right

00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:04,129
Google is everywhere they don't it's not

00:28:02,779 --> 00:28:05,629
like they're trying to be a content

00:28:04,129 --> 00:28:07,850
provider they're just where everyone

00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:10,129
goes for it all right so so Google and

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:19,789
then there's lots of stuff that is both

00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:22,100
free and not free right so you know one

00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:23,629
task is clearly in front of us is to do

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,149
a better job of categorizing what is

00:28:23,629 --> 00:28:28,100
free and not free why that even matters

00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:29,649
because educators are fairly early in

00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:32,659
this game they don't necessarily

00:28:29,649 --> 00:28:34,879
understand why it matters to have a

00:28:32,659 --> 00:28:37,250
Commons that is freely redistributable

00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:39,470
so that people can take your content and

00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:41,179
revise it and make it better you know a

00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:43,279
lot of teachers who sort of get the

00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:46,700
value of receiving all of this awesome

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,679
free content don't yet understand what

00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:52,090
it takes to produce and make that free

00:28:48,679 --> 00:28:54,889
content better which is essentially the

00:28:52,090 --> 00:29:00,080
the free content licensing model that

00:28:54,889 --> 00:29:07,879
drive software so let's move over to

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:15,570
activities lots of stuff that's I would

00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:22,840
describe as man yeah

00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:25,840
um there weren't enough computers in

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,220
classrooms to have really spawned an

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:34,139
industry here that's really all that

00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:37,419
relevant right and and no real industry

00:29:34,139 --> 00:29:39,070
partner wants to get involved with this

00:29:37,419 --> 00:29:41,710
because you're not talking about going

00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:43,330
to the the federal government and saying

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,090
I've got this great thing that I'd like

00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:47,859
to to put into you know 100,000 schools

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,179
worldwide now they've got to talk to

00:29:47,859 --> 00:29:52,179
every one of those hundred thousand

00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:56,320
school systems themselves right it's

00:29:52,179 --> 00:29:58,210
incredible pain in the ass if you've

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,789
ever sat in one school board meeting or

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:03,190
even watched one on TV you don't want

00:30:00,789 --> 00:30:08,039
none of that you know that's crazy talk

00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:08,039
all right and and when we talk about a

00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:14,769
an entrenched bureaucracy that's what

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:16,480
we're talking about when we talking

00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:20,590
about the notion of disruptive

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:24,759
innovation so there is a book and as

00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:27,279
I'll come back to that and then

00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:32,619
assessment there's nothing free about

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:36,279
assessment no sir nothing no thing nada

00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:39,220
why is that because assessment is a

00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:40,600
government-run thing right the

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,659
government is going to tell you whether

00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,649
your kid has passed or failed and I

00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:47,710
don't want to sound like one of those

00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:51,220
crazy gun-totin libertarian types you've

00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:53,200
government's bad but the fact is that

00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:55,720
the government default for the public

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,429
education system this is this is where

00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,929
it's at right and No Child Left Behind

00:30:57,429 --> 00:31:03,999
is all about this and is really out salt

00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:06,999
share another brief story a couple of

00:31:03,999 --> 00:31:09,909
weeks ago I was talking to Washington

00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:12,730
think tank folks I was doing the tour of

00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:14,830
inside the beltway and me long-hair

00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,980
hippie look and me went into the

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:19,330
heritage foundation all right and I sat

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,649
down with those guys and they're like so

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,779
were you mr. de koenigsberger I'm like

00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:24,129
yes I am well we have a meeting with you

00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:27,580
so I guess we have to listen to what you

00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:27,990
say and we were there to talk about open

00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,970
source

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,650
software because you know the government

00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:33,179
gets open source software and now

00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:35,190
they're constantly trying to figure out

00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:37,410
how to change their procurement rules

00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:39,870
and how to get more use out of it and

00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:41,550
how to produce it lots big chunks of the

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:43,170
government get it and so we're trying to

00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:44,670
put together this think tank model that

00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,980
we can talk to all the various policy

00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:50,070
shops in DC to help them along right and

00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,510
the reason that the Heritage folks love

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,190
because it's funny you go to the hill

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,990
and everybody like on the political

00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,059
spectrum they love open source software

00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,710
for different reasons right and the

00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:03,390
reason that heritage folks love it is

00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:05,510
because they know that money collects

00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:07,710
inefficiencies in government right

00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:09,690
sometimes you need to throw a lot of

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:11,910
money at a problem but the more money

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:14,070
you throw at the problem the more you in

00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:15,750
the more you create the wrong incentives

00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:18,390
and create these gigantic inefficiencies

00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,520
and that's our school board and our

00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,140
school system a nutshell and throwing

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,030
more money at it and trying to get

00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,340
results like No Child Left Behind does

00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:28,050
creates even more in efficiencies and

00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,580
just makes teachers less able to

00:32:28,050 --> 00:32:32,220
innovate less able to do the things that

00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,210
they want to do right and the whole

00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:39,059
assessment thing is part of that so now

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:40,710
at the bottom here if anyone cares

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,080
sufficiently about this to do a little

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,780
bit of reading after the fact there is a

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:54,090
book that you should read it is called

00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:57,390
disrupting class okay who who's that who

00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:59,010
where yeah did you oh you mean you've

00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:02,690
done it you didn't read it you've merely

00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:06,270
performed that function all right well

00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:08,550
yeah this common kinship that's how I

00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:12,510
ended up here because I was always doing

00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:14,550
that too it's a book written by one of

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,929
the authors is Michael B horn I always

00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,750
feel badly that I don't remember the

00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:20,309
second author's name but Michael B horn

00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,480
actually commented on my blog when I

00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:22,800
wrote on some of this so that's why I

00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,840
remember his name because he knows mine

00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,250
haha and then the third author was

00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,290
Clayton Christensen who wrote the

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:30,540
innovators dilemma and basically it

00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:32,790
takes the the ideas around the

00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:34,820
innovators dilemma and it puts them in

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:38,070
the context of our educational system

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:40,559
all right and so much of what I'm

00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,730
talking about is knowledge and wisdom

00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,560
gleaned direct

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,430
from that book and if you care deeply

00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:48,450
about this problem as I have come to you

00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:53,490
should you should take a look at that

00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:55,110
book so having written it down I'm now

00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,900
going to immediately erase it just like

00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:07,230
a college professor it won't be on the

00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:11,700
test don't worry uh-huh no no there's no

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:13,710
assessment here because I'm not the

00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,950
government I can assess you but what

00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:20,490
would it matter so I'll keep that up

00:34:16,950 --> 00:34:28,230
here in a little corner content activity

00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:30,270
assessment so uh what then does the

00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,610
bazaar look like well we talked about

00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,830
the the curriculum frameworks right and

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,620
so this is what a curriculum framework

00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:39,570
roughly looks like a drama and I I

00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,880
recognize that a lot of you in the back

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:43,320
can't see this very well may be and I'm

00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,670
sorry for that but this is much for my

00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,110
benefit as yours because if i'm not

00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,090
drawing when I'm talking I don't know I

00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:54,810
I can't I don't know what I think until

00:34:48,090 --> 00:35:00,750
I see what I say so let us take for

00:34:54,810 --> 00:35:03,600
example one small corner of a curriculum

00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:09,680
framework the one that I have chosen to

00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:13,410
think about is fourth grade math okay

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,910
why fourth grade math why not let us

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:18,360
start somewhere the nice thing about

00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:20,190
math curriculum is that assessment of

00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:22,080
math stuff can be pretty clear you know

00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,550
certainly more clear than you know

00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,290
social study I don't know how to assess

00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,870
social studies no idea but i know enough

00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,930
Matt I I I am as this as smart as a

00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:32,460
fourth-grade math student okay so I

00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,530
think I've got a pretty good handle on

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,180
what those what those skills look like

00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:39,660
and the pedagogical stuff doesn't scare

00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,190
me too bad right so there may be a set

00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,950
of these things and on this side we've

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:48,750
got four dot n dot one which is being

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:50,970
able to recognize positive and negative

00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:53,070
numbers right

00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:54,690
and then you've got four in to these are

00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:56,970
all number skills and then you've got

00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:01,200
basic geometry skills like for g one

00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:03,420
which is recognized an angle you know 4G

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,100
to maybe use a protractor I don't know

00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,920
I'm you know I don't know the specifics

00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,360
don't matter in this case what matters

00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,430
is that that all of these things are

00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:17,370
well defined and they are starting

00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:20,930
places for people who are interested in

00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:24,000
writing content and activities to

00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:26,700
produce something that can then be put

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,800
into the commons and be useful for for

00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:31,530
other people around the world right and

00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,870
so as part of sugar labs sugar labs

00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:35,640
being the the entity that's supposed to

00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:38,040
you know write software for the One

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,230
Laptop Per child project and and now has

00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,180
moved beyond that there's a great big

00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,370
mission teaching all of the kids of the

00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:46,470
world is a great big mission and it

00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:48,030
involves you know another things all the

00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:49,650
stuff is in English right now but the

00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:52,650
vast majority of content on the Internet

00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:55,200
is in English and because the licenses

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:56,850
of that stuff are unclear it's unclear

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,400
whether people in other countries have

00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:02,100
the rights to translate that content

00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,050
right and the localization of

00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,540
educational content is one of the big

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,860
sort of green fields you know because

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,720
the chances are that the people who

00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:11,910
figure out this model first are not

00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,730
necessarily going to be us remember the

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:17,460
underserved market idea there's a reason

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:21,120
that negroponte didn't bring the OLPC to

00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,230
South Carolina first all right he didn't

00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,810
bring it to anywhere in the United

00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,670
States first he took it overseas first

00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,160
because he knew that their bureaucracy

00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,940
would be significantly less entrenched

00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:34,020
than our gigantic old bureaucracy I

00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,550
think that was his hope I think in

00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:39,030
reality there was more entrenchment

00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:40,350
there than he suspected uh but he still

00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:44,010
managed to get a million of those bad

00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:46,650
boys deployed in Y and Peru and you know

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:48,930
handfuls of you know Nigeria and small

00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:51,150
pilot projects elsewhere and it was the

00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:54,210
success of those pilots that ended up

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:57,540
having a case to sell 25,000 of these

00:37:54,210 --> 00:38:01,130
units to South Carolina to you know to

00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,130
see to see what we could do with them

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:08,670
so bear in mind that this is all already

00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,710
being done in the form of a text book

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:12,510
but the limitation of a text book is

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:14,130
that first of all it's dead tree where

00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:15,540
it's very expensive to produce all that

00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:17,579
stuff so you have to have economies of

00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:19,319
scale that allow you to ship that print

00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,690
a bunch of them sell them to the schools

00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:25,859
schools have to pay a ton of money to

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:28,980
get these things produced right so

00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:33,089
that's a problem this stuff can all be

00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:35,339
digital all right which there's still a

00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:37,710
cost to produce all this stuff right as

00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:39,930
much as I love being a free Linux hippie

00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:41,280
guy people need to eat people got to pay

00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:44,790
their rent there's nothing wrong with

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,829
that but it doesn't mean that the that

00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:48,510
the economic model has to stay the same

00:38:46,829 --> 00:38:51,240
right this stuff that is currently being

00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:55,290
produced in textbooks can just as easily

00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:58,980
be created in digital format and put

00:38:55,290 --> 00:39:00,690
into the hands of kids if only the kids

00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:02,790
have the opportunity to actually use

00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:04,980
that digital stuff in an unencumbered

00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:07,740
way right kid has to be able to use it

00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:09,960
at school kid has to be able to use it

00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:12,210
at home that one of the ideas behind the

00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:14,310
XO was that it needed to belong to the

00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,839
student so that didn't end up locked up

00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,720
in a lab somewhere at the end of the day

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,220
if the student owned the unit the

00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,319
student would take the learning with

00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:24,030
them right there wouldn't be a digital

00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:26,220
divide problem because the student would

00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:27,690
own the laptop and the cost of a kid

00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,900
breaking or destroying a laptop or

00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:33,119
whatever was you know was conceived as

00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,250
being a cost that you could bear when

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,430
you compared it to the cost of producing

00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:41,640
and maintaining textbooks year after

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:44,130
year after year right but there still

00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:45,569
needs to be content that is available on

00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,000
these computers and that's where we're

00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:50,880
blocking now right and that's one of the

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,470
problems that the XO project has and one

00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,589
of the reasons that they have shifted

00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:57,240
their focus to you now that they've sort

00:39:55,589 --> 00:39:58,890
of solved the hardware problem they're

00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,290
now looking more at the content problem

00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,690
making sure that there is content widely

00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:06,319
available so that's the CPS the content

00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:11,700
piece but the activity piece on a

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:14,119
computer requires geeks all right you

00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:16,310
got to have geeks to write code and

00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,370
there's this sort of disconnect

00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:21,590
between the the world of helpful geeks

00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:23,030
and the world of excited teachers

00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,470
because teachers love this vision

00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:28,130
they're like that's awesome I would love

00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:30,020
to have more tools you give me

00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:31,820
activities that are awesome and a

00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:34,010
developer says okay here's this thing

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,140
I've wrote that's a maze thing and and

00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:39,170
and the teacher says well how does that

00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:41,240
connect to anything I actually do and

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,260
the geek says I don't know I just wrote

00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:46,780
amazed I thought it was cool I thought

00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:49,730
kids would like it here you go you know

00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,800
so this is why 4th grade math exists

00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:56,360
right to sort of bridge this divide in

00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:58,340
one small test case so if you go to

00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:00,080
sugar labs org there's a fourth grade

00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,760
math section of the site where we've

00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:03,530
spelled out one of these I happen to

00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,750
choose the Massachusetts fourth grade

00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:08,270
math curriculum we've got this whole

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:09,980
table mapped out and so there's a

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:11,840
there's a column here that tells you

00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,360
what the what the the the learning

00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,800
objective is and now it's a wiki and

00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,540
wiki's are a mess and it's evolving

00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,010
slowly but it's moving and there are

00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,470
actually contributors in this room who

00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:23,060
are working on it now over here there

00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:25,790
are some people who are saying you know

00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:29,120
what I'm gonna work on this problem so

00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:30,050
um I'll just pick David nalli even

00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,490
though i don't i don't think you're

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,600
actually working on activity you're just

00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:35,450
driving everyone else to work on

00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:37,250
activities um all right in activity

00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:39,770
right and I'm working on this thing

00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:42,170
called dungeons of all right

00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,330
dungeons of and it's you know it's

00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:53,870
going to first attack some peace and you

00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:55,970
know when I have time to finish it so

00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:58,700
what more reasons why this is

00:41:55,970 --> 00:42:01,010
interesting and useful first of all once

00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:04,040
you write one of these activities it's

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:07,040
and you put it out under an open an open

00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,620
license it is the world's to keep right

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:11,630
it doesn't get lost it doesn't turn into

00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:13,070
well you know a first printing that

00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,390
superseded by second printing that

00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:16,120
superseded by third printing in the

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,070
first two printings end up at a landfill

00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:20,930
the digital Commons if you manage it as

00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:24,020
you're supposed to manage it this stuff

00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:28,570
is forever and if it is open and can be

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,960
shared this activity begets other

00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:32,180
activities

00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,920
that can use it as a base that is one of

00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:38,030
the strengths of open source software

00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,859
right and the thing is that this is true

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,740
even for for projects that are basically

00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:44,780
fail right is the great thing about open

00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:48,770
source software is that in every failure

00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:51,200
there is still the seed of rebirth right

00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:54,020
whoever thought that Firefox was going

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,880
to become a dominant player in the in

00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:57,650
the web browser world again you know

00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,980
seven or eight years ago you may have

00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:02,960
had faith sir but it took a true

00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:06,080
believer back then to believe that I II

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,660
hadn't basically just crushed Netscape

00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,190
forever and ever right but because the

00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,900
code was open and because there were

00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:14,570
people committed to making it better it

00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,190
evolved into something that became you

00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,230
know it would be the market leader if

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:20,780
Microsoft wasn't pre-shipping I e on

00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,550
everything in sight but but firefox has

00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,490
a fifteen percent market share and it's

00:43:22,550 --> 00:43:26,900
edits it's what it's it's got a thirty

00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:30,770
percent market share when it is

00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:32,480
preloaded you know people have to go get

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,890
it it's so awesome they're like I got to

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,359
go get it i need tab completion i need

00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,070
this is and you know i need the adblock

00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:38,450
i need all this stuff that I e doesn't

00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:41,089
do because I is still written by the

00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:45,920
same team of engineers going boy they're

00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:47,390
moving really fast all right but the

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,700
problem is you have to get to a critical

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:51,200
mass to get there right and so fourth

00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,330
grade math we need to still figure out

00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:55,970
how to get to critical mass this one

00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:58,310
activity might be set for a learning

00:43:55,970 --> 00:44:01,700
style someone who reads right I'm a

00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:03,560
reader I'm a visual learning guy and

00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:05,780
this is something that educators think

00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:07,460
about a lot learning styles is one of

00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:10,760
those things that all educators

00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:13,550
understand that they need to cater to

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:16,430
but have absolutely no tools to do it

00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:18,890
because of the nature of of the way

00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:20,480
schools work they've got 30 kids they've

00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:21,950
only got basically time to teach what's

00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,839
in the textbook and they see all of

00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:25,520
these opportunities that gee whiz they

00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:27,260
wish they could do something about but

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,790
there's only so many hours in day and

00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:31,220
there's 30 kids those 30 kids needs

00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:33,050
educating if one kid is an auditory

00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,900
learner and another kid is like a

00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:38,030
kinetis tezak learn like learns by touch

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,369
and and manipulating things there's

00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:42,800
absolutely nothing that the teacher can

00:44:40,369 --> 00:44:43,540
do for that kid right but if their

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,900
activity

00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:50,410
is that can be built to to satisfy those

00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:52,570
different learning styles right over

00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:55,090
time this will grow into something that

00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:59,470
is useful and we have to figure out how

00:44:55,090 --> 00:45:02,830
to get over that hump okay I had a good

00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:07,890
thing I was going to next oh one more

00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:11,110
thing is assessment um because a class

00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:13,570
basically has its beginning and its

00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,400
middle and its end and that beginning

00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:18,220
middle and end are the exact same thing

00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:19,930
for every kid then you have to try to

00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,660
educate every kid along the exact same

00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:24,400
path but the fact is that an education

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:26,680
doesn't necessarily need to follow that

00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,120
path it only follows that path because

00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,300
that is the only way that schools are

00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:33,640
currently constructed to handle okay

00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:38,290
because the grade of first through 12 or

00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,780
I'm sorry they said again the lessons in

00:45:38,290 --> 00:45:42,370
the fourth grade all need to be taught

00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:43,990
in a certain order because you need to

00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:46,090
know certain things before certain other

00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:47,740
things but that doesn't mean they all

00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,990
have to be taught at the same speed the

00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:52,870
same way the only thing you need to know

00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:54,930
is whether the kid knows the thing

00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:57,580
before so we can go on to the next thing

00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,050
when it comes to educating progressions

00:45:57,580 --> 00:46:00,670
are the only thing that matter in that

00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:02,170
way to know whether they've done this

00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:05,020
thing so that they can move on to this

00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:08,350
other thing and that's why assessment is

00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:11,620
one of the key pieces that that that we

00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:14,620
need to figure out right so you can

00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:16,420
imagine instead of being like this

00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,920
structure where this lesson leads to

00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:19,660
this lesson leads this lesson leads to

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,820
this lesson and if this kid gets stuck

00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:23,260
here maybe he gets tutoring maybe he

00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:24,910
goes to a Sylvan Learning Center because

00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:27,160
his family has the money to pay for it

00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:30,610
or maybe he ends up working at Burger

00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,380
King right cuz there was just no energy

00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:34,090
to get this kid over the hump and no

00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,190
tools for that kid to help himself get

00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:40,960
over the hump right what if instead of

00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:44,280
looking like this it is a tree with lots

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,280
of individual modules

00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:52,350
with self-directed learning and all

00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:54,320
these kinds of things you know where do

00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:57,660
we see that now does anyone watch TV

00:46:54,320 --> 00:47:01,230
here anyone yeah you're lying you all

00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:05,760
watch TV are we familiar with rosetta

00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:08,880
stone those guys are just printing money

00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,860
right now right and the reason they're

00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,070
doing it is because they are tapping an

00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:18,480
underserved market a market of learners

00:47:14,070 --> 00:47:20,430
who want to learn a language and don't

00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:22,290
have the capacity to find any local

00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:25,770
teachers to teach them that language

00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:28,290
right in high schools we have exactly

00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:29,730
the same scenario if you're a kid who

00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:32,880
goes to high school in Greer South

00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:36,180
Carolina you maybe have spanish and

00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:37,680
french as a foreign language option you

00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,350
may have another one you may not even

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:42,390
have those two you know you may have

00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:44,150
Latin because you know you've got a 50

00:47:42,390 --> 00:47:50,280
year old professor who won't let it go

00:47:44,150 --> 00:47:51,840
all right and it is the root of the

00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:53,640
other two and he continues to make that

00:47:51,840 --> 00:48:01,710
point never insist all right yes we keep

00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:04,290
lad but it doesn't have to be that way

00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:07,410
there is absolutely no reason no reason

00:48:04,290 --> 00:48:10,760
at all why a kid in Greer South Carolina

00:48:07,410 --> 00:48:13,950
shouldn't be able to go to a lab

00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:16,020
somewhere in his school and learn Arabic

00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:19,020
either taking something like rosetta

00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:20,580
stone or taking it online right there's

00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,590
no reason at all the reason is because

00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:26,400
there's not a teacher to teach them

00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:27,750
right so the future I believe and I

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,950
think we're starting to see this and it

00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:31,500
is part of the premise of the book

00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,750
disrupting class go go if you care about

00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,120
this stuff go read it is figuring out

00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:37,080
how to make these kinds of modules of

00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,300
learning that can be taught

00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,980
independently or over the Internet as

00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:43,910
part of some coordinated learning effort

00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:46,590
right and the problem with this is that

00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:50,220
there's not necessarily a local teacher

00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:52,080
who knows this content right we have

00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:53,760
drilled it into teachers that I've got

00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,430
30 seconds that teachers must know

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,290
everything right in this model teachers

00:48:56,430 --> 00:48:59,040
may not know everything right we've got

00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:01,980
teachers

00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,770
that may have to be learning advisors or

00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:07,200
sort of learning tutors right which

00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,300
requires a change that our system isn't

00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,280
able to do right where the underserved

00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:13,590
markets the underscore their their home

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:16,590
schools there after school programs like

00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:19,230
like Sylvan right they are charter

00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:21,210
schools right if we can construct

00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:23,820
something like this for those

00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,560
underserved markets we have the

00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,720
possibility of creating a Commons of

00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:30,390
knowledge using open source and free

00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,070
content that can serve not only our kids

00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:33,930
but the kids in the entire world and I

00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:36,870
wish I had time for questions but maybe

00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:39,540
I don't or i guess I do I don't know do

00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:41,760
I who held up the sign do we have time

00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:49,430
for questions if there are any are there

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:53,040
any questions how do we say yeah no

00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:54,630
we're going slowly right there are some

00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,040
things that we need to figure out that

00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:57,840
underlie all of these things like

00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,250
assessment we don't even have an API for

00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,930
assessment there are some very simple

00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:02,010
things we can do for assessment one of

00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:03,540
the things that teachers want to know

00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:06,600
how long is the kids spending on an

00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:08,430
activity eat that single thing is as

00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,770
predicted is if not more predictive in

00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:13,800
many cases than an actual grade as to

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,720
actual knowledge of the activity so

00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,760
taught you could you could have time as

00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,990
the single assessment factor right now

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,240
and we don't even have an API that

00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:22,680
includes that in sugar right so we

00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,060
continue to work towards those kinds of

00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:25,680
things i'm doing i'm at a conference in

00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:26,970
Berlin next week I'm going to sitting

00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:29,610
down with the course sugar developers to

00:50:26,970 --> 00:50:36,210
talk about some of these things one last

00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:40,680
thing my email address is GD k GD k at

00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:42,630
redhat.com if you are interested please

00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:45,230
email me and I wish I had more time but

00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:45,230
I don't so
