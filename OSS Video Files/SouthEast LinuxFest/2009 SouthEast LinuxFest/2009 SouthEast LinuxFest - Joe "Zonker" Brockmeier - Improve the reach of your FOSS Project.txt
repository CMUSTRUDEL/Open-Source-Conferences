the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,359
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,740
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,049
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:16,230
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:17,720
southeast linux fest org thanks for

00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:19,830
everybody being here this morning

00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,260
usually I kind of dread morning talks

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,609
because you start you don't see quite as

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,800
many people but this is a really good

00:00:23,609 --> 00:00:29,210
turnout thank you what everybody please

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,210
give you organizers a hand

00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,310
Dave I've helped with a couple of fests

00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,720
I've never had to organize the show from

00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:43,880
scratch but they've helped with a couple

00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,800
of shows and it takes a lot of work and

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,420
for them to pull this off and I've

00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,760
worked with the organizers as they were

00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,500
getting things together because i also

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:54,380
have planned events for opensuse and

00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,580
they've done a great job so I hope you

00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,040
all appreciate the work that they've

00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,690
done so my name is Joe brockner most

00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:00,860
friends call me zonkers so if you're

00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,450
wondering later if you want to come up

00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,530
and say hi you can call me so I can you

00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:07,420
can call me Joe whatever you're

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:11,420
comfortable with within those parameters

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:16,190
so I work for novell as the community

00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:20,380
manager for opensuse and so basically

00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:24,350
that means a couple of things that I do

00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,900
pardon me when I get back to my page of

00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:28,460
notes here and so there are a couple of

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,979
things I do is I mentioned one of the

00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,690
things that I do is I organize events

00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:34,520
for open sense of meaning you know

00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:36,920
everything from talking to organizers

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,210
planning which events will go to making

00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,119
sure some of the stuff shows up at the

00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:44,090
shows asking for budget for items to

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,560
throw out which brings me to my next

00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:47,950
point one of my favorite parts of my job

00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,600
is that I felt the audience with things

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:55,310
during my talk so throughout throughout

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,560
the talk I'll be throwing things at the

00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,509
audience so those of you who decided to

00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,039
sit all the way in the back are probably

00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:06,350
going to lose out a little bit so anyway

00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,759
another thing that I do for novell is

00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,270
I'm sort of an unbuttoned if you're

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,590
familiar with that term so I kind of

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,240
work with the community and then I go

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,650
back to novell the community gripes to

00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,910
me and then I go back and write to them

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:21,590
well and so I try to make sure that you

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,180
know what the community needs they

00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:26,050
actually get sometimes it takes longer

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,960
than others but that's part of my job

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,490
also planning some of the infrastructure

00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,530
for example one of the things I worked

00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,890
on over the last year was our trademark

00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:36,090
guidelines and some

00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,550
other things we're trying to get our

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,569
infrastructure straightened out so those

00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:42,959
are some of the things that are working

00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,700
on what are you talking about today is a

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,380
combination of community building and

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,910
marketing basically what you need to do

00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,490
if you're involved with a project and

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,980
you want to try to expand your reach I'm

00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,660
assuming pretty much everybody here uses

00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,400
linux is there anybody here who's on the

00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,330
fence who doesn't use linux doesn't know

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,750
what it is it's ok we'll be nice to you

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,830
raise your hands ok nobody all right so

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,720
I'm assuming the rest of you are here

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,060
because you want to spread lenox and you

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,320
want to see people using it right so

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,120
that's kind of one of the things we'll

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,280
be talking about or your particular open

00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,610
source project and others who open

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,920
solaris folks in the house they don't

00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:26,100
raise your hand okay one guy brave man I

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:28,019
write something like so the point of

00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,550
this talk is I've been looking at this

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:32,489
industry for a long time before i joined

00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:34,620
novello as a journalist and i've been

00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:38,190
running a linux desktop since 1999

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,709
exclusively meaning i do all my work on

00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,440
a linux desktop i install linux on

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,290
pretty much all my systems in you know I

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,940
use linux a lot and I've come to the

00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:51,180
conclusion the chief drums we have right

00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,709
now are not technical they are marketing

00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,239
they are educational they're getting the

00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,209
word out and they're explaining to

00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,690
people what linux is and getting people

00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,700
understand why they want to use it and

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,820
so when you talk about marketing the

00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,640
geeks you usually get kind of a you know

00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,130
that's evil thing but marketing actually

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,340
works this slide maybe just a little too

00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:19,320
ver be in the morning so give you guys a

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:21,950
second starting here chuckles so people

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:21,950
are getting to the end

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:30,460
yeah so basically you know marketing

00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:32,500
actually works whether you realize it or

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,550
not you get marketed to and you get

00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,900
message isn't quite a lot and the

00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,790
message that I have for you right now

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,380
something you want to take home with you

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:43,720
and think about is we are seriously

00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,580
outgunned the other day i was having

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,820
conversation was somebody in IRC and

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:51,460
actually when I looked at Microsoft's

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:55,180
SEC filings and they budgeted i think it

00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,650
was three billion dollars in one quarter

00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:02,800
for marketing for marketing and sales

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:05,470
three billion dollars to give you to

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,620
give you perspective on that if you take

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:11,680
no bells entire income for the year and

00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:14,440
you take red hats entire income for the

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,930
year and you take Canonical's entire

00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,870
income for the year you don't get three

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:21,310
billion dollars so we're seriously

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:23,979
outgunned and that doesn't even that

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:29,229
doesn't even touch out so we've got a

00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:31,240
lot of work ahead of us so basically

00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:33,130
what are we talking about as they start

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,669
at the top reaching as many users as

00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:39,010
possible that means getting our message

00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:40,660
up getting more users and more

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:42,370
contributors you know it's one thing to

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,889
talk to people about Linux it's one

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,539
thing to be it at an event and introduce

00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:49,270
somebody to concept i'm actually using

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:51,310
likes and it's a step beyond that to get

00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:55,060
them to actually contributing to a

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,800
project also on talked about you know

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:02,400
improving the experience for

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,400
contributors a little bit so

00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,710
a lot of WKRP folks in the house okay I

00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:10,330
gave this talk at scale and the audience

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:11,800
was drastically younger so there was

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,710
just kind of crickets when the slide

00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,800
came up you're like this is hot so you

00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,120
guys get what this isn't about all right

00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,240
we're not talking I'm going to get in

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,800
we're handing there's an entire sub you

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,930
know focus of marketing which is

00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,510
branding which I'm not worried about we

00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,330
don't need to get into at the moment not

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:32,290
talking about corporate marketing

00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:34,690
campaigns I'm talking about grassroots

00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,490
marketing definitely not talking about

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:38,050
sales we're you know we're not trying to

00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,660
sell anybody anything we're trying to

00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,430
give them something which what an odd

00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,470
concept if you think about it we've been

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:46,060
trying for years as a community to give

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,780
people living some there's still on

00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,980
defense so obviously we may be doing

00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:55,180
something wrong not talking about spin

00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,710
you know I'm not talking about the thing

00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,930
that people thinks is evil about

00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,700
marketing and PR and i'm not talking

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,850
about selling people something they

00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:05,710
don't need if you take one thing away

00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,050
from this when you talk to somebody if

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:09,730
you have an open source project or if

00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:13,290
you're talking about a linux distro and

00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:15,670
it's not right for them back off because

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:22,230
nothing is worse than giving somebody a

00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:25,720
bad first impression ok so first rule of

00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:28,840
you know improved of getting your reach

00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,090
out there as a project is don't suck now

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,140
I explain why this picture sucks in just

00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:37,270
a minute basically there's absolutely

00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:40,120
nothing you can do if your project sucks

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:41,710
ok no amount of evangelism in the world

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,200
I'm not going out getting in front of

00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:46,900
people in the world is going to have any

00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:48,160
effect some people are brave enough to

00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,780
come in and sit in the front so I'm

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,740
gonna lot of things looking there

00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:56,680
duration good are all right

00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:00,400
so why does this picture suck i took

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:08,950
this in my local grocery store i live in

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:10,780
florida okay by the way when i took this

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:12,310
picture the guy working in produce got

00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,280
very nervous because I'm standing there

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,720
with my camera phone and the guys like

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,540
why was this guy taking a picture of my

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:22,750
department and came over to intercept me

00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:25,510
but so first lesson is don't suck if

00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:27,460
your project sucks you know it's good to

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:28,750
have a marketing team that works with

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,000
people and everything but the first

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:35,830
thing to do is make your project not

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,140
sunk okay second thing is planning have

00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:43,090
realistic goals and have a way to

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:45,880
measure your progress okay for example

00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:47,710
right now I can tell you we have about

00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,080
twenty eight thousand members to our

00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:53,770
forums this year or last year this time

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,420
we had zero big goose egg so we have

00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:59,200
measured that throughout the year to see

00:08:55,420 --> 00:09:00,880
how those forums have grown okay we have

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,300
in our build service how many people are

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,070
familiar with the opensuse build service

00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,680
all right this time next year I want all

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:10,720
the hands to go up the opensuse build

00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:12,820
service and I'm a distance five seconds

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,340
of actual advertising here opensuse

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:17,470
build service is a free software project

00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,780
that is not specific to open soon so we

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,330
use it to build our distribution but

00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:25,660
it's also available to build packages

00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:28,210
for fedora for Debian for cintas for red

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:30,190
hat enterprise linux or a bum to and

00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:32,890
from andreeva and four different

00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:36,390
versions of those districts it can be

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:38,770
used to develop software so for example

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,750
everybody knows the next Firefox is

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,460
right around the corner right how many

00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:45,550
people want to upgrade to run the next

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:47,410
Firefox now I mean upgrade your entire

00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:50,800
distro

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:52,269
right so you can actually go to the

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,800
build service and if somebody has

00:09:52,269 --> 00:09:55,750
packaged and put it there you can

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,190
actually build Firefox for an older

00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,740
system and get it out of our Meltzer's

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:02,199
this is how I can run the latest genome

00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:06,790
and KDE on an older install a little

00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:08,110
consume so for example so that's part of

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:09,670
the build service it's also free

00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,689
software anybody can download it and

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,550
install it mobilen has been using it

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:18,040
nice cooperation their story their sort

00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,810
of mobile and now bases itself on fedora

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,259
packages and they use our build service

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,959
to build mobile so anyway that's our

00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,730
built service going back to this my

00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,500
point of mentioning the number of users

00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:31,389
we have in the number of packages and

00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:34,480
our build servers which is by the way

00:10:31,389 --> 00:10:36,699
more than 68,000 reason I mentioned that

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,470
is because I track this this is one of

00:10:36,699 --> 00:10:40,300
my metrics for success is that that

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:44,500
number is always increasing in a steady

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,199
clip if it's not there's a problem so we

00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,220
have tools and be measured them and

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:51,699
we're trying to find more ways to

00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,519
measure unfortunately opensuse the

00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:56,529
history of Susa was it was a distro that

00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,120
used open source software but was sort

00:10:56,529 --> 00:11:00,850
of built in a proprietary way we're

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,500
changing that but that means that a lot

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,569
of our processes and tools need to be

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,740
revamped it also means we don't have a

00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:08,500
good way of distinguishing between

00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,029
internal and external contributors so we

00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,529
need ways to count you know like who

00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:13,600
built a package because right now we

00:11:11,529 --> 00:11:16,180
don't have the tools to do that we have

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,420
instead of going to the powers-that-be

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,519
or the other project planners and saying

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,339
you know we have X number of internal

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,959
and external people developing we just

00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,819
have sort of anecdotal evidence well I

00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:30,579
know this guy who does 20 packages and

00:11:27,819 --> 00:11:32,470
he doesn't work for novell um so we need

00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:33,939
to measure that better but anyway the

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,550
point is you need to be able to measure

00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:38,529
project's progress by the way feel free

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:41,259
to jump in with questions if you have

00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,910
them during the talk I'm happy to make

00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:46,689
this more interactive that's why I'm

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,730
throwing things at people and to keep

00:11:46,689 --> 00:11:53,079
you awake they told me throwing coffee

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:56,910
would be a bad thing so the next stage

00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:59,170
is communication communication in a

00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,010
office how many folks work in an office

00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,800
with their pile

00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:05,230
tix and things like that okay how many

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:09,420
of you think communication is hard just

00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:12,040
with people your local too okay imagine

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:14,950
the fun you get when you're with a

00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:18,340
project that has several development

00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:20,380
offices and distinct cultures we have a

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,270
large contingent of folks from Germany

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,620
who are known for their warmth and

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,960
politeness we have a large number of

00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,670
people in the US we have some folks who

00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,580
participate from Latin America or

00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:36,820
becoming more prevalent we have some

00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:38,470
folks from Japan I by the way visited

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,970
many of these people and I found that

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:41,620
there are some very interesting and

00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:45,790
spectacular language and cultural

00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:47,170
barriers and then there's the tools how

00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,000
many of you have gotten into an argument

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:50,950
over emailed and found out that it was

00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,600
just a misunderstanding because people

00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:56,170
aren't good at communicating via text

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,340
instead of speech okay so there is a lot

00:12:56,170 --> 00:13:01,720
of work to do when it comes to

00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:03,280
communication think about when you start

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,690
if you have the luxury by the way of

00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:07,750
planning out a project from scratch

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,060
instead of it a drawing organically fake

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:12,670
very seriously about communication and

00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,970
where you have discussions about certain

00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:18,270
things IRC for example great to just

00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:21,580
jump in and talk to people real quick

00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:23,170
lousy medium for propagation of

00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,670
knowledge because what you get is well

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,050
this guy was logged in at this time and

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,520
this guy was logged in at this time and

00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:30,040
something that important discussion

00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:32,050
happened here but only these five people

00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:35,140
participated because it was 3am on the

00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:38,110
west coast kind of thing fake very

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,910
carefully about how you structure your

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,940
conversations in your communication

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:45,760
email is a lousy medium to decide

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,220
anything complicated

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,870
so think about forums think about more

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,580
collaboration tools the open source

00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,130
community by the way needs more

00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,980
collaboration tools better collaboration

00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,810
tools one of the things we're working on

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,100
for example that's a good collaboration

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,830
tool we're trying to make a good

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:04,930
collaboration tool is complain for

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:08,860
example and so I'd invite people to

00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:11,940
check that out you like how I just slip

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,300
in just little you know plugs for them

00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:21,250
kept link I can spell that thank you

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:23,470
it's a ka b li in cake so solid project

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,140
infrastructure this is really important

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:28,950
and this is one of my pain points

00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:32,470
opensuse quite frankly our

00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:35,680
infrastructure could be best described

00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,240
as whimsical at times it's definitely

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,740
something we've been working on over

00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,140
last year's but they're a couple of

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:43,000
points of infrastructure one point is

00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:46,060
just the servers that thing's reside on

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,280
whether or not things stay up the other

00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,930
part of infrastructure is that again

00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,490
going back to the build service that

00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,900
we've been working on whether or not

00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:55,210
your tools allow you to do the things

00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,490
that you need to do when the project

00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,500
started we did not have a good way to

00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,780
allow people to contribute to the

00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,430
project because people who didn't work

00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,890
for novell and who work behind the

00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:07,810
firewall they had to go through a

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:09,520
gatekeeper to submit changes and they

00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,140
had to go through gatekeepers to submit

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,540
things that we had two obstacles that

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:16,240
are the first one was the tools the

00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,920
second one was our policies we got rid

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,870
of the first one about nine months ago

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,210
and we got rid of the second one a

00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:24,130
couple of weeks ago we now have a policy

00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,290
where we are creating Cortines where

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,640
anybody can contribute if we have a

00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:30,130
pilot and we have tools that allow

00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:34,300
anyone to contribute the tools no longer

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:36,100
reside behind a firewall okay so think

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:38,650
about when your project is getting

00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:41,470
started whether or not anybody who could

00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:43,150
contribute can contribute easily because

00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,280
you want to remove those speed bumps to

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,680
contributions and you definitely want to

00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,570
remove speed bumps to use if people

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,860
can't get and use your software easily

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,750
they're not going to it we'll talk about

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:59,610
that a little bit so this is another one

00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,610
of my philosophies people may disagree

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:05,890
my philosophy in a lot of places if

00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,450
you're coming at it from leading a

00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,420
project if you're coming at it from a

00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:11,860
company sponsoring the project lead and

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,610
then get the hell out of the way and let

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,530
other people do it because if you are

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:21,400
one of say ten people employed the work

00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:23,650
on a project there's no way in hell you

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:27,400
have the bandwidth to scale to a

00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:29,350
thriving project and what needs to

00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,210
happen generally speaking is put out an

00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,610
idea and let the community run with it

00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:35,470
and one of two things will happen if

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,990
it's something the community cares about

00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:40,870
and wants to see happen they will run

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,520
with it and it will happen period in a

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:44,110
story the open source community has

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:47,230
proven this time and time again people

00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,480
care things work when people don't care

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:52,210
things fall apart but when not enough

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,000
people care things fall apart and if you

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,230
care about it as a company either you

00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,940
need to look at those things and you

00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,350
either need to fund them completely or

00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,670
you need to let it die if there's

00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:04,620
something the community doesn't care

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:07,510
about one example and I hate to pick on

00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:10,750
the red hat fedora folks but i'll pick

00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,790
on them if you look at the fedora legacy

00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:14,439
project that was something that didn't

00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:18,070
succeed over time because not enough

00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,540
people wanted to get into it enough

00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:21,730
people cared about it to start the

00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:24,730
project to begin to get it going but not

00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:27,760
enough to sustain it and this obviously

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,950
wasn't something that the corporate

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,470
parent wanted to sustain again that's

00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:37,020
not a knock that you guys just has a

00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:40,000
good example if you look at for example

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,250
Mozilla sweet not firefox with the

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,410
Mozilla sweet there's still enough

00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:46,030
dedicated volunteers at least the last

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:49,600
time I checked to keep putting that out

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,920
on a regular basis so there are things

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,290
that people care about things that they

00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,030
don't we just started finally an

00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:00,010
ambassador project thank you for the

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:02,200
name and basically my philosophy was

00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,029
that you know we the first week or so of

00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,690
that I kind of lobbed it over the wall

00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:09,219
once we got it ready and a lot of people

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:10,989
were like wait this isn't completely

00:18:09,219 --> 00:18:13,029
defined we don't have everything here

00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,139
and I'm like that was the point because

00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,299
the people are going to be doing the

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:18,639
work are not neat and you need to define

00:18:16,299 --> 00:18:20,440
it you need a run with it because if if

00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,359
I tell you how to do everything and

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,820
there's no creative thinking and go by

00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:26,859
in on on anybody's park it's not going

00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,359
to succeed because they're not and

00:18:26,859 --> 00:18:30,399
they're not an army of people out there

00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:32,109
to get up in the morning and say I want

00:18:30,399 --> 00:18:34,090
to take my direction from some guy in

00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:36,089
Florida you know they want to do what

00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:41,249
they need to do to make things succeed

00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:44,049
so I think I've eaten that horse enough

00:18:41,249 --> 00:18:45,849
distribution this is one of my long-term

00:18:44,049 --> 00:18:48,700
that paves about some open source

00:18:45,849 --> 00:18:51,849
projects how many people have ever said

00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,320
you know hey I need to fix this problem

00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:57,999
or I want the latest release into the

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:59,469
answer is great get it out of SDN there

00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:01,029
are a lot of that that's a problem

00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:02,499
because how many users is going to take

00:19:01,029 --> 00:19:04,089
the time to get to know sdn and do a

00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:07,269
check out just to get the latest release

00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:10,029
of something this is one of the things

00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:12,369
that our build service is designed to

00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:14,529
solve and this is also a thing that a

00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:16,570
lot of a lot of open source projects

00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:18,129
were getting better about but you know

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:19,989
if you look at a bun to for example they

00:19:18,129 --> 00:19:22,629
did a great job when that project launch

00:19:19,989 --> 00:19:24,549
of distributing to bunt to everybody who

00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:28,430
wanted I mean I think they were just be

00:19:24,549 --> 00:19:31,290
need a 0 l in terms of shipping discount

00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:35,280
so the budget for that most featured

00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:37,050
ninjas but it worked right you know I

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,790
wonder where a buncha would be today if

00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,890
they had been stingy with the discs

00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:43,520
because a lot of people i think started

00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,140
with it because they shipped up just

00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,940
distribution is very important making it

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,760
easy for your target audience to get

00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:53,820
software and a format that they want is

00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,890
very important so that's one of the

00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,470
things that we focus on three build

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,960
service through our DVDs and so forth

00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:04,020
you know we've got tons maybe needs out

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,120
at the desk and when you try to make

00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,410
live CDs available on the site so the

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,740
people who don't want to download an

00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:13,490
entire DVD can get that if you aren't a

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,840
project that's complicated to install

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,030
think about making a vmware image

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,100
available or ZeniMax or something like

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:22,610
that so that people don't have to go

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:25,980
through the entire install just a try

00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:28,260
there's a project the name is escaping

00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:32,490
me a bit rock the bit nami stuff how

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:34,380
many people heard of this oh man this is

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,990
a great project that have no affiliation

00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:39,360
with bitten ami is what they do is they

00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:41,160
create a software stack that all you

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,720
have to do is grab the bit Nami stack

00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,450
and you're running something like

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,000
wordpress or track or something like

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,470
that in like five minutes you don't have

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
to have been patched the patch here my

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,190
sequel installed on your system before

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,680
you just go get the bit Nami stack

00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:58,200
download and try it it's like crack so

00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,490
if there's if there's some server based

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,770
software you've been thinking about

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,390
trying out go look at the Nami because

00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:07,860
they usually have a staff available for

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:11,160
the most popular stuff so that's another

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:13,540
way to get things going

00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,280
another thing that every good project

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:17,440
needs to get the word out in to reach as

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,680
many people as possible is evangelists I

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,170
used to kind of shy away from this word

00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:25,480
because if you pay attention to the way

00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:27,010
that the IT press and other people have

00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,280
talked and written about open source

00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:32,050
over the years evangelist is kind of a

00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,240
negative connotation because it has a

00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:36,040
religious connotation and people have

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,900
beaten free software advocates over the

00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:40,690
head with the religious label for years

00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:42,520
and I've always hated it but you do need

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,910
people who go out and evangelize your

00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,680
project project you need people and to

00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,380
get people to go out and do this they

00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,690
have to be happy about your project they

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,940
have to be enjoying working with your

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:58,000
community okay we have some great

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,770
evangelists in our community you know we

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,110
have some folks who for example work

00:21:59,770 --> 00:22:04,240
with the opensuse education project who

00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:06,670
go out and they take opensuse to schools

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:09,280
and they help evangelize open source

00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:14,020
software to people who aren't already

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:16,420
involved with overseers this picture by

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,270
the way the reason I took this the guy

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:21,850
at the far end is his name is set torah

00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,950
and i met him in tokyo he's one of our

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,880
evangelists he's one of our enthusiasts

00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:29,410
in tokyo and he's been doing great work

00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,530
and he's a lot of people i think about

00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:36,280
what i think about evangelists any

00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:38,700
questions or comments so far is their

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:42,460
own still with me oh wait

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,860
wire forms better than email generally

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,930
speaking I think that people there are a

00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,840
couple of steps involved with with going

00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:52,450
to a forum and posting email as part of

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:54,700
people's normal workflow and so they get

00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,170
something in their inbox data then

00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:58,570
respond off of the top of their heads

00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:00,460
and it's gone there's also the fact that

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,860
a forum thread is a little bit easier to

00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,570
follow and wait in the middle you don't

00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,280
have to take you don't have to subscribe

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:08,710
to a mailing list and deal with all the

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:11,260
spam or not to spam but these with the

00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:12,790
noise signal to noise problem you can go

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,520
and search out something in a forum that

00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:17,230
you want to participate in so there are

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,500
a couple of reasons it's a slightly

00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:22,300
higher bar of participation is on right

00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,040
and that's good because when you're

00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:26,280
having a conversation an email about a

00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,410
policy or something you want the more

00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,990
interested people who are more motivated

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:34,480
to participate in the conversation

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,100
rather than those who just rip off their

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,430
opinion that probably aren't going to

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,230
follow through a lot of things that's my

00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:49,630
thought you look skeptical that that's

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:51,310
all three okay yeah I mean that's a nice

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,470
thing about email but then again there's

00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:59,730
also kind of some downsides to email so

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:01,470
any other questions all right

00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:04,320
I think it's time to throw something

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:11,940
else yeah I'll try for the back of the

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:14,420
room all right gaps first room so the

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:18,090
next step if you're actually trying to

00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,770
get your word out about your project you

00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,810
may be stunned to learn that as a former

00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,540
journalist I would actually suggest if

00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:27,530
you learn to work with the media and let

00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,850
me give you some of the background there

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:32,310
this has been a bad year by the way for

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:36,480
the media I'm on a mailing list of other

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:39,980
professional journalists and I remember

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,030
one day in March I think it was you know

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,710
people on the list talk about what

00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:45,900
happens to them professionally and ever

00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:47,280
even once or twice a month for last

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,160
couple of years you can see somebody

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:53,070
come on I am looking for work I just got

00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,720
laid off for that shuttered my magazine

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:56,700
or whatever we had a day in March with

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,860
like three people the same day not laid

00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:00,630
off from different publications it's

00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,380
been bloodbath over the last year the

00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:06,150
ITRs the one of the effects of this is

00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:08,340
the people who are still working in the

00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:10,830
press are scrambling and they are

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,600
usually overworked if you show up in

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,370
front of them with information that they

00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,830
can write a story quickly and satisfy a

00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:18,710
deadline they love you and you're

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,260
probably going to get very good coverage

00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:24,690
a couple of things about working with

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:26,370
the press I've noticed that free

00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,950
software advocates have a tendency to

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:30,960
sleep first and ask questions later when

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:32,310
they see a story if you're in the press

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,650
that doesn't meet their lighting they

00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:37,170
tend to let's say respond lyst

00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:40,980
diplomatically than they could that's a

00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:45,900
bad idea journalists are supposed to be

00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:47,970
neutral but they're humans okay and if

00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,980
you have 15 people from a project

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,070
flaming a guy because he got a fact

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:54,750
wrong and I'm the odds are the next time

00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,070
he writes about the project if he

00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:59,310
chooses to write about that project

00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,960
again or she do you think they're going

00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,200
to have a wonderful mental image of your

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,480
project

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,370
when they get power out to it again or

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,170
maybe they'll think the next time around

00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,470
you know the last time I wrote about

00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:13,810
Project X they were really quickly about

00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:16,780
it and they corrected every little thing

00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:18,910
you know or whatever maybe they'll just

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:21,430
choose to avoid that pain in the future

00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:24,370
so when you deal with other people

00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:26,080
professionally especially journalists I

00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:44,620
would advise doing it carefully and

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:46,300
diplomatic you need to so if you want

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,220
them to actually write about say i'm

00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:51,160
assuming i'm going to assume you're

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:52,990
coming from the ohio linux best angle if

00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,700
you want to get somebody from the

00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,620
general media interest and you have to

00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,680
have a local look you have to have given

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:01,960
reason and again kind of hand it to them

00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:03,220
on the platter especially because then

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:07,060
you're dealing with somebody who just

00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:10,720
does not know your project at all so you

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:11,740
really need to you know sell it to them

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,930
in a way that they're going to

00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,690
understand and see why their viewers or

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:19,870
their readers would care that would be

00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:21,730
my you know my suggestion and I would

00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,970
also start approaching them very girly

00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:26,470
don't don't go to local press two days

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,670
before your event and say hey we're

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,410
doing this thing in two days can you do

00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,910
a story about it because they may have

00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:34,600
their stories planned out a week or two

00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:36,130
in advance so start talking to them you

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:38,440
know for a while when X best are talking

00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:42,310
to people in August and that's what a

00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,780
thing hey other questions the other

00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,970
thing I would say about working with the

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,130
media is have really good release notes

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,650
for your project have screenshots have

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:54,070
everything that a journalist would want

00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:55,299
on hand right away there are a lot of

00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,279
bloggers and people

00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:59,980
right now who again are just trying to

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:01,539
hit massive ridiculous deadlines they're

00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,610
not going to take the time to do a

00:28:01,539 --> 00:28:05,289
screenshot tour of their own they're

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:07,330
going to reproduce screenshots so have

00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:10,419
some ready have somebody who is

00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,860
available pretty much on less than 24

00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:15,159
hours notice to respond to press

00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:17,440
inquiries if somebody from Linux weekly

00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:20,200
news emails you on Monday their deadline

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,239
is on Wednesday so if the email you

00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,159
Monday requesting comments for a story

00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:27,399
then you need to be able to reply my

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,809
tuesday or he may miss the book okay it

00:28:27,399 --> 00:28:36,730
just depends on the publication also how

00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:38,200
many of you like money there are people

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,899
who are not raising their hands i'm not

00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:46,179
feeling full honesty here so if you like

00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:48,629
money and you like your project i have a

00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:51,909
way you can combine those two things um

00:28:48,629 --> 00:28:53,499
a lot of the IT press again is sort of

00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:55,210
there's a lot of freelancers and

00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:58,419
strangers and a lot of publications

00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,970
depend upon freelancers to contribute a

00:28:58,419 --> 00:29:03,970
large amount of content as somebody who

00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:05,919
edited a magazine and website for some

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,899
time I can tell you that it is much

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,759
harder than you would think to get

00:29:07,899 --> 00:29:11,970
people to respond to waiting a check

00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:15,119
around to show off with a

00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:18,129
well-researched decent piece on software

00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,269
you will not get rich doing this but if

00:29:18,129 --> 00:29:22,179
you want to make a couple hundred bucks

00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:24,279
fairly quickly often you can do so by

00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:27,429
approaching the right technology

00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:28,840
publication in saying hi I participate

00:29:27,429 --> 00:29:31,389
in this project and would like to give

00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,830
you an in-depth tutorial on this or I'd

00:29:31,389 --> 00:29:34,210
like to do this and this will do two

00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:36,940
things that will put a little cash in

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:40,899
your pocket and it will get the word out

00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:44,499
about your project okay and also third

00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:46,059
bonus it never hurts on your resume and

00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:47,380
how many people are thinking about their

00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:49,460
resumes these days

00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,960
never hurts that you resume to have a

00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,760
little line as a line item of

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,890
publications okay because we all know

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,540
that import employers prefer people who

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:03,320
are good at written communications and

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:05,690
who are who have a name so think about

00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,070
that next time your thing about how do I

00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,930
get somebody to write about my project

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,670
don't wait for somebody to write about

00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:15,400
your project go to a publication and say

00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:15,400
I'll do it just you know work with me

00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,790
the next alternative is to actually

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,660
become the media this is something that

00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:27,050
different parts of the open source

00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,240
community have done great job in how

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:32,030
many people read planets on regular

00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:37,010
basis like planet ubuntu plant fedora

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:38,630
opensuse vs jeff wad another fellow

00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,940
whose name escapes me came up with

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:44,450
software called planet but aggregates

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,160
blogs okay and so you can install this

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:47,690
and your project and have a planet where

00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,030
people can come and have a one-stop shop

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:54,530
to read all the blogs related to your

00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:56,840
project these are pretty handy it

00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:58,580
doesn't take that long to block people

00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,040
tend to get freaked out i think by the

00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:02,660
blank page start a blog if you're not

00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,940
blogging already if you contribute to a

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:06,800
project it does not have to be

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,010
complicated if you've read michael meeks

00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,570
as blog for example you know he puts up

00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:15,020
there every day i poked it you know i

00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:17,180
poked it male i worked on this bug i did

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,800
this but the important thing is it gets

00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:21,740
the information out there so people who

00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:24,530
are interested in go ho nobody's working

00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,200
on they know to approach him about

00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,000
certain topics they know not by

00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,610
inference they know not to approach him

00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,320
about other topics and they also know

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:35,030
what he's thinking about where he's

00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:37,049
going with the project it's much better

00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:41,369
than just tossing code over the wall

00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:44,249
six months so that is a good thing it

00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:46,559
does not have to be you know anyway you

00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:49,399
can just a couple of paragraphs everyone

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:51,869
salon what you're working on this great

00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:53,639
podcasting I don't personally listen the

00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:56,580
podcast but that's a good way to

00:31:53,639 --> 00:31:59,009
communicate with a large segment of the

00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:04,830
audience how many people actually listen

00:31:59,009 --> 00:32:07,289
to podcast oh my god okay I just I can't

00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:10,409
work two people talking so I I tend to

00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:12,450
do I tend to do all my work to music so

00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:15,210
the podcasts are a good weird i don't

00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:17,399
have a commutative work from home so you

00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:19,289
know I get a bit I take a shower I go

00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:23,519
downstairs and work not really a lot of

00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:26,100
opportunity for podcasts there any

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,929
questions about this back in the back I

00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:34,470
don't know he was waiting at someone

00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:36,330
else no all right finally one thing I

00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:39,690
want to talk about is collaborate with

00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:41,340
other projects we visited it's you know

00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:42,989
this was one of my goals when i started

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,700
with novell last year and had some

00:32:42,989 --> 00:32:48,679
success but a lot less it would like

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:51,210
because of various reasons it's it's um

00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,220
it's less trivial than I'd hope to

00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,710
actually collaborate communicate with

00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,629
other projects and pull things off but

00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,730
an open source it is important to think

00:32:57,629 --> 00:33:03,419
about look around before you reinvent

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:05,039
the wheel make it try to break out

00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:07,739
infrastructure that other people might

00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,440
want and you know go out and look for

00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:13,499
other areas to increase other ways to

00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,330
increase your surface area I think it's

00:33:13,499 --> 00:33:18,330
really important for projects especially

00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,549
linux distributions at this stage to not

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:23,279
keep reinventing the wheel you know if

00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:26,549
something isn't vitally competitive

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,779
important share it with other projects

00:33:26,549 --> 00:33:29,830
because you don't have to carry the

00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:32,450
maintenance burden

00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,269
by the way this picture this minus

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:38,090
represents collaboration this was from

00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:39,889
the google mentor summit last year and

00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,899
that was a great opportunity for anybody

00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:44,539
participating in google Summer of Code

00:33:41,899 --> 00:33:46,480
if you have the opportunity to attend

00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:48,799
this event I strongly working in it

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,980
because it is a really good chance to

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,529
talk to a lot of different projects so

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:56,419
over last year for example opensuse has

00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:58,490
started taking some things from other

00:33:56,419 --> 00:34:01,730
distros like for example we've taken

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:04,639
smoke we're using that a little bit I

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,990
know other distros look at it pesto for

00:34:04,639 --> 00:34:09,010
example or using some of our

00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:11,599
infrastructure in the form of Delta rpms

00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:13,159
and so those are some great examples of

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,240
things flourishing outside of the

00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:22,159
respective projects so any questions on

00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:25,490
me finally this is my philosophy do

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,679
something even if it's wrong I have

00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:30,349
watched way too many projects deliberate

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,419
and discuss and hem and haw and talk

00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:35,540
about things for months and months and

00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:37,760
months that takes longer to do something

00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,520
and make a decision that it would to do

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,369
it find out it was a mistake undo it and

00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:45,109
do the right thing okay don't spend all

00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:48,560
of your time worrying about not making

00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:51,050
mistakes making mistakes is just it's

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,869
going to happen make them quickly and

00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:56,060
get them out of the game okay learn to

00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:57,920
say we screwed up and not feel

00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,470
embarrassed about it if you're doing

00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,050
good work and you do something and it

00:35:00,470 --> 00:35:05,240
turns out we made a boo-boo that's okay

00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:08,089
that's why you release early and often

00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:09,680
okay we think about it that way with

00:35:08,089 --> 00:35:11,480
code but not always that way with

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,359
projects and not always that way with

00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,300
with other activities so if you take

00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:19,250
anything away from this thing I would

00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,680
say that that's the most important point

00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:23,060
pull the trigger when you get to a

00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,710
certain point don't discuss things

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,710
together so

00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,290
that's all I've got for this particular

00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:34,840
top

00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:38,620
if anybody has questions or comments now

00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:40,060
would be the time I still have a couple

00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:55,810
of geek O's so people with good

00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:57,730
questions may be rewarded yes all

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,100
conversations can jump into the middle

00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:02,620
to track of everything that's going on

00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:04,690
the akhoonds new wave product is

00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:07,060
designed to address some of those things

00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,570
you see that take an active role and

00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:15,730
please offer to help I could give you a

00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:18,460
firm maybe so I haven't dove into it too

00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:22,480
deeply from what I looked at it it looks

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:24,610
immensely sexy and it depends on how

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,400
much of it is open and how good the free

00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:30,610
software and Linux tools are I certainly

00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:32,410
like what I have seen so far I think

00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,420
they have some great ideas and I'm glad

00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:38,980
that somebody is willing to blow up the

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:41,050
normal email thought process so one way

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,580
or another I think it'll play some role

00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:44,800
but how much and whether it's google

00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:46,390
wave or something else they've got

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,750
people thinking about alternative ways

00:36:46,390 --> 00:36:52,150
of doing that I've been doing email now

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:53,950
for 15 or 16 years and i've never used

00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,110
an email client that doesn't suck it's

00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:05,100
just how much so I'd like to see

00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:05,100
something new so thank you yes sir

00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:18,380
I'm sorry about that there was a mistake

00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,380
actually did talk a little bit about it

00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:40,230
okay I'm not going there I've got to

00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:43,380
drive through Georgia I've had a thought

00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:47,640
process has been ongoing for 10 12 years

00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,470
about breakings of mindsets there's all

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,589
sorts of things whether it's public

00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:58,800
education private education K through 12

00:37:52,589 --> 00:38:01,319
we're at university level just if you

00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,030
can in 30 minutes or less what what does

00:38:01,319 --> 00:38:14,660
nobody think what is open soon

00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:18,650
about specifically right there are as

00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:21,400
many of me as there are two say okay

00:38:18,650 --> 00:38:26,270
with whatever comes pre-installed change

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,700
right so quick thoughts on that I can't

00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:32,180
I don't speak for novell officially so

00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:33,770
will restrict my thoughts to opensuse I

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,680
think one of the most important

00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:38,990
sub-projects in our larger project is

00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:43,070
the education project for a couple of

00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:45,860
reasons people get started on you know

00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:48,290
learning the computer I hate to use this

00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,660
word but i'm going to paradigm early

00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,520
right and so if they get used to windows

00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:55,610
early they're going to kind of get used

00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:58,490
to windows long-term that's obviously

00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,800
not good for us there's also the fact

00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:02,330
that people tend to in my experience

00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,790
anecdotally I don't think there's good

00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:07,070
research on this people tend to attach

00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:10,130
to open source projects in late high

00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,050
school early University and so if we

00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:14,720
want to reach contributors the time to

00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:16,250
do it is in those in those years so I

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,100
think it's really vitally important to

00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:21,700
get into education and it's an area that

00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,230
we need to focus on we have two problems

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:27,340
major problems in that area number one

00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,260
is inertia there is not a lot of

00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:32,870
incentive for a lot of educational

00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:36,230
institutions to change right because

00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:38,270
people in my experience in IT and

00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:41,720
education are not measured by results

00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:43,280
quite the same way and maybe content

00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,630
they may not in fact in a lot of times

00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,200
in smaller districts that may not be

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:51,560
their only job so strategizing about a

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:53,840
new platform is not their first goal the

00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,130
other problem we have there is frankly

00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,310
there's not a lot of money in education

00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:59,870
when you compare it to other industries

00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:01,520
if you have to look at Wall Street

00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:03,170
customers versus education which

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,500
vertical do you spend your money on as

00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:09,530
an open-source Dendur so that's another

00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:11,420
problem there this is one of the things

00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:13,200
we're open source enthusiasts are going

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,609
to have to apply a lot of love and

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,550
no grease if we're going to succeed so

00:40:16,609 --> 00:40:22,560
and you know over the next year I can't

00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:24,510
make any firm commitments but I can say

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,820
that education is featuring very large

00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:33,690
and my planning for opensuse on the

00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:55,530
marketing side Microsoft piece of my

00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:59,700
life I've never heard anyone say yep why

00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:04,170
can you this big scale of it tomorrow

00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:08,630
yeah but why not guarantee the both

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,630
people have a clue they were like oh

00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:28,150
so but thanks for the question anybody

00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:30,819
else yes sir earlier this week I need to

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,200
pick the latest version better than pay

00:41:30,819 --> 00:41:35,750
and the only way I can do that is

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,310
through this game pop so clearly there's

00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:44,420
some movement in the community away from

00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:46,849
this easy tarball package thing to you

00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:49,400
want my stuff here's how you get just

00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:53,690
cut and paste this line so I gotta

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,420
disagree with as the ends too hard all I

00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,859
have to do is kind of page I would

00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:01,569
suggest that you're probably a little

00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:01,569
more knowledgeable than the average user

00:42:05,109 --> 00:42:12,500
it it may not be too hard for you but

00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,560
for example let's take my girlfriend's

00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:16,579
kid who wants ffmpeg for something

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,790
they're going to get frustrated they're

00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,960
going to want to go use a Mac most users

00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:23,450
are going to get frustrated and they're

00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,810
going to say one of the mistakes that we

00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:29,300
make I think is that we as a community

00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:35,750
value free software and we value open

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:39,800
source for for reasons that are beyond

00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:41,660
the practical implications and there is

00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,839
a large philosophy philosophical

00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:46,339
component for us most consumers don't

00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:48,710
have that and we have to recognize that

00:42:46,339 --> 00:42:50,480
if it's too hard to use the software

00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:52,099
they won't they'll go back to the

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,829
proprietary software they're comfortable

00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:57,740
with so that's that's kind of where I'm

00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:59,960
coming from we you know I don't think

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:01,730
anything of getting into Espeon or or

00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,950
doing a command-line thing to get

00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,710
something I've done it for 10 years but

00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:08,420
when it comes down to you know the guy

00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,430
down the street who I gave the opensuse

00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,260
disk to who's tried it and liked it so

00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,030
far but then he decided he wants to do

00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,190
task X or Y and wants to get this

00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,869
software the only way to do it is out of

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:23,020
svn what he doesn't even know what

00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:23,020
source control is we have a problem so

00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:40,730
well yeah yeah you get heavily into yak

00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:42,950
shaping the first time you have to get

00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:45,620
source code to everybody familiar with

00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:49,760
the Akshay Vings good ok I love that

00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:55,180
term any other questions oh by the way

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:58,310
this guy has a brilliant name tag so

00:43:55,180 --> 00:44:02,770
it's an LED scrolling name tag it's

00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:02,770
brilliant yes sir

00:44:10,919 --> 00:44:19,269
with being plugged into this community

00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:24,939
and all that he not that was accompanied

00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:26,469
being plugged into that let's say we

00:44:24,939 --> 00:44:28,959
will take particular suite of software

00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:31,329
like a known Katie your letter we're

00:44:28,959 --> 00:44:33,999
going to the direction okay and and

00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:35,439
novel obviously doesn't write the

00:44:33,999 --> 00:44:38,289
software so they just kind of taken

00:44:35,439 --> 00:44:42,189
activated mystery I can deal with that

00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:44,499
from a you know we want to do this but

00:44:42,189 --> 00:44:46,900
pupils to that so we kind of have to do

00:44:44,499 --> 00:44:48,459
that by all so stupid and how do you

00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:52,269
deal with that from our perspective

00:44:48,459 --> 00:44:54,959
where customer comes in is ok we want to

00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:58,439
be able to do this is that Matt and

00:44:54,959 --> 00:45:00,790
maybe it's a request that doesn't really

00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:02,710
doesn't fall under what and you guys

00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:05,170
Rella right where they want to do some

00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:07,120
kind of you know major change that how

00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:12,180
can L works how can you order this

00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:12,180
record and its own custom

00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:23,259
so okay so the question I haven't been

00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:25,670
repeating the questions bad on me

00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:27,440
question is basically how do we how does

00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:29,059
novell deal with the fact that open

00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,459
source projects kind of go in their own

00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,989
direction whereas we may have customer

00:45:31,459 --> 00:45:35,509
requirements and I have 30 seconds I'm

00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:37,369
going to talk very quickly basically we

00:45:35,509 --> 00:45:39,440
go with the flow is the short answer we

00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:43,160
employ people to work on gum a lot of

00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:45,619
them or a fair number of them and we try

00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,719
to participate with the project in such

00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:50,029
a way that we can get things in when we

00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,499
think they're important but if the

00:45:50,029 --> 00:45:53,359
community does not go in the direction

00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:55,940
that we want to go that we have to cope

00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:57,739
and compensate for that and we have to

00:45:55,940 --> 00:45:59,779
go back to our customers and again I'm

00:45:57,739 --> 00:46:01,999
not going to the customers i'm going to

00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:04,309
the community but we would have to go to

00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:06,890
the customers and say this is open

00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:08,930
sources and this is the way it works in

00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,719
the past novell has developed some

00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:14,269
things outside of that chain and it's

00:46:11,719 --> 00:46:16,009
always kind of been it's it's not worked

00:46:14,269 --> 00:46:18,529
for the best if you look at the way comp

00:46:16,009 --> 00:46:20,150
is and some of those things work so

00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:22,969
we've learned that it's better to try to

00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:25,759
work within the community the better

00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:27,410
example that is on the kernel level and

00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:29,119
we do a lot of work in the kernel and a

00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:31,489
lot of other companies do the same thing

00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,199
to try to get the features and we want

00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:35,809
but we can't force it and it's a bad

00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:38,869
idea to ship a patch set that isn't in

00:46:35,809 --> 00:46:40,400
the colonel so and that's all the time

00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:44,390
that I've got thank you very much for

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,670
