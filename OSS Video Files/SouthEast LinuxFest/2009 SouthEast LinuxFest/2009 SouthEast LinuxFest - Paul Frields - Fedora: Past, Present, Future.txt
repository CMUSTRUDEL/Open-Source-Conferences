the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,359
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,740
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,049
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,310
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:20,070
southeast linux fest org um so my name

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,900
is Paul fields I'm the Fedora project

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,060
leader that basically means that i work

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:29,609
for red hat and i serve as the community

00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,130
go-between from our many many thousands

00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:33,899
of volunteers and our engineering

00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,820
department and other departments at Red

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,290
Hat and just making sure that we have

00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,750
everybody coordinated and working

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,340
towards towards really good goals for

00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,530
for open source to keep progressing

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,260
forward and it's something that i

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:48,239
started doing back in February of last

00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,719
year I took over from God by the name of

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,969
Max Spivak Max is now one of our one of

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,160
our community leaders and community on

00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,289
the Red Hat community architecture team

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,640
so I work very closely with him and his

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,789
team to make sure that we're doing

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,920
everything we can to empower our

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:06,810
community to do interesting and amazing

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,369
things with fedora and not just with the

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,080
door but with many of the other areas

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:12,390
that Red Hat touches because of course

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,460
Red Hat is very deeply involved in open

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,140
source beyond just Fedora we have a

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:18,350
number of other up streams that we work

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,299
in we're very excited about

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,220
opportunities in education in increasing

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,259
transparency in government and so on and

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,509
so forth so fedoras just one of the

00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,430
elements but luckily that's the part

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:31,740
that that I get to do so that's what I'm

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,079
going to talk to you about first you not

00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:37,079
to gild the lily but I did want to say a

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,390
very special thank you to the folks at

00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:40,979
Southeast linux fest for having me out

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,009
here giving me the opportunity to speak

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,110
and frankly putting on a hell of a

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:48,899
conference for the first time I was just

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,640
floored and really happy that I got to

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,979
be here for your not girl then so thank

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,979
you and also oh yeah

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,540
and thanks to the other speakers and

00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:06,630
definitely thanks to all of you for

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,610
being here also I want to give a quick

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,250
thanks to anybody out there who is

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:13,709

can get to it and use it if you like and

00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,140
i just wanted to give a some notice to

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,769
the people who provided some of the

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:31,560
graphics that are in maya my slides here

00:02:27,769 --> 00:02:33,170
so i'm going to make this short we're

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,489
going to talk about fedora in a nutshell

00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,560
fedora is the community project

00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:39,780
sponsored by Red Hat we are not a beta

00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,390
of red hat enterprise linux we are not a

00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,310
dumping ground for crazy software we are

00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,170
a community run project that turns out

00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,989
every six months one of the best damn

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,580
linux distributions out there and it's

00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:53,720
chock full of goodies and i hope that

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:57,000
everybody will give a try to fedora 11

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,590
leonidas which was just released and i

00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,269
really like running a lot of different

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:01,470
Linux's that are out there I've got VMs

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,150
of pretty much everything that's out

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:05,190
there and I encourage you to do the same

00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:09,480
thing it's a lot of fun to play around

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:12,390
with other distros we are a contributor

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,209
centric community and that means that

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,950
we've set our sights squarely on people

00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:21,989
who want to participate in open source

00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:24,000
we think it's wonderful that grandma

00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:26,010
Tilly is all over the world like to use

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,280
fedora I actually have a grandma Tilly

00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,220
myself who uses fedora my mom uses it my

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:36,090
wife uses it my two kids aged eight and

00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:40,200
five use it so I truly believe that open

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:41,880
source is ready for everyone to use but

00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,829
being contributor centric means that

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,109
those people are a byproduct of the work

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:48,390
that we do in empowering contributors

00:03:46,109 --> 00:03:50,730
they're a byproduct of doing good work

00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:54,269
in increasing participation in open

00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,030
source and that focus is what makes

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,030
fodor important not just for those users

00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:01,890
further down the line of fedora but also

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,420
for the users of the distributions that

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,430
are derived from fedora and that

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,099
includes red hat enterprise linux and

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,460
that includes other distributions like

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:12,220
sent OS is anybody

00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:14,800
you're a Santa Wes user a lot of

00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:16,720
hands-on I am too actually I run at home

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,430
for my own server so you know those

00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,920
distributions also benefit from the work

00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:24,370
we do and that literally is tens of

00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,840
millions of users out there so what I'm

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,180
going to talk to you about is what

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,510
contributor centric means of why we

00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:33,460
concentrate on contributors how to do it

00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:36,600
I'll give you some of our experiences

00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:40,630
and empowering contributors and what

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:42,670
influences that produces for our project

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,240
and what's come out of that contributor

00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:50,170
focus can everybody hear me okay in the

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:52,000
back okay cool all right so I've gone

00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,890
backwards apparently in time and we're

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,540
going to start over again now all right

00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,820
don't hit that key that's what that

00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:05,470
means I'm lucky they give me a laptop

00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:08,320
actually oh god not that guy um so why

00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:10,150
focus on contributors well I guess

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,810
there's this is uh this is the way I

00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:15,190
like to lead into this question is is a

00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,950
question about the deep sea is anybody

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,950
here scuba dive some scuba divers out

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,570
here so you guys are probably know very

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,770
well and the rest of you probably do

00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,090
from watching things like you know the

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,760
discovery channel or something like that

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,430
that what is on top of the water is

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,020
broad and has many waves but what is

00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,070
much more interesting far more

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,230
interesting than what's on the surface

00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,120
the water is what's underneath right

00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:39,460
teeming with life it's teeming with

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,410
interesting stuff to get involved in and

00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,390
you know if you're if you're a diver you

00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,580
can go down and see some of this some of

00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:48,190
the life and and interesting ecosystems

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,440
that happen and and sort of put yourself

00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:52,930
right in the middle of them and I like

00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,750
to think about that as being a good

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,300
rough analogy for how communities of

00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:59,620
participation work all right this

00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,820
picture might be a little hard to read

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:02,170
for those of you in the back but

00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:04,330
essentially it's a triangle and the

00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,150
really wide base at the bottom is

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,620
consumers right and they could be

00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,940
consumers of any type right they could

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,280
be this could be a picture of all the

00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,960
people who like using high pods or you

00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,540
know all the people who drive on you

00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,810
know drive

00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,540
truck it really doesn't matter the

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,510
important thing is that the largest area

00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:26,720
of this of this triangle are essentially

00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:29,150
consumers right they'll use whatever it

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,010
is but essentially don't have a whole

00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,360
lot of investment in other than that and

00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:34,430
you know it's obviously they're very

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,950
important to keeping the vehicle system

00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:39,910
going but as you move up the triangle

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:42,980
what you find is that you start

00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,480
increasing the level of participation as

00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:49,670
you move to a narrower and narrower

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:50,870
focus of people and vice versa so what

00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:53,180
we've discovered by reverse engineering

00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,980
the numbers for the communities that we

00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,700
work in is that roughly eighty percent

00:06:54,980 --> 00:07:02,090
of any given community are content to

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,890
simply consume software which you know

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,170
again not a value judgment that's it's

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:07,370
absolutely required that you have those

00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,380
people because they're out there

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:12,050
actually running things and creating

00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:15,980
real world' real world' cases for you

00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:19,010
two for you to solve and out of the

00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:21,380
remaining twenty percent the majority do

00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:23,960
the majority actually will get involved

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,710
in a participatory way i'll talk about

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,000
some of those later as some of the some

00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:32,540
of the ways you might get involved in

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,840
participation would be moving from the

00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,760
shallow water the the surface down to

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,880
down to the shallow deeds where you

00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:43,640
start editing a wiki or filing a bug

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,030
right the minute somebody makes the leap

00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,800
from being just a consumer to where they

00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,630
actually get involved to make something

00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,220
better even just a small step like that

00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,540
it might be filing a bug it might be

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,360
giving somebody help on a mailing list

00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:59,210
they've crossed the line from being a

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,430
consumer to being a participant right

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:05,000
and that is where somebody becomes very

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:08,600
interesting to us as you know as an open

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,940
source project now as you further refine

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,370
that population and people move from

00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:20,000
things like editing the wiki and filing

00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:22,580
bugs to creating patches right or they

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,740
might actually triage bugs right or they

00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,390
might actually manage a team where they

00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:31,110
might write a piece of documentation

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,760
that's for formal publication and as you

00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:34,650
move further up that scale you find

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,660
people who actually get involved in in

00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,580
the code they actually become involved

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:40,200
as a package maintainer they might

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,310
actually maintain a software package in

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:46,230
in fedora and those are our contributors

00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:48,840
that's our core of contributors and that

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:52,500
comes to usually about five percent of

00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:55,170
that triangle well so why concentrate

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,170
just on that five percent well if you

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:00,660
look at just this triangle on so what

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:03,270
will happen is the the folks at the top

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:05,790
actually become the biggest influence on

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,920
everyone else around them right you can

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,600
think of these peoples like a

00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,670
fashionista right do any any of you have

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,830
fashionista friends people who you know

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,810
they're very trendy they have they you

00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:19,170
know know things about clothes and they

00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:20,970
know things about good music stuff like

00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:22,320
that right and you find out all your

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,090
good hints from them you find out hey

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,100
that band that you love you found out

00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,540
from a friend or you know when you keep

00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,880
coming back to that same friend again

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,100
and again you know those people are sort

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,260
of the movers and shakers of communities

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:39,230
those are people who get really deeply

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,700
involved in in a in some slice of life

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,560
so if you just look at this triangle by

00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,030
itself it seems like wow well really you

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,440
want to look at the consumers because I

00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,690
mean that is eighty percent of the

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,450
triangle unfortunately that eighty

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,730
percent doesn't have much influence over

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,860
people who are not already in that

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,090
community the people who really have the

00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,760
influence are the people who are

00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,310
contributors and participants right so

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,990
those are the people that we are really

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,970
interested in because they are the ones

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:10,560
who are going to influence this future

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:13,140
user pool which is many many many orders

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:19,020
of magnitude larger than the community

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:21,540
as it exists right now so in order to to

00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:24,060
go after these folks and you know get

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:25,950
them interested in fedora we we are

00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:28,080
interested in upstream communities and

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:31,110
ecologically sound practices what does

00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,890
that mean it essentially means that when

00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:39,120
we participate in an upstream we are

00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:40,660
looking to give back in a way that is

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,680
going to scale out to the entire

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,540
open source community when we are

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,089
maintaining packages and we find bugs

00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,670
that need fixing those patches actually

00:10:49,089 --> 00:10:53,500
go back up to the upstream community and

00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:55,180
we coordinate with them very closely and

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,709
we do that for a number of reasons one

00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,230
of them is because if you maintain

00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:00,639
patches essentially you are increasing

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:03,910
the load on the people who maintain

00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,339
those packages now in fedora the vast

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,839
majority of our packages and it's well

00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:09,279
over three quarters it might in fact be

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,230
over eighty percent now we have

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,930
something like 10,000 packages available

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:15,250
for fedora and over eighty percent of

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:19,060
those packages are maintained by

00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:23,370
volunteers so what we try and do is

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:26,139
encourage those folks to to follow

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:27,910
ecologically sound practices of getting

00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:29,319
those bugs moved upstream working with

00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:31,149
the upstream community and getting it

00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,730
included in the code that is later going

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,550
to come not back not just back to fedora

00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:39,610
but back to all these distributions

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:42,250
everywhere right so I always think about

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,410
that is not strip mining the open source

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,389
ecosystem right because you're not just

00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:49,149
carrying a load yourself what you also

00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:51,790
do by keeping patches in your you know

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:55,420
in your package that don't go back to

00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:58,660
the upstream is that you are radically

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,759
changing the nature of how open source

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,339
is experienced from one distribution to

00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,720
another and overall that actually really

00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:08,290
hurts open source because it makes

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:11,230
people think that it's a very it's a

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,329
very chaotic landscape out of which no

00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,740
order and no semblance of sanity is ever

00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:16,630
going to be found and I think those of

00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,670
us who've worked in it for a while know

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:21,220
that although it is an evolutionary

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:23,620
process and there is chaos in it

00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,439
ultimately out of that chaos comes order

00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,209
because we do forge consensus on what

00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:30,459
makes good code right that's the that's

00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:33,009
the essence of many eyeballs is bringing

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:35,589
a lot of a lot of good minds to code and

00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:37,870
then that code gets refined and improved

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,360
and eventually moved out to more people

00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:44,259
so these practices make that make that

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,379
possible something else that's important

00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:48,779
about why we concentrate on contributors

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:51,819
is that we found that it produces

00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,920
measurable results and I can give you an

00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:54,470
example measurable results actually a

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,320
couple for

00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:59,450
from our Fedora teams our infrastructure

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,670
team which is actually run by a fellow

00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,890
named Mike McGrath has been actually we

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,020
hired him as a result of his

00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,690
infrastructure work a couple years ago

00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:11,380
and he runs that team now and

00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:14,510
essentially we have and around the world

00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:17,210
mainly volunteer staff of system

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:19,010
administrators and they run all of our

00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,350
infrastructure everything that you see

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,950
running fedora on the backend is

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,570
contained in kolos actually in many

00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:28,700
different areas around the world we

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,580
mirror from one place to another we've

00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:33,410
got complete fault tolerance we've run a

00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,390
lot of our services on virtualization

00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:37,280
the same sort of stuff that you here

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:39,710
open-source vendors trying to sell

00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:41,120
people that's what we use and we know it

00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:43,100
works because you know we're supporting

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,100
essentially tens of thousands of people

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,870
around the world every day with almost

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,880
no downtime right when we do have

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,860
downtime it's usually planned and we

00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,290
tell everybody about it in advance so we

00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:56,060
run very much like a like a company

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:01,640
would only we're run by our own

00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:05,420
volunteers that infrastructure has saved

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:08,570
us it saved us count countless dollars

00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,980
and probably a lot of heartache one

00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,590
example the infrastructure we use is

00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:14,210
mirror manager which controls our mirror

00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,190
system around the world that's where

00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:19,190
people download fedora when you download

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:21,530
from download dolphin or project org or

00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:23,210
mirrors da fedora project org you get

00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:26,270
redirected to a mirror that's close to

00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:28,580
you using some Geographic code that

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:32,570
figures out where is where is a good

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:34,550
site for you and by doing that we solved

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:35,750
a problem for red hat and I'll tell you

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:37,870
a little story about that back in the

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:40,640
days of i believe it was fedora core six

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:42,380
when we release fedora core six and that

00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:44,150
would have been in about two thousand

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:47,630
six if i remember correctly late two

00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:49,040
thousand six back then red hat was

00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,810
basically still providing all the

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,880
infrastructure and bandwidth out of one

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:56,920
place and so the day that we released

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,780
fedora core six we melted their router

00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:01,420
and i mean literally melted there was

00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:04,540
the insides were goo

00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,950
and that's how the it we were at a

00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,080
hundred percent capacity for I think

00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:09,250
about an hour and a half and I you know

00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,200
I don't know if a cooler broke down or

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,340
what but essentially we destroyed this

00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,530
incredibly expensive piece of equipment

00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:17,800
they had and they weren't real happy

00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:19,980
about it so we made it we made it a

00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,150
point yeah who would have thought um

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,940
hang on just hang on a second while I

00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:27,760
sneeze out some more money now that

00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:29,290
doesn't happen let me tell you so um so

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,210
what we decided to do is to come up with

00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:32,770
a system that was a hundred percent free

00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,630
and open-source again run by our

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,730
volunteers which would spread this load

00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:38,620
out among many many different sites

00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,450
around the world and and we've done that

00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:43,660
and through mirror manager were also

00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:45,310
much better able to track downloads so

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,810
for example we know that we've had in

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:49,240
the past four or five days about a

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:51,910
quarter million downloads direct

00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:53,920
downloads of fedora 11 just through our

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:55,720
mirror manager now people are also

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,040
downloading directly from sites near

00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,590
them and we don't really have a good way

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,060
of counting that but we do know that and

00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,450
we also know that for example we've

00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,740
shipped something like sixty or seventy

00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:07,840
thousand more copies by BitTorrent

00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,570
already which comes to some number or

00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:13,900
hundred and some terabytes of data in

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:16,930
just the first few days so all that is

00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:19,120
going out to a lot of eager people so

00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:20,890
that's an example of a measurable you

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,270
know a measurable output another

00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:23,980
measurable output is our community run

00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:26,650
website the web that actually fronts all

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,510
this is run by our community it's a it's

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,760
a version control completely

00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:33,520
translatable website our community

00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,350
translators translated into well over a

00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,030
dozen and a half languages so if you're

00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:39,250
in a different region and you go to our

00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:44,310
fedora project website you'll get a

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:46,690
version its translated for for your area

00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:48,940
something else that measure that

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:51,730
measurable contributions provide is a

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,110
link to people right and there's this

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:54,610
really ugly gone the right but the other

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,390
guy the handsome young fellow right

00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:01,030
there his name is Ricky Zhao and he is

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,970
the lead for our websites team has been

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:05,920
for about a year or so and Ricky came to

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:08,350
us out of the blue and wanted to do

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:11,260
something that was finite and measurable

00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:14,410
and he had some some background and

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:15,310
running websites at high school so Ricky

00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,350
this picture

00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,320
was taking Ricky was I think not quite

00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:21,850
yet 17 and he was going to be hell he

00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:24,910
was going to be heading off to Carnegie

00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,620
Mellon University in the fall so to help

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,690
provide an incentive for people like

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,550
Ricky young people who want to get some

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:33,330
job experience but you know don't have a

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,520
resume built up for you know maybe a

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,070
large company like red hat we provide

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,620
him a way to do that and we actually

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:43,900
established a fedora scholarship and

00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:45,760
Ricky was our our first recipient of

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,770
that scholarship and our second

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,810
recipient scholarship is due to be

00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:52,390
announced I believed at the end of this

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,580
month or beginning of July so stay tuned

00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:56,860
for that will be will be awarding

00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:01,300
another another helpful young person

00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:03,700
some college money by the way if you

00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:09,670
know somebody who is who is into earning

00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:12,670
some college money send them our way so

00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:14,080
the other thing that one of the other

00:18:12,670 --> 00:18:16,480
things that we try to concentrate on

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,700
when it comes to concentrate on

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,550
contributors is the way that it

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:22,810
encourages radical transparency what we

00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:25,000
like to think of as radical transparency

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,730
we try and make everything as open and

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,990
transparent in the Fedora project as

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,460
possible and what what that means is

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,920
that the people who work in the federal

00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:35,170
project have a stake in the project

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,240
right if they can see what's going on

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:39,040
everywhere in the project then they know

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,980
the effects that they have across the

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,410
project and it makes them feel some some

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:49,080
ownership and some responsibility and

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:52,360
also a deeper affinity for the project

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,710
so that that openness means that all of

00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,870
these building blocks that we produce

00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:59,530
are one hundred percent free and open

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:02,080
source software that is the one rule in

00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:04,750
fedora that we never ever go against so

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,370
everything that we build in fedora one

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,320
hundred percent free and open source

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:12,280
software so whether you're looking at

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,100
our website our build system our content

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,990
the are the contents of our Fedora

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:21,130
hosted org system where we host other

00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:23,290
projects our translations the spec files

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,300
for building our packages everything

00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:27,190
from soup to nuts is a hundred percent

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,999
free and open source we only run on free

00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:30,259
and open-source platforms and some

00:19:28,999 --> 00:19:32,569
and so forth and some people might call

00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:38,089
that religious I call it good sense

00:19:32,569 --> 00:19:39,919
because it works all right anyone can

00:19:38,089 --> 00:19:41,509
take these building blocks as a result

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,919
of their being free and open source and

00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:46,549
they can turn them into something new

00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:49,309
and I like to think of that as keeping

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,109
us honest right if somebody decides that

00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,059
we are we as the Fedora project right

00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:54,949
whoever that we is Right whether it's

00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:56,629
the leadership here or a specific team

00:19:54,949 --> 00:19:58,429
whatever the case may be they just

00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:01,159
decide the whole project is just dead

00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:02,749
wrong they can actually take a copy of

00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,179
everything we do and again it's

00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:07,369
everything soup to nuts they can take a

00:20:05,179 --> 00:20:10,219
copy and fork our entire project out

00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:13,699
from under us and if they're right we

00:20:10,219 --> 00:20:17,029
lose right so we are incented to treat

00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:18,739
our community well just as we want our

00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:21,019
community members to treat each other

00:20:18,739 --> 00:20:23,089
well right so it's a it's a nice check

00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:25,219
and balance so those building blocks can

00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:26,839
become something new now Clint savages

00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:29,599
up here in front bridge Hannah Clint

00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:31,639
Clinton a a little piece earlier on

00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,769
on-ree mixing fedora and that's a you

00:20:31,639 --> 00:20:36,199
know that's one piece of this all free

00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:37,459
and open-source idea that's very

00:20:36,199 --> 00:20:39,229
powerful you can put right in people's

00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:40,729
hands they can remix our distribution in

00:20:39,229 --> 00:20:42,949
many different ways so that's one way

00:20:40,729 --> 00:20:45,679
that that that that redistributed

00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:48,349
redistribute ability helps but it also

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,059
means that it helps contributors be

00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:52,339
motivated because they know that what

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,289
they're doing is not going to disappear

00:20:52,339 --> 00:20:56,269
into a black hole somewhere right it's

00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:58,339
going to go out into the world and help

00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:00,439
people anybody can grab a copy of it if

00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:02,809
I'm working on a project in our hosted

00:21:00,439 --> 00:21:04,549
system anybody can grab that they can

00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:06,229
they can copy it they can contribute to

00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:08,059
it they can redistribute it they could

00:21:06,229 --> 00:21:09,589
sell it if they want they could for kit

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,779
if you know if they're going to do a

00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:13,639
better job I'd say have at it right

00:21:11,779 --> 00:21:15,109
that's what open source is about is all

00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,479
that freedom right there's nothing

00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:19,159
locked away in a closet it also means

00:21:17,479 --> 00:21:22,279
that the people we're working in the

00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:24,859
project are able to build a transparent

00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:26,779
resume that they can show to anybody

00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,859
right in these kind of times it's good

00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:29,719
to have that sort of thing on your

00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:31,879
resume to be able to show people the

00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:33,199
kind of work of which you're capable all

00:21:31,879 --> 00:21:36,739
right so you can do that transparently

00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:39,279
in fedora and what that means is the the

00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:41,899
return yeah the return on investment for

00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:42,650
contributors is really great and so what

00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:45,110
happens

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:49,610
is you get these immensely overstaffed

00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:52,400
booths at shows like this uh and you get

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:56,330
you know all sorts of people you get you

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,670
know you get fat people you get skinny

00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:02,210
people you know people with no hair

00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:05,600
people with too much hair all sorts of

00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,280
people on and and they feel they feel an

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:09,080
affinity for fedora they they're

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,000
invested in it because they know that

00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,560
what they're building is going to be a

00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,410
hundred percent out there to help other

00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:19,760
people grow as well so I'll tell you

00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:21,530
some examples of how we engage

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,630
contributors and you know maybe there's

00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:25,760
some lessons in here for for your team

00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:27,500
for your project maybe for your company

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,230
if you're if you're interested in open

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:34,790
source you know again feel free to take

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:36,800
that's that's what we do so by

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,960
encouraging contributors I don't mean

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,540
imposing on contributors right they're

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,150
able to find their own way but sometimes

00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:46,070
people come into 2 into a community of

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,230
contributors and they want so badly to

00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:50,090
put in time and they're not exactly sure

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,520
house so some of the things that we

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,500
found work really well are simple

00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:56,270
organizational rules that really work

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,540
well for any kind of process that you're

00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:02,300
doing it does anybody here read you know

00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:03,710
any number of any number of the common

00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,140
and self-help books things like you know

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,480
the get getting things done and stuff

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,550
like that yeah I mean there's shelves

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,140
full of this stuff right and and hidden

00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:14,090
deep in there is like the secret code to

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,320
unlock the entire universe but you can't

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:17,660
find it in just one book you have to

00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,550
read like 25 of them and ferret it out

00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:22,880
for yourself I haven't I'm only its book

00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:24,050
23 so on that's I have to still stick

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,030
around and do these speeches because

00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:28,100
when I read book 25 that's where you

00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:29,670
know this hollow shell Falls often it

00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:31,490
would float away or something

00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:35,370
I'll be in the next plane of existence

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,050
doing speeches again probably and those

00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:42,270
people will look just as unhappy as you

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:45,570
do so what are some of the things that

00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,550
that that that we believe help encourage

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,380
contributors and again not imposing but

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:51,030
how do we encourage them the people who

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,710
are coming in once so badly to give and

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:53,790
need some directions well one of the

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,850
things you can do is set measurable

00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,650
milestones right set set milestones that

00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,480
people can achieve and and that means

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:01,800
you not just one person at the top of

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,210
the project but a team leader can

00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:06,300
actually give that person a chunk of

00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:08,580
work to do one of the things that I've

00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:11,190
asked our teams to do in fedora at in

00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:13,020
the wake of fedora 11 release for the

00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:14,490
first time and you know I think this is

00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,050
on everybody's mind but I wanted to make

00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,510
it into more of a more of a big deal

00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,970
more of a process I wanted to ask our

00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:24,090
team leaders what is one achievable goal

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,430
for your team for the next few months

00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:28,560
what do you think you could do before we

00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:30,540
start heating up the you know our

00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,010
development cycle to the point where

00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:34,200
we're going to be concentrating on on

00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:36,750
really beating bugs out and we all get

00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,670
involved in sort of stabilizing that

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,700
release what can we do in the in the in

00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:43,800
the time between the release of fedora

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,510
11 and the time that we start doing that

00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,180
work for fedora 12 there's a couple

00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:49,950
months of really good time to be had

00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,740
there where you're not under a lot of

00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:54,480
pressure for that release so what can we

00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:55,910
do in that time that would be

00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,210
interesting and more importantly what

00:24:55,910 --> 00:25:02,880
that goal must be something that's

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,310
oriented around making your team's

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,500
experience in fedora project better

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:08,940
what's going to improve life for them

00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:11,160
what's a goal that we can achieve

00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,640
improved life and and you know for

00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:18,720
example uh you know one idea would be uh

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:21,690
you know switching switching source code

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,400
control systems right that might be one

00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,440
way that you could you can improve life

00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,030
for contributors right certainly there's

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,110
going to be a bunch of people are going

00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:29,430
to get in a room they're going to fight

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,350
it out and figure out which one's going

00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,690
to be best for them and it'll be all you

00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,740
know dirty and and muddy and people

00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:36,150
throwing rocks at each other but

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,950
eventually the end they come out with a

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,430
good answer and everybody says all right

00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,460
good fight let's go home and and

00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:45,370
work together now so that's an example

00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:46,870
of an achievable goal so the next thing

00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,700
you have to figure out is what is the

00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:50,290
next action required to get there so if

00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,490
you're giving this goal to somebody you

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:56,050
want to you want to give them an

00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:57,910
explicit direction to go in right

00:25:56,050 --> 00:26:00,130
telling somebody hey we're glad you here

00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:02,470
we're glad you here um you know read all

00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,920
our documentation and you know join like

00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,890
eight lists and you know do this and do

00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,410
that and hey you'll be a contributor

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:13,840
right that that's that's not a lot of

00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:16,990
direction to give people really what

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,550
they need are achievable goals and when

00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:23,260
you give them a next action to take

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:25,540
which is find person x on IRC and ask

00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:27,400
him how you would carry out this task

00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:29,260
right that's something measurable it's

00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,910
small its bite sized and somebody can do

00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:32,950
it in an evening they just wait for

00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:35,680
person x to be around and talk to him

00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:37,390
and start engaging and that means that

00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:39,490
they've now made a social contact which

00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:40,630
you know again strengthens these bonds

00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,390
and the affinity that people have for

00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:45,670
for the project so I like to think of

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:50,230
the next action if you can wrap a social

00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:52,270
action and do it that's always best all

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:54,160
right this is also important if you're

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:55,510
dealing with a team now okay getting

00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,660
away from new contributors but if you've

00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:00,040
got an established team of people when

00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,690
you're when you figure out these goals

00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:03,310
and these next actions something that's

00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:05,560
very important to figure out who's going

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,210
to do it and what I've found is very

00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:08,740
common in open source communities all

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,380
over all over the world and I don't

00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:12,910
think this is specific to fedora at all

00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:16,300
we have a tendency to overuse the word

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:18,280
we write and we say we when we when we

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:20,200
mean we should do this and what we

00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:22,860
really mean is someone should do this

00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,970
but not me

00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,920
except when I say it it's true because

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,990
really I'm not smart enough to do it so

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,510
I it's better than I don't do it really

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,310
but someone should really honestly

00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,350
someone else should get this speech as a

00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:40,030
matter of fact we should give this

00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:42,340
speech no no we as we as a very easy

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,350
word to fall back on right and we is

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:45,730
very inclusive it's a wonderful word and

00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:47,470
it means a lot of things do a lot of

00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,710
people unfortunately one of the things

00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:52,690
it means is a lack of accountability

00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,090
right so if you keep saying we up until

00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:57,460
the point that your your your time to

00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,680
complete the whatever this this task is

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,330
done you arrive at the point you go oh

00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,730
my god it didn't get done why is that

00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:06,490
well because we didn't do it so you all

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,110
look over it we and say we you are not

00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:09,670
coming back to this project we do not

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,670
trust you anymore and you can't do that

00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:15,250
so who is going to do it you need to

00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:17,950
find accountability and it needs to be

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:21,420
done in a way that is authentic it needs

00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:24,130
to be in in terms of a friendship and

00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,100
not just responsibility but it turned in

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,810
terms of affinity for your fellow human

00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:30,340
being right you're you're talking to

00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:32,170
somebody who is coming because they want

00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,370
to give and you don't want to smack them

00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,960
down with a task and say you're going to

00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:36,640
do this about God you better get it done

00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,410
that's not the right way to approach it

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,330
what is the right way to approach it is

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:42,430
to find people who are interested in a

00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:44,590
certain task or to find someone who

00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,330
hasn't raised their hand because they're

00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,400
afraid that they're going to step on

00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:51,250
somebody's toes which is far more often

00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,810
the case you say so and so you've been

00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:54,880
around for a couple weeks on this

00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:56,200
particular task doesn't look really it's

00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,390
not really difficult there's only a

00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,790
couple steps required and it would take

00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:03,310
about an hour of work is that something

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:04,600
you feel that you're ready to do do you

00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:06,280
think like do you think you would need

00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,990
help to do we can get somebody to help

00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:10,030
you through it right those are all

00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:11,590
things that that come along with this so

00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:14,740
again it's not an imposition you're

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,260
encouraging people and I hit the I

00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,130
apparently hit the wrong key again so

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:19,960
we're going to go through a bit of this

00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:22,990
but let me go back and see if I can redo

00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,870
this better than I did before did I pass

00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:28,060
where I was i think i passed i was going

00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:31,090
to do it oh there we go then the most

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,070
important rule once you have teams that

00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,230
are doing this work and once you've got

00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:36,060
these actions assigned get out of the

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:38,070
way and this is

00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:40,140
than that Joe brockmeyer zongker who

00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:43,170
spoke this morning and I really see eye

00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,540
to eye on you absolutely have to get out

00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,560
of the way of your contributors and I'm

00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:50,040
going to talk more about that in a

00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:52,950
second but when you look at all of these

00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,050
these issues that I just talked about it

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,580
seems like it's sort of regimented right

00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:59,400
it seems like it's some sort of attack

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,690
plan to get your community mobilized and

00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,950
if you can only give the right people

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,720
the right orders at the right time

00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:05,760
everything will magically come together

00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,260
it's not really it doesn't really work

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,540
that way right it still has a very

00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:15,510
organic feel to it but the point of of

00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:19,350
having these these these little tidbits

00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,600
in your mind is that it's going to bring

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,410
you to a place where you've actually

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,560
accomplished something when you look

00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:28,230
back on that on that timeframe and we

00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:30,270
found that when you look back on tasks

00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,100
that have been completed in this way it

00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:33,630
really makes you motivated because you

00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:36,420
look back and think wow two and two

00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:38,700
months look what we did we achieve this

00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:41,280
we rolled out a new content management

00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,220
system we have a new source control repo

00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:48,180
we just redid the way that we that we

00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:50,130
roll our our rapid our rabbit release

00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,440
development cycle we change the way that

00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,790
we tag packages right there are a

00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,740
million things that you can look back on

00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:59,670
and say we did this right and that's the

00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,220
right place for the word we write so

00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:05,750
people take accountability and in a good

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,920
community they share the they share the

00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:10,560
the the good things that come out of

00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:14,730
that they they share the accolades right

00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:19,380
so this is the right place for we all

00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:20,760
right so um I also think that if you

00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,010
want to engage contributors you have to

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:25,440
have a long-term strategy for growing

00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:26,940
participation and it has to be more than

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,380
just you know finding people on the

00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:30,210
street and recruiting them it's got to

00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:32,610
be you know their hat you have to

00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:34,200
actually engineer solutions that grow

00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:37,950
participation this is something that's a

00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,110
very big deal for us in fedora and what

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,490
that means you know again if you if you

00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:43,080
want to do things the right way in my

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:44,070
opinion you have to avoid the temptation

00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,000
of band

00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:49,590
right it's very easy to say well okay I

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,090
know this needs I know what we really

00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:54,240
need to get done here is we need to have

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,730
some facility for people to contribute

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,280
and help and collaborate in doing this

00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,810
task but it really would be easier if I

00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,580
just go do it myself right now if I just

00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:03,960
get this task done yeah it's going to

00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,280
take me a few hours all about myself ER

00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:08,630
is going to take me a few days but it'll

00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:12,720
be done right but if you keep doing that

00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:14,280
you have limited the amount of you I'm

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,170
sorry you've limited the ability for

00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:17,820
your contributors to help you've limited

00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:20,520
the way that they can collaborate with

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:22,200
you um and it's you know it's very

00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,420
tempting to do that especially if you

00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:26,970
feel like you have that skill but the

00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,480
point for any of any community leader is

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:32,490
to teach others and build solutions that

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,110
help them succeed not do all the work

00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:35,610
yourself and you know I talked about

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:38,430
Mike McGrath in the infrastructure team

00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:40,770
earlier and that's a great it's a great

00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:42,750
example of somebody who has built up a

00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:45,030
team basically from scratch by teaching

00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,130
others to do so that he doesn't have to

00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:49,620
answer every page because we have people

00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:52,440
covering our infrastructure who live in

00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:55,050
London and who live in Paris and who

00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,050
live in Stuttgart and who live in India

00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:59,340
and who live in Australia right so we

00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,720
have this kind of follow the Sun

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,820
infrastructure team so one person

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,650
doesn't have to carry all that load or

00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,960
two people or three people it's you know

00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,820
quite a lot more so band-aids are

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,390
tempting but what you gain from teaching

00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:14,880
others is immeasurably better all right

00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:17,280
then you have my new my new mantra they

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,080
hit by a bus mantra this if you're going

00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,610
to encourage your contributors the one

00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,740
question you need to ask yourself every

00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,540
day is what would happen today what

00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,020
would happen to this team this project

00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:29,220
is code if I got hit by a bus now some

00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,510
people think that's really harsh when I

00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,720
when I came up with a hit by a bus

00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:34,590
analogy struck people that that just was

00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,570
a little close to home because you

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,370
actually could get hit by a bus and that

00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:40,020
seemed just you know with the worries

00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:42,030
about insurance costs and things like

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,380
that people didn't like that so one of

00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:46,250
our other community members came up well

00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,250
what if you won the lottery

00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:52,029
have you won the lottery okay well i

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,120
don't know if that's really apt because

00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:57,789
I'll tell you um honest in all honesty

00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,919
and you know cross my heart hope to die

00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:02,320
I swear on the lives of my two children

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,860
if I won the lottery tomorrow if i won

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,509
Powerball like 250 million dollars I

00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,280
might quit my project leader job but I

00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:12,129
would be involved in fedora the rest of

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,020
my life all the time right I'd still do

00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:16,419
it full time for fun because that's how

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:17,589
great it is right so won the lottery

00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:19,149
doesn't really work because I think

00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:21,550
really a lot of people would stay around

00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:23,349
so we came up with a good halfway point

00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,069
which I think works which is eaten by

00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:26,069
Raptors

00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:35,559
so obviously no one I think out there is

00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:38,319
truly worried they're going to be in by

00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:42,010
a raptor if you are I please lay off the

00:34:38,319 --> 00:34:44,679
sauce that's okay at least after tonight

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,089
right after the after party um so eaten

00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:47,889
by Raptors not likely to happen but the

00:34:46,089 --> 00:34:49,599
question you're really asking is what

00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:52,210
would happen to my team or my project if

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,950
you know if I left tomorrow do they have

00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:58,660
the tools that they need to succeed if

00:34:53,950 --> 00:35:00,640
they don't you are in the way okay it's

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,510
as simple as that right if they don't

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,190
have the tools they need to succeed

00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,329
you're in the way and you need to get

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,819
out of the way remember that rule

00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:08,650
earlier so that means you want to spend

00:35:06,819 --> 00:35:12,030
more time building things that scale out

00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:15,579
and allow more collaboration all right

00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:19,329
whoops I've done it again I keep hitting

00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:20,559
the any key apparently all right okay

00:35:19,329 --> 00:35:21,609
well we can go on to getting out of the

00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,430
way since since we're on that subject

00:35:21,609 --> 00:35:25,630
anyway I'm going to have to disable that

00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:28,720
little touch pad thing because it's

00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:31,119
really dangerous apparently the mission

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,150
for any team leader is to grow their

00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,690
team and I think ultimately the mission

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,790
for somebody who is a project lead or or

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:42,640
in a pretty high position a project is

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:45,339
to make themselves as obsolete as

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:47,530
possible right there are times where a

00:35:45,339 --> 00:35:49,299
project leader is needed I don't foresee

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,069
a time when Fedora would net would not

00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:52,839
have a project leader because there are

00:35:51,069 --> 00:35:54,910
too many benefits that the project gets

00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:56,530
out of it and there are also benefits

00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,910
that Red Hat gets out of it in this

00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,410
course is the main sponsor we want to

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:00,960
make sure that Fedora stays healthy and

00:35:59,410 --> 00:36:03,069
is doing what it needs to do to succeed

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,900
so I feel like we'll always have

00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:06,339
somebody where the buck you know the

00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:09,220
buck is going to stop here and I

00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:12,849
actually if I can get out of my pants or

00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:14,559
my fat posterior I actually have the

00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:16,750
Fedora buck right here this is given to

00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:18,190
me by Max Spivak and it sits in my wall

00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:20,140
and that's what reminds me every day

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:22,480
that this is where the buck stops if

00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:26,020
something happens in fedora this is the

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,940
one throat to choke right here but aside

00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:29,230
from that you want to get out of the way

00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:32,290
as much as possible now give you an

00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,530
example of how getting out of the way is

00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:37,630
important we have we have a lot of

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:40,750
Fedora ambassadors that made it down to

00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:41,760
this to this event David David nolley is

00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:43,770
one of our

00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,210
our great ambassadors on a Clint savage

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:46,560
and I think we've got a couple are there

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,790
any other Footwear ambassadors back

00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,260
there I think Ben's back there right

00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:53,160
raise your hand or stand up or something

00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:56,760
right mr. to coningsburgh very good so

00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:59,790
we have so we've got am and thank you so

00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,450
we have a we have ambassadors that are

00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:05,580
are people who sort of do the groundwork

00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,530
right they are the people who talk to

00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:09,090
people they press the flesh where we can

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,830
right we can't be everywhere so the

00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,780
ambassadors are out there because they

00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,980
believe what fedoras doing and they want

00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,260
people to know about it and they want

00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,270
them to know you know how this how this

00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,980
project works and what makes it

00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,630
distinctive and what makes it cool and

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,760
what makes it the kind of place where

00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,770
somebody would you know win a powerball

00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:28,080
and still stick around for you know 10

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:33,090
or 12 hours a day you know God well

00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:35,460
other than insanity of course so we had

00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:41,310
we have consistently had problems with

00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:43,980
with ambassadors with ambassadors not

00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:47,130
being able to achieve certain goals

00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,330
right they they wanted to have media for

00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:51,240
shows to be able to give it out to

00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:53,280
people and we at Red Hat we're always in

00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,450
the way of that we ordered them from we

00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,040
had to go order from a printing company

00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:57,480
and we had to do all these deals and

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,450
purchase orders and all this crazy stuff

00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:02,490
and eventually what we would get is you

00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,230
know a bunch of media for for example

00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:06,330
like for fedora 9 releases you guys

00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:08,280
remember was you know not really that

00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:10,200
well made I mean the covers were kind of

00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:12,270
off kilter and didn't look real good it

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,610
wasn't very professional and we paid I

00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:17,850
think like a buck 70 or something for

00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:19,710
each piece of media it was insane we

00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,630
asked our ambassadors to help please

00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,490
please help us because we obviously do

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:25,410
not know what we're doing and these guys

00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:27,330
turn around they found not only did they

00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:29,340
they find a place that produced the

00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:31,020
media well they set up an entire

00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:32,940
shipping system for around the country

00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:35,130
so if anybody in our project needs media

00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,990
they can basically put a ticket in with

00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:39,600
with one of the ambassador's issue

00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:42,630
ticket systems and say hey I need a 100

00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:45,000
live CDs can you send them in a by the

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:46,230
Tuesday after next sure no problem and

00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,640
they get it there and we just simply

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,380
handle the shipping bills they just come

00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,290
to us and we just we just pay them and

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:53,960
that that costs us I think something

00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:56,000
like 65 cents

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,830
a piece of media now so basically you

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,390
know by getting out of the way we

00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:04,280
dropped sixty-seven percent of our costs

00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,780
it's just one example of how you need to

00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,010
let your community do what they do best

00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:13,580
which is everything that you can't do

00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:15,740
all right um finally I guess I went as

00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,790
far as engaging contributors I want to

00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,470
leave you with another thought which is

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,410
a growing community is essentially like

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:23,630
compounding interest it's something that

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:26,630
it takes willpower you have to do it

00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:28,849
regularly you need to be devoted to it

00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:30,680
every day and it's never too late to

00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:32,869
start but the earlier you start the

00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,790
better all right the same things go for

00:39:32,869 --> 00:39:39,349
your savings account as they do for

00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:43,970
growing your community right what time

00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:46,520
are we at now when do we start about 20

00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:47,930
after okay all right take about five

00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,849
minutes here and I'm going to wrap up

00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:53,630
real quick so those of your snooze in

00:39:49,849 --> 00:39:54,530
the back just continue snoring I'm going

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,900
to talk to you about the four

00:39:54,530 --> 00:40:00,589
foundations what came out of this

00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:02,780
contributor focus for us was a way to

00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:05,810
talk about our core values in our

00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:07,580
project as as something very separate

00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:09,349
and very distinct from red hat you know

00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,849
and we're we in the project are very

00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:12,950
grateful for red hat for what they do

00:40:10,849 --> 00:40:14,839
for us they provide money they provide

00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:18,200
people's support they provide bandwidth

00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:20,240
they provide you know press relations

00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,130
there's there's innumerable things that

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,609
they do for us they leave free legal

00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:27,140
counsel all sorts of great stuff but we

00:40:25,609 --> 00:40:29,930
really are separate and distinct from

00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,640
them in some in some important ways and

00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:33,260
we wanted to have a way of stating that

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,330
we wanted to have a way of saying what

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,950
we fedora stood for and what we agree on

00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,680
and so we came up with these four

00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:41,900
foundations and and eventually somebody

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,619
created some some really nice art to

00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,450
show these things off so um in turn you

00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:50,000
know we talked about these four

00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,589
foundations the first one is freedom and

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,270
talked a little about that earlier a

00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:55,520
hundred percent free and open source

00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,290
software that is all we do everything we

00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,680
build and everything we make in fedora

00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:02,930
whether its content or whether it's web

00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,970
code or whether it's our build system

00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:06,349
anything we do it's a hundred percent

00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:07,550
free and open source and it's all

00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:09,560
available to anybody

00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:12,800
to use copy for whatever purpose they

00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:14,900
want the other thing we believe is that

00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,580
we do not believe in restricting users

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,410
and that includes their ability to

00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,570
redistribute and that's a very fine

00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:23,180
point right we do not believe in

00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:26,180
restricting users right to go get

00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,460
solutions that may be legally encumbered

00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:30,200
for some Fedora people right we believe

00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,210
in making it possible for them to do

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,840
that but we do not include those

00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:38,090
solutions things like oh the dreaded mp3

00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,580
right which has that it's legally

00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:42,070
encumbered by patents in some parts of

00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,150
the world including the United States

00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:46,040
there are many other pieces of code that

00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:48,980
have similar types of encumbrances it's

00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:51,800
a dirty problem and we believe in

00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:54,950
fighting that to the bitter deathly end

00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:56,750
but things are as they are right now and

00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:58,430
we want fedora to continue despite that

00:41:56,750 --> 00:42:00,160
we would rather not be sued into the

00:41:58,430 --> 00:42:02,480
ground by somebody use a patent holder

00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,120
you know it'd be nice for daddy red hat

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,680
to to defend us but in in the end really

00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,420
we'd like to just kind of avoid that

00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,140
spend more time thinking about actually

00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:15,080
doing real open-source work so we do not

00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,090
what we try and do is is not restrict

00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,830
users ability to redistribute by not

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,510
putting those kinds of things in fedora

00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:22,460
because we want to be one hundred

00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:24,230
percent free and redistributable for

00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:26,390
everyone which means if you take fedora

00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,950
and remix it whatever you get we want

00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:29,510
you to be able to distribute to

00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:31,520
everybody without worrying about legal

00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:33,080
restrictions and that's not true of a

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,490
lot of the encumbrance stuff out there

00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,740
right you can install it on your machine

00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,480
but if you mix something with it and put

00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:40,940
it all together in one thing and hand it

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,380
out it may not be redistributable

00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:44,300
depending on where you live that's

00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,950
that's a very tough situation to be in

00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:49,520
if you're a if you're a free software

00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:51,080
advocate um so we do not believe in

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:53,600
cutting corners when it comes to that

00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:57,560
and and you know in my personal

00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:58,700
viewpoint the best reason for for being

00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:00,470
a hundred percent free and open source

00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:02,870
is that there is no point in talking the

00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:04,220
talk if you do not walk the walk right

00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:06,530
that's why everything that we do from

00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:09,620
soup to nuts is a hundred percent open

00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:11,660
source right and i think that sends a

00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:13,280
message also that you know we get to

00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:14,589
send a message that it is good enough

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:16,509
for you and that means

00:43:14,589 --> 00:43:17,829
is good enough for us to write we're

00:43:16,509 --> 00:43:19,450
going to tell you that free software is

00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:20,410
wonderful we're going to show you it's

00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,640
wonderful when we're going to build

00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:26,170
these things with it that's how you're

00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:27,940
going to know all right friends I think

00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:29,950
everybody has something to give we have

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,450
many teams in fedora art and design

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,509
translation people who are doing

00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:36,579
documentation people who just simply

00:43:34,509 --> 00:43:39,609
spend time in an IRC room explaining

00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:41,170
things to other people politely if you

00:43:39,609 --> 00:43:42,519
would like to become a party it's a very

00:43:41,170 --> 00:43:44,200
if you'd like to become a part of it or

00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:46,630
it's very easy to do that you simply go

00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,180
to join dot fedora project org sign up

00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,769
for an account and yet you can click a

00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,420
little yes I agree to the contributor

00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:55,210
license agreement which basically means

00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:57,609
that you are telling us that what you're

00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:59,559
going to give us is free and we're free

00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:01,509
to redistribute it not only that but we

00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:03,400
are you are allowing us to keep it free

00:44:01,509 --> 00:44:07,809
for other people without giving up your

00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:10,180
copyright okay so right now because

00:44:07,809 --> 00:44:11,979
we've made that that system so easy in

00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:14,950
the last year and a half hour number of

00:44:11,979 --> 00:44:17,890
account holders has skyrocketed not all

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:21,069
those people become contributors we're

00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:23,049
at about 30,000 account holders now but

00:44:21,069 --> 00:44:25,660
not all those people are contributors

00:44:23,049 --> 00:44:28,210
about 14,000 of them have signed our

00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:29,680
contributor license agreement do I think

00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,200
all fourteen thousand of them are in

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,269
fedora every day doing tasks no i don't

00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,479
but if you look at that pyramid i'm

00:44:34,269 --> 00:44:39,430
pretty sure about 2,000 are and that's a

00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:41,619
lot of people that's it that's a full

00:44:39,430 --> 00:44:44,589
sized company Red Hat has I think what

00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:47,109
2900 and some employees 3,000 did we hit

00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:49,049
3000 okay so we are about the size that

00:44:47,109 --> 00:44:52,119
red hat was me at two or three years ago

00:44:49,049 --> 00:44:55,420
right that's a that's a sizable that's a

00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,430
sizable concern I'm out of this out of

00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,609
this friendship that binds us together

00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:02,289
the common purpose we sometimes have

00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:04,869
disagreements about how things should be

00:45:02,289 --> 00:45:06,549
done but what we always do is we discuss

00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,589
it right we talked about it with each

00:45:06,549 --> 00:45:10,680
other and ultimately we reach some kind

00:45:08,589 --> 00:45:13,150
of consensus right that consensus may be

00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,309
that the people who are going to do the

00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:16,719
work are going to make the call right if

00:45:15,309 --> 00:45:18,069
we if we can't reach some sort of

00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,469
consensus the people who are going to

00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:22,660
put in the elbow grease get us say how

00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:24,729
it's done right and that's how you keep

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,219
from stagnating everything cannot be a

00:45:24,729 --> 00:45:28,150
vote right every turning everything into

00:45:27,219 --> 00:45:30,849
a vote

00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:33,490
a quagmire somebody at some point has to

00:45:30,849 --> 00:45:35,200
step up and lead so as friends we

00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:37,539
realize that and we commit we have a

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,089
commitment to each other not to stand in

00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:42,130
the way of consensus for trivial things

00:45:40,089 --> 00:45:43,510
okay and that's how we can keep that

00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:47,500
that's how we can keep that movement

00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:49,599
going as far as features uh you know I

00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,950
don't think anybody can argue with the

00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,599
technical features that come out of the

00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:56,010
Fedora project a lot of our contributors

00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:59,799
are involved very deeply in the

00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:01,359
communities that power everything you

00:45:59,799 --> 00:46:02,619
guys are running in free software right

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:04,980
there are fedora contributors out there

00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:08,440
working in things like the colonel and

00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:11,010
xorg which powers your GUI and G Lib C

00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:14,140
which you know basically everything uses

00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:15,640
you know the the shells and utilities

00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:17,680
that you use at a command line or that

00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:19,089
you build gooeys around a lot of those

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,559
things are you know we have fedora

00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:22,000
contributors were involved very heavily

00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,349
in those upstream communities as a

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,359
matter of fact I actually just found out

00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:27,099
the other day that we have out of our

00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:29,289
out of our community of contributors we

00:46:27,099 --> 00:46:31,869
have I believe nineteen people who were

00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:34,779
invited to the plumbers conference to

00:46:31,869 --> 00:46:36,730
speak there and you know it so it's

00:46:34,779 --> 00:46:39,819
quite a bit more than the the next

00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:41,319
nearest the next nearest lunch so it's

00:46:39,819 --> 00:46:42,609
something that you know I think we're

00:46:41,319 --> 00:46:45,250
very proud of the technical excellence

00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:47,260
part and what powers that again is that

00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:49,599
upstream collaboration the fact that we

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,520
work directly with all these up streams

00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,740
and that we you know again we try not to

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,480
hoard code or horde patches we try and

00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,900
work directly with with other

00:46:55,480 --> 00:47:00,520
communities our feature process allows

00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:02,349
our contributors to enter a feature if

00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,089
anybody has ownership of some code and

00:47:02,349 --> 00:47:05,500
they feel like it's worthy of going into

00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:06,970
a release they can become a part of our

00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,289
feature process that means we'll talk

00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,390
about it for the next release and and

00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:12,970
draw a lot of attention draw people to

00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:15,579
help make it better file bugs triage

00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,109
those bugs and so on so Red Hat has

00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:19,900
actually hired people on the basis of

00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:23,109
work done in fedora for those reasons

00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:24,579
and you know anybody else could too so

00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:26,170
again you know this is an open and

00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:29,799
transparent project it's a great way to

00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:33,160
build it build a resume um and lastly

00:47:29,799 --> 00:47:35,770
first we believe in innovation we're

00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:39,430
very eager in fedora to do the heavy

00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:42,250
lifting right doing heavy lifting is not

00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:44,890
always fun but it's almost always

00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:47,440
rewarding our rapid release cycle means

00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,790
that we can balance that innovation with

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,100
putting something in front of people

00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:53,410
that is incredibly useful shows off some

00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:56,080
of the best code that runs today and

00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:57,550
redhat participates in this because they

00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,550
get something out of it to essentially

00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:03,430
they can use fedora as their R&D lab for

00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:05,080
their future product line right anyone

00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:06,880
else can too that's the great thing

00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:09,400
about it right Red Hat puts in a lot of

00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,140
resources but anyone else can as well if

00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:13,060
you've got something that you'd like to

00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,950
see million in front of potentially

00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:19,360
millions of people you can do the same

00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:21,040
thing so that is basically our four

00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,920
foundations and them there are two

00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,260
silent eps that you don't see on here

00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:27,730
one of them has failed right and we we

00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:29,740
try not to make that part of this

00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,660
picture if we can avoid it right but I

00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,670
also believed in something that zonker

00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:35,200
said he and I I see eye to eye on a few

00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:38,110
things one of things he said this

00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:40,270
morning was you know just get up and do

00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:42,670
something right do something even if

00:48:40,270 --> 00:48:44,890
it's wrong and we definitely believe in

00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:47,830
that too we believe that failure is

00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:50,080
necessary to grow and it's okay to fail

00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:51,910
it's what you do with the failure that

00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:55,080
defines the projects what you do with

00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:58,210
the failure that defines you okay and

00:48:55,080 --> 00:49:00,100
you know so so something that that Greg

00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:02,170
de königsberg is back there's you know

00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:04,270
one of my one of my good buddies and and

00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:09,850
mentors when i started in fedora many

00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:13,150
years ago and has shown a lot of trust

00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:15,970
and you know in friendship to me so he

00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:18,130
he said something one once that i never

00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:21,100
forget which is the the where the sixth

00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:24,070
f the the silent foundation comes out

00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:26,110
which is faster fail faster and that's

00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:28,420
what we believe in fedora fail quickly

00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:30,160
get over it pick yourself up and try

00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,620
again and fail again if you have to and

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:36,280
keep doing it as fast as you can right

00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:38,200
and that's how you grow and that's all I

00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,250
have to say so I hope you take some of

00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,380
these lessons and can grow some

00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,150
communities of your own out there take

00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,130
them and use them with your teams and I

00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,410
hope that you have really enjoyed this

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:49,210
