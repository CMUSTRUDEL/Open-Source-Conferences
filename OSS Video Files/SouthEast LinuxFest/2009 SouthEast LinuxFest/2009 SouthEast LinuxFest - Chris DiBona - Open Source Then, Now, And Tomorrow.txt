the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,390
by view digital media at the inaugural

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,769
southeast linux fest in clemson south

00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:13,080
carolina on jun 13 2004 more information

00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:16,650
about the southeast linux fest visit

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,730
southeast linux fest org all right oh

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:23,160
yeah i'm chris i have a new blazer can

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,699
we kill the house lights up here because

00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,529
it's violet so cuz you know green is

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:33,719
very 2004 and and blue is sort of 2007

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:34,829
you know you see it okay is it making

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,440
your eyes freaked out because it's

00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,570
violet that awesome it takes like these

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,620
two cr2 batteries and in terms melting

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:42,090
them down because they have to power

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,590
requirements and if you look at it

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,110
directly entreated be blind so that's

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:51,000
that's my new laser and that that's my

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:53,219
presentation thank you for coming okay

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,039
so he mentioned this is what I do for a

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,660
living I'm not going to talk about the

00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,309
the incredibly glamorous world of

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:01,590
open-source license compliance for very

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,850
much but it's actually a very important

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,860
part of what I do I've always thought

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,420
that sort of the base behavior of a

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,400
company and open source was using

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,920
software within the boundaries of the

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,060
license because if you screw that up you

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,180
can't do anything really really fun

00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:18,259
things in open source like Android the

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,880
rest so so so we've spent a lot of time

00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:23,580
on doing that at Google and making that

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,020
easy and and a similar amount of time

00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,430
making it very easy for Googlers truly

00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,780
software and so some of what you'll see

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,159
today is the result of that see now you

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,940
can see the laser even better check it

00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,480
out

00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:38,000
alright uh and then I can talk and show

00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,210
off lasers um actually I own the laser

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,890
15 years ago that i took out of a you

00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,590
don't really care about this but i do i

00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,970
think i took it out of a laser printer

00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:49,040
and powder with this external power

00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,500
spine was like this big and I actually

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,000
took into a conference once we were like

00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,200
what the anyway um yeah so I run

00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,690
compliance released from the code from

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,400
the company Summer of Code and I've

00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,220
picked up more teams now I just released

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,970
a new project called all for good which

00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:08,570
matches up volunteering and volunteering

00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:10,670
opportunities so if you want to

00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:12,050
volunteer for anything ever you can go

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,250
to that we're doing about 10 queries per

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,260
second right now which is about a

00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,540
million page views a day which is pretty

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,940
cool hundred thousand whatever it

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,320
doesn't matter but that's all open

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,780
source too so if you want to look into

00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,739
what that site looks like you can go see

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,989
that but yeah let's continue the agenda

00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:36,170
it's very simple it's me questions

00:02:29,989 --> 00:02:37,820
that's it we know who this guy is it's

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,950
like because I gave this exact talk i

00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,150
think in malaysia and they're like and

00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,970
they'll laugh but it was like a

00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:45,920
different kind of laugh they're like

00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,870
they're like and you have to explain

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,489
well this is a noted shyster who shows

00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:53,480
up I'm late night television they all

00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:58,780
went so i guess they have their own just

00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,500
speaking Malaysian or whatever so I

00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:02,239
wanted to start with sort of talking

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,340
about where we've been for a few moments

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,040
where we are right now which is sort of

00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,170
the meat of the talk and then you know

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,060
what I think the future will bring us as

00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:12,650
part of my job we do a lot of sort of

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,870
research and it's sort of the nature

00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:16,820
open source code and we've taken the

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,320
google code search product and use that

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,090
as a corpus to do some interesting

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,160
studies about so you'll see there were

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,010
some of the results of that in that

00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,220
section but let's talk about the past a

00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:29,570
lot of people forget about this part of

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,850
open source but it really goes to the

00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,560
heart of why open source is cool and fun

00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:38,180
and interesting so on the left this is a

00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,410
ken thompson and dennis ritchie working

00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,250
on the first unix that ran on an early

00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:46,810
microcomputer that's a micro

00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:50,840
here ah you can tell because of the

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:54,320
bigness of it and and they presented

00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:56,390
their new system UNIX at a conference at

00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,410
Purdue University where a young Kirk

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:01,940
mcusic was see I using my laser ankle

00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,220
we're young Kirk mcusic was was

00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:05,959
attending he was I think a graduate

00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,610
student at the time and he thought the

00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,380
scenic stuff was pretty cool and as he

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,490
matriculated in whatever to Berkeley he

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:18,130
said well why don't we implement our own

00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:21,019
version of this and you know over time

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:22,970
he came out with the first of what we

00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,290
think it was bsd but he really got

00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,280
hooked on unix at the time he thought

00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,560
well you know if we can share these

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,970
ideas this was a bear two years after I

00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,870
was born so that should give you an idea

00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:34,160
how long ago this was you know if we can

00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:35,900
share these ideas about how we can take

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,250
computer science then we can we can move

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,630
the whole science forward we can move

00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,330
you know and it wasn't thinking about

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,340
industry or you know career or the rest

00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:44,870
so much he was thinking about you know

00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:49,130
where can we take computers and why is

00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:51,320
that awesome and and so by 77 he had a

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:52,760
good enough version everyone was using

00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,320
it it was used as the basis for the

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,930
first son's and Apollo's and HP

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,570
workstations and spawn may derivatives

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:01,520
that we think this is a bsd open source

00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:03,470
world today and and a lot of people

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,810
don't talk about bsd but it's up until

00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,390
about two thousand two it had pretty

00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:11,540
much parity from a deployment standpoint

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:13,700
on the internet and and only when

00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,310
multi-core multi cpu processors came out

00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:20,060
to the linux really start to outperform

00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:21,800
bsd in some situations and it still has

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,540
a remarkable amount of market share on

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:25,490
the internet and and and and people

00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:27,770
ignore it and don't talk about it and

00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,820
don't see how great it is and and it's

00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,280
always surprising me because it also

00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:34,280
it's the ethics behind bsd that that we

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:38,720
all identify with an open source yes

00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:40,280
anyways sometime later sendmail formerly

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,620
called the liver which was used to

00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,030
basically move around host files among

00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,919
the early unix machines at berkeley

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,919
turned into send mail and it started

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:53,030
evolving to send mail email as we know

00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:55,350
it that's Eric with his beer um places

00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:58,620
the past he drinks wine morning

00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:00,660
and an around 83 as you know the free

00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,410
software foundation was formed and the

00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,300
GPL codified Richards ideals behind his

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,060
thinking around free software and we

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,710
have to realize is the ideals behind bsd

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,030
and send mail and the Free Software

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:13,140
Foundation is really what we're talking

00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:14,730
about when we talk about open source

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,470
it's really what we're talking about

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,480
when we talk about licenses if you

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:21,510
understand the ideals and the genesis of

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,250
these people and these projects you have

00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:26,190
a really good feel for what they expect

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,220
of you when you use them so that's

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:30,900
pretty awesome like I said a lot of a

00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,210
lot of you know all this stuff so I know

00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,960
this is review but especially they got

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:38,580
the Red Hat probably knows this but you

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,380
know 93 redhead started you know Mark

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,610
Ewing and and Bob Young sort of got

00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,870
together they flooded a couple of

00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:45,060
apartments with Donnie Barnes and they

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:47,190
launched red hat and no seriously that's

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,170
the you know the story about the toilets

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,100
overflowing and I think I kicked out of

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,430
their apartment cuz they're running a

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,440
business there and yeah anyway and at

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,260
the same time intronic which PMV a Linux

00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,270
which became Balon research which became

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,220
whatever until sourceforge and the first

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:04,230
official release of bsd as we think

00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,730
about it today freebsd came out them and

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:09,120
so there's a lot of exciting things

00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:11,100
going on but then the internet hit right

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,120
so up until you know 94 a lot of people

00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,250
thought of the internet is being this

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,360
academic thing a way of sharing gopher

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,640
and archie and IRC and and just op's

00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,430
stuff and and and people started to use

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,330
a free meal but not strongly the way

00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:30,530
that we do now and then the webcam and

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:33,360
the web was awesome right and an ncsa

00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:34,680
sort of release the code in something

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,600
called shambhala which became apache

00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:39,300
which we all know now and has about

00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,610
65-70 percent of all the websites in the

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,460
world running on right and again apache

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,430
also became a licensing philosophy a lot

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,410
like BS state take the code enjoy it use

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,670
it you don't have to share back but just

00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,100
let people know that you used some

00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,870
Apache go you know very simple sharing

00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,280
and these ideals they just keep them

00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,420
coming up and up and up and if you look

00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,100
at them they're very very simple you

00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,410
have the people who want you to share if

00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,700
you use their code the other people who

00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,320
don't really care if you share are not

00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:06,240
so long as you know let people know that

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,650
you're using their code and there's a

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,520
little bit in between but this is sort

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,039
of slumpy

00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,210
and it's all keyed on distribution so if

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,889
you don't ship it out they don't really

00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:17,190
care what you do with their code any of

00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:20,129
these people and and that's where we are

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:24,870
now so there's a lot of code on the

00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:28,680
internet we counted it all I had an

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:30,960
intern do it no I know I had computers

00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:35,430
we google has a lot of computers get

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,409
like 15 16 computers now and so anyway

00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:39,419
so we looked across all the cub and we

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,500
broke down by license you know this is

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,880
literally billions of lines of code

00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,890
right and and when you look at the

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,950
licenses you see about forty-eight

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:53,430
forty-nine percent GPL about 23% lgpl

00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,050
and then permissive licensing pretty

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,230
much encompasses the rest with some odd

00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:59,910
ducks here and there it freaking the

00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:03,029
NPLs and the rest over and that sort of

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:04,260
call out over there I once gave a

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:05,880
presentation where literally the

00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,589
projector stopped working at this point

00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:10,399
so I was describing a pie chart it was

00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:14,370
kind of it was pretty interesting um

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,350
yeah so but the point of this the slide

00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,110
is you know some people are afraid of

00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,690
the GPL and even the lgpl i given this

00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,070
talk at defense contractors and others

00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,510
and there they go we're very afraid of

00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:27,180
blah blah blah and I'm like well then

00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,529
just stay over here you know no one's

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,610
going to be sad if you stay over here

00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,290
and you won't be either because all the

00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,579
things we found at Google especially we

00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,440
were creating Android and our our

00:09:32,579 --> 00:09:35,670
guiding philosophy around licenses and

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,649
Android versus to stick with Apache

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,050
whenever possible and BSU whenever

00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:42,240
possible if you found a library under

00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:45,870
the GPL lgpl you could often find it or

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,690
an equivalent in in bsd and apache lands

00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:50,940
so if your politics goes more towards

00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:53,370
the permissive licenses the way that the

00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,320
way that that ours does you can usually

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,790
find what you need and remember you know

00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,100
this this is sort of a funny slide

00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:00,720
because it's a pie chart right and so it

00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,579
d emphasizes the scale of things you

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,770
know this is this is 500 million lines

00:10:02,579 --> 00:10:06,779
of code we figure maybe even more and

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,700
we'll have an exact number a toscana

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,410
later in the year but I mean you know

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,240
500 lines of code is a staggering amount

00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,790
of development you know a really solid

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,459
developer they say could create you know

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:21,029
a thousand lines of code in and say a

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:21,370
week right and so if you're good at

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,490
using

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:28,089
this kind of code you're like 5,000

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:31,570
developers right or like no 5 million

00:10:28,089 --> 00:10:33,610
developers so you know for a given week

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,380
all right and that's a staggering and

00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:36,850
crazy and insane if you're if because I

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:38,320
crappy developers lot of us doing a

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:41,830
hundred lines of code solid co2 week

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,870
right so so there's this incredible

00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,160
amount of functionality out there so and

00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,620
you know Google to give you an idea we

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:51,310
have probably but eight thousand people

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,930
who code every day right so poof any one

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:55,839
of you can be bigger than the entire

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,400
technical staff at Google right and now

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,820
the reality is we were happy to use this

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:03,970
code to at Google so so so good luck

00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:05,050
with that but but seriously you know if

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,310
you're thinking about a soccer

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:08,260
development organizations most of them

00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:09,820
are quite small right so if you can just

00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:11,440
become good at using the code that's out

00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,060
there you can bring an incredible amount

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,980
of productivity into your company into

00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,570
your hobby into your fun right and

00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,100
that's pretty awesome and I'm stepping

00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,740
on someone's laptop sorry about that

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,270
who's always powerbook is down there I

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:28,660
was like wow that's giving a lot what's

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:30,010
I didn't break it I don't think

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,430
otherwise i guess i'm buying a laptop

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:35,680
for somebody and it so at the same time

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:37,540
right now worried about actually i don't

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,910
know if that top number is true i really

00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,870
need to update it and recheck it but

00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,100
right now about thirty percent of the

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,930
Internet's running linux but similar

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,950
amounts running bsd there's probably a

00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:51,339
little more linux now than BST by some

00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:55,450
amount bsd is and forgive the reference

00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:57,220
BST is loved by the porn business and no

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,610
no seriously i'm not you know it's just

00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:03,070
it's a fact and so you see a lot of

00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:06,930
over-representation of bsd in that very

00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:09,070
popular segment of the internet and then

00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:11,200
linux is deceptive though because people

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,420
say well you know we don't know what's

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,279
behind the firewall at yahoo yeah we do

00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,700
it's linux for the most part and a bunch

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,750
of BS d about half and half there until

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,130
we really don't know what's behind the

00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,839
firewall google is they can we do it's

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,920
it's linux like every single time you're

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,279
using google you're using linux

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,910
everybody every single time so you know

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,500
so and and like you know they have this

00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:34,230
noted story where they're like you know

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,810
it's less apache because of google

00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:38,400
like what are you talking about that's

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,540
ridiculous you know first of all we're

00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,560
not five percent of the internet so I

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,180
don't see how you can justify taking

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,000
five percent off the top for Apache but

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:48,450
anyway um and we actually use apache

00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,090
like crazy at YouTube so anyway so

00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:52,830
that's that's operating systems other

00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,910
internet stuff you see about ninety

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,380
percent in ninety-eight percent of all

00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:57,330
dns and bind is still going through open

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,360
source software you know basically it is

00:12:57,330 --> 00:13:01,860
logical to say that when you're using

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:04,670
the internet you're using open source

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:08,040
all the time for pretty much everything

00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,050
unless you hang out on microsoft live a

00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,370
lot but even that you know that they

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,560
recently bought power set which runs

00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,060
linux which i don't know might stick in

00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,940
there crawl a little bit but I mean it's

00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:20,190
just how it is right so it's pretty

00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,380
exciting you know it's a pretty exciting

00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:27,000
world for open source and it's not just

00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,260
internet serving as you know this is the

00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,510
stuff I know you guys already know this

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,500
but I said anyway you know it's

00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,480
everything it's kind of management

00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,640
systems it's PBXs as you heard from mark

00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,600
spencer earlier it's it's games as you

00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,280
might have heard from Ryan I know

00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,200
friends in the room i mean it's it's

00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,970
everything you know if you can think of

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,890
something there's somebody in the open

00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:46,020
source world is enthusiastic about it if

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,860
you go back you know 10 years he's to

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,140
give these interviews and they're like

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,330
yeah you know maybe people like it for

00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,010
the odd the odd website but they'll

00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,960
never use it for file servers like you

00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:56,790
know Sam is used a lot no well merely

00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,760
using it for file servers but it's not

00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,350
real computer science or anything like

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,580
what about the CDA stuff over this over

00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:04,140
there like well yeah but they never use

00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,370
it for business applications and you're

00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,780
like what about the serum crap and

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,770
they're like all right just get on my

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,450
office and and and you know people would

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,220
like plant these stories about how linux

00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,440
wasn't serious how it sucked i was

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,360
insecure and it's like you know I are

00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,370
you even paying attention and the

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,630
reality is you know the war metaphor the

00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,520
fight people love to write about the

00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:26,940
fight because it's exciting and tries

00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:28,650
page views and anyway but um but yet

00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,150
it's all out there and it's all out

00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,470
there under a variety of licenses

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:33,930
there's so much open source code that

00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,700
you know whatever your ideals around

00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:37,620
sharing are you can usually find

00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:41,640
something that works with you and that's

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:42,930
pretty awesome so yeah so that's good so

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:45,960
that's where we are right now if you

00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,690
have an iphone if you have an ipod if

00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,670
you have a digital camera if you have

00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,080
bluetooth headset you know as likely as

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:55,310
not everything in there was written

00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:56,390
using GCC you know I went to again that

00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,070
defense contractor and they said well

00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:59,690
you know we don't use any open source so

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,010
we're cool you know we just want to

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,390
learn about it and I'm like okay and

00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,950
then by the time I got there to give the

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,970
speech I was like hey I want to

00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,050
congratulate you on your open source

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,520
adoption they're like what are you

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:08,870
talking about and I'm like oh well

00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,040
you're using it here here here and and

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,080
the following products couldn't ship

00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,790
without it they like really and I'm like

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,230
yeah really you know you don't think you

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,870
actually bought a new compiler for that

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,290
did you and you're using GCC and they're

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:23,060
like but but but it's like yeah you know

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,320
and they're like but we don't use except

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,240
for our website or anything and I'm like

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,700
it well yeah you know your son one web

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,210
servers uses openssl and they're like

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,340
really like yeah really you know I met

00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:35,570
you'll be dumb not to you know why do i

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,040
do you want to adopt something that you

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:38,630
know is going to be insecure i mean why

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,550
don't you go with openssl so we already

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,830
know how it's been hacked you know I

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,230
know like oh yeah that makes sense when

00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:46,340
that was a fun talk to give obviously

00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,040
it's used everywhere on the internet

00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,810
right this is y and X by the way the

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,850
first time I gave this was in was in

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:56,180
Russia so I threw in a Russian search

00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:58,100
engine to be all cool like that and like

00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:59,540
literally I had to like get this

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,370
properly translated they're like oh

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:03,620
we're using this diacritical mark wrong

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:06,440
all right you know but yeah this is

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:09,020
beyond decks just if you were going to

00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:11,630
Russia I have my name in in Russian to

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,960
somewhere not on this talk not that you

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,010
care that's where we are today so so

00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:20,390
here's what I talked about Google and

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:23,600
how awesome we are now I won't bore you

00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:24,740
with that too much but I will so we use

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,750
open source like I said every time you

00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,540
go to Google you're using Linux every

00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:30,800
single time our software engineering

00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,750
desktops you know about half of them

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,380
running Linux we're running a basically

00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:38,950
a version of a bun to that ties into our

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:42,320
file servers and stuff we like it a lot

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:44,720
all of our build tools linkers compilers

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,700
debuggers languages and literally

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,550
hundreds probably actually realistically

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,770
thousands of libraries at this point and

00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:55,580
then we used to not run it much Apache I

00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:59,839
just got electrocuted by my laser it's

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:01,410
it's a sample you know Louise yep not

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,779
use much in the way of Apache

00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:04,919
but as we've been doing acquisitions as

00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:07,380
a company especially largely like

00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,510
YouTube with with lots of installed base

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:11,819
we've learned to start using it well

00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,720
before we do is we would buy a company

00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:14,640
we deport them over to our

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,409
infrastructure because that skills very

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,110
very well and is very monitor roble by

00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:21,120
us so but yeah so use a fair amount of

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,449
Apache web servers now that used to not

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,400
be the case and then we release a lot of

00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,740
software we patch into hundreds of

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,360
projects every month I'm very proud of

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,880
this we try to keep it very low touch

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,260
from an oversight perspective so it's

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,900
hard to give you an exact number four

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,030
patches but yeah we're all over the

00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,880
place and it's and it's good you know

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:43,830
because if you look at especially hiring

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,480
for teams like their colonel team our

00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,159
compiler team knowing that they can

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,320
patch out is very very important to them

00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:50,730
and it's important to me personally but

00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:54,330
it's nice that we're able as a company

00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:56,150
to do that we released a number of small

00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:59,940
projects about one a week right now

00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,919
about 300 of them and that's not

00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,409
counting API examples which would add

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,200
that a couple hundred and those are

00:18:04,409 --> 00:18:08,460
everything from small dev tools whether

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,320
it's like the first things we released

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,549
our memory allocation routines are

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,140
threading libraries and that kind of

00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:19,409
thing to full linkers you know it's very

00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:21,480
targeted at developers so that's a good

00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:25,320
thing you know we released our my sequel

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:27,960
replication patches around 4x my sequel

00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:29,730
which was very popular and we were very

00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,820
proud of that actually because my single

00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,590
kind of didn't want them because they're

00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:36,179
already on the fives and so they're like

00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,280
yeah we don't care like okay so we

00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:40,830
really see it anyway and and it found

00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,210
this great community of users and who

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,299
then wanted to buy support from my

00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:48,720
sequel which is pretty funny and they're

00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,370
like you know they're like that doesn't

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,720
seem like it's for version 5 and they're

00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:55,770
like no it's not but we used ford it and

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:58,799
they're like okay it was a bit of drama

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:00,750
that was pretty funny at the time so

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,419
yeah so this is the day-to-day patching

00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:05,250
that is is sort of like this is the

00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,260
fundamental this is the infrastructure

00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,520
this is the the greasing of the wheels

00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,440
of the open-source process that's

00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:12,030
actually really really important because

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,830
the problem with very large companies

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,790
that aren't like red hat that are open

00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,300
source from the core

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,350
you know is that you get really sorry

00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:23,880
about the laptop again I'm just going to

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,110
move this there you go harder to step on

00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,100
now oh it's not a macbook it's like

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:32,130
Adele I'm sure it'll be fine um but it's

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:35,370
silvery you see that's branding for you

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,110
um so where was I yeah so in large

00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:39,810
companies you know we can we can become

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,010
very inwardly focused and unless you

00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,840
start a project with the idea it's gonna

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,070
be open source from the get-go it can be

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,020
hard to open source of because it'll be

00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,420
tied into a lot of systems that you

00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,920
haven't opened yet or maybe aren't well

00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:53,310
suited to opening depending on your

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,540
perspective and so having like constant

00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,730
release going on all the time has been

00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:58,500
an important part of what we do and so

00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,000
if you go to the open source prog just

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,260
you know every other post is we release

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,940
the little thing here go check it out

00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:04,080
and we actually don't blog much about

00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,480
the patching but that's really really

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,040
important at letting Google engineers

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,500
feel that they you know can just submit

00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:12,330
a bug submit a patch after a trivial

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,870
first review they're not insane is

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,760
pretty great um so yeah but then we have

00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:19,620
these big projects right and the first

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,450
really big project and by big I mean

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:23,460
usually generally larger than say five

00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:26,340
hundred thousand lines of code you know

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:29,280
with a greater strategic impact and that

00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,540
kind of thing so you know one of the

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:33,630
problems we had earlier on how many of

00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:35,250
you program websites for a living you

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:37,170
know and so how many of you have wanted

00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:42,240
to kill yourself over that last edit for

00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:44,460
ie6 or Safari or Chrome or whatever

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,930
right often you'll find that there's

00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,880
like you have to tweak it just a little

00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:51,030
bit to make it work with that last

00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:52,530
browser and we have that problem all the

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:54,420
time at Google as you might imagine you

00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:58,950
know we try to go for these lively Ajax

00:20:54,420 --> 00:21:01,380
II interfaces which means pain and so an

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,380
enterprising group in Atlanta another of

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,850
your southern brethren decided they

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,220
wanted to attack this problem head-on

00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:09,990
and actually via java which was

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:11,580
interesting so we have three primary

00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,160
languages at Google Java C++ and Python

00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:17,280
and so the idea that you could basically

00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,710
use your regular clip sort of IDEs to

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,650
develop web interfaces that didn't suck

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:25,290
and didn't look like swing was pretty

00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:27,230
cool right and so you know we released

00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:29,480
this release the

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:32,210
this was almost four years ago now maybe

00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,140
three and a half and it's one of those

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:35,179
things were asked to admit when I heard

00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,040
about it and we were working with them

00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:39,260
to maintain licenses I was like is this

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,169
really going to be used much I mean you

00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:45,380
know it's Java and you know it's Java

00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:47,330
you know and and so and we've always

00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:49,340
been very consumer focused and consumers

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,620
didn't like Java you know that kind of

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:53,210
thing and and I was shocked and how much

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,850
people downloaded this and what we found

00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:57,380
was it wasn't the typical sort of from

00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:59,450
the hip hacker who was downloading it

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:01,190
but but it had this popularity behind

00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:04,040
the firewalls and large organizations

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,299
that was shocking and probably shouldn't

00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,299
have been shocking if I could remember

00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:11,570
my days back when I was you know living

00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:14,120
in the eighth sub-basement of a law firm

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,440
doing computer work there right I'm not

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,790
kidding actually had to drive down seven

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,960
floors and then go down a little to get

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:23,270
to my office but like yeah that was

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,780
painful and there was carbon monoxide

00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:28,250
detectors everywhere no seriously they

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:30,220
didn't want to give us above ground

00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:33,049
offices because they were too expensive

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,760
and so they converted the bottom most

00:22:33,049 --> 00:22:37,100
floor of the parking garage this is in

00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:41,780
Washington DC so we're also under the

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:43,370
water table too so it was awesome anyway

00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,809
so yeah I felt like you know whenever I

00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,190
heard about Dick Cheney going to his

00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:51,860
secret undisclosed location I'm like he

00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:52,669
could use my old office anyway so I

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,500
don't know where I was going with that

00:22:52,669 --> 00:22:55,970
but but yeah we had client-server things

00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,559
that were just appallingly terrible to

00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:59,720
work with and and in a lot of ways the

00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,220
web saved people from that but they

00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:03,770
still didn't have the liveliness and the

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,600
desktop sort of metaphors that they

00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:07,429
could rely on and and so there's a lot

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,500
of clicking of submit buttons on forms

00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:11,210
and and it's helped with that and so I

00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:14,000
think it found like this natural home

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:15,500
with literally millions of people who

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,960
are developing using and it was it was

00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:19,160
very rewarding to release and and act

00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,140
admit you know sometimes we release

00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,400
things I think you just terrible you

00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,410
know I'm like or it's not the kind of

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,059
thing that I'd be excited by and and

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,220
often i'm wrong and that's always really

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,660
great to see and it kind of goes back to

00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,030
there's open source for everything it

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,000
turns out people are driven by all kinds

00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:36,919
of problems that are really really cool

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,090
once you get into them right and and

00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,029
maybe some kind of thing that you

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,289
personally would think is cool

00:23:40,029 --> 00:23:42,999
it's actually an engaging technical

00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:45,219
problem and so this is one of those

00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:47,289
things where that happen and then we're

00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:48,940
like well web browsers aren't fast

00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,499
enough how can we make them faster we

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,479
tried a couple of ways of going about

00:23:50,499 --> 00:23:53,619
this with the established providers and

00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:57,009
we finally decided what we really need

00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:59,769
is a new JavaScript interpreter and so a

00:23:57,009 --> 00:24:02,590
virtual machine and so we wrote one we

00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:07,149
had some folks in very northern climes

00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:09,249
in Scandinavia and and we also wanted to

00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:12,070
bring new features that were being

00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:15,129
supported by html5 into modern browsers

00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:16,749
so so so that we could give people those

00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:17,739
desktop like environments and now we

00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:18,849
could have stopped there and said you

00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:19,989
know we don't need to open source this

00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:22,349
we can just keep it closed or whatever

00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:24,460
which would have been stupid by the way

00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:26,529
especially considering you know the open

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,109
nature of Firefox and folks like that

00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:30,639
but we decided in the end that you know

00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:31,839
what we wanted was to release this so

00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:33,820
that if other people decided that what

00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:36,879
we had done was good that they could

00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:39,999
have you know either adopted some of the

00:24:36,879 --> 00:24:42,940
vm technology we use in v8 which is the

00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:44,229
javascript render or they could steal

00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,509
other components they might find useful

00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:48,369
to make their web browsers better but

00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:50,710
basically Google depends on awesome web

00:24:48,369 --> 00:24:53,019
browsers continuing and frankly being

00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:54,609
competitive with each other right anyone

00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:58,210
browser dominating the market is very

00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:59,379
very bad for google + + IE you know give

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,190
you an example Microsoft turns out they

00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:06,129
don't like us very much and and so so

00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:09,219
with Firefox doing so well and we're

00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:11,830
very excited by that and Firefox is a

00:25:09,219 --> 00:25:13,690
terrific competitor against IE and and

00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,399
and and yet there are some places where

00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:17,440
firefox just doesn't exist you know

00:25:15,399 --> 00:25:19,419
there are parts of asia and like why is

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,190
that what's going on in and a lot of

00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,749
times it came down to speed and it came

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:24,399
down to other factors that probably

00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:25,719
firefox wasn't prioritizing in our

00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:27,159
opinion so we're like well maybe we can

00:25:25,719 --> 00:25:29,320
prioritize it and see if we're right and

00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:31,570
some cases we were in most cases we

00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,129
weren't and you know but still we

00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,019
managed to get out this really high

00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:36,999
performing browser that can do exciting

00:25:35,019 --> 00:25:38,979
things so that was really really very

00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:41,169
rewarding and this is this is out this

00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:43,059
is open-source mostly bsd actually along

00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:44,679
with the patent on assert so the reason

00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:46,479
why we usually use apache by the way is

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,549
that this really terrific patent

00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:50,710
language it says to you the developer

00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,119
the user we say listen you know you can

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,290
have this code but we're not just giving

00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:55,270
you the code

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:59,020
we're giving you any patents we might

00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:00,910
own as well for you to use and for you

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,440
to pass on to your users and so when we

00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,240
release things under BST which doesn't

00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:05,410
have those patent clauses we add them

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,330
after the fact we put them in the

00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:08,590
documentation we say listen you're also

00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:10,480
getting a patent on assert with these

00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:13,150
because we firmly believe in a defensive

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,280
patent posture we we actually believe we

00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,740
really need them because of the way

00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:18,640
patents work in the United States but we

00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,560
want to make it really clear to

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,550
developers and to the people who use our

00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,200
products that we're not using them

00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,880
against down alright we're using them

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,860
really for protective purposes and

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,330
that's why we mostly use apache and when

00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,940
you see other licenses we have the

00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:32,620
patent on asserts thing so let's keep

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,360
going and then we had android so Android

00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:39,720
how many who have ever had to develop

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:44,290
for non android open net android phones

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:47,140
like symbian or something yeah it was

00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:52,810
done in java j2me so was that would you

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:53,950
say it was fun yeah so so sometimes i

00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,150
give this talk to a lot of like mobile

00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,940
developers and they're just like they're

00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,440
so overjoyed by how easy it is to

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:00,970
develop both for the iphone but also for

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,540
the android that they're just like wow

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,820
thank God you know and and what's funny

00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:08,410
about it is you know if you looked at

00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,180
cell phones three and a half years ago

00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:11,890
when we started the Android project well

00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:17,200
it starts a strong word I don't get to

00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:19,030
why you know Nokia Symbian had about 75

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,920
percent of the market when is mobile had

00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:22,510
about twenty percent and there was

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,220
everyone else like little Chinese

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:29,170
operating systems that you'll find on on

00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:30,160
fake o phones in Shenzhen and buy fake

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,960
oh I me like they're pretending their

00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,540
iPhones they're pretending area but

00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:36,840
there's also real cell phones as well

00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:38,710
and there's there's actually a lot of

00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:40,060
cell phone operating systems out there

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,400
you know there's like Sony Ericsson

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,290
favors one I mean yeah there were a

00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,430
couple of Linux phones as well in China

00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:49,660
but they never shipped out of China

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:51,940
because of well I don't go there and and

00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,170
so we thought you know what the world we

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,430
think what the world needs when you

00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:56,130
consider the advance of the arm

00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,240
platforms out there how

00:27:56,130 --> 00:28:00,340
performance-oriented they are how fast

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,810
they are how wonderful they are and how

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,640
much capacity they have is we need a

00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:05,890
really good smartphone operating system

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,680
that anyone can adopt whether they like

00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:09,080
us or not and that

00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,220
means open source and so we started we

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,170
started thinking about this especially

00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,760
considering the competitive picture we

00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,110
wanted cell phones be more like the

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,250
internet where everyone can compete

00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:19,400
everyone compete against each other

00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,070
everyone can get to everybody you know

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:24,050
you you know if you don't like Google

00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:26,510
which by the way I hope you do but if

00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:28,640
you don't you can go to yahoo you can go

00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,080
to Microsoft Live you can go to I'll

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,700
took this time sure they're still in

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,440
business right now they probably are

00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,200
right i mean so if you want to do that

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,760
nothing we can do will change that I

00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,350
mean besides the fact that we don't want

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,540
to there's nothing we can do to change

00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,920
that right and if you think of what can

00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:45,260
keep people from that kind of

00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:48,110
competitiveness you know it's its

00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,910
dominant market dominance right this is

00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:51,590
why firefox and so important this is why

00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,800
multiple browsers are so important this

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,210
is why the desktop space is so crappy

00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,890
right you know a lot of people feel that

00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:00,350
the internet wouldn't have grown if the

00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,850
desktop hadn't been so terrible if it

00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:03,800
hadn't been locked in by one company

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,950
that was going to take everything from

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:09,020
it anyway so so you see the cell phone

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:12,530
marketing you think you know what what

00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:14,750
we see is two dominant commercial

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:17,360
players who don't have a good history of

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,490
working with people right and so how can

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,350
we fix that right well let's release it

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,540
open source now let's release it under

00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:26,870
the apache license for the most part as

00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:28,430
a GPL linux kernel which is great and

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:32,450
the idea is that when we get somebody a

00:29:28,430 --> 00:29:34,340
new minimum bar right you know so even

00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:36,110
if you don't want to talk to us and make

00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,060
it like a Google Experience phone you

00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:41,810
can still ship a pretty amazing phone

00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:43,490
you know and and and we just took for

00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,320
those of you who care about the money we

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,880
stood eight to fifteen dollars to twenty

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,230
dollars if you're on the high end of

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,000
some of the commercial operating systems

00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:53,420
off the bill of materials for these

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,670
phones and that's quite significant for

00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,960
some of them for actually most of the

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:00,110
smartphones it's a very significant

00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,420
savings and we've helped drive maybe an

00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:05,750
open-source strategy for Sydney alright

00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:08,060
so that's pretty exciting stuff and and

00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:10,640
it's a lot of open source code you know

00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:12,560
and it's all pretty good it's all pretty

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,020
tailored to the embedded and phone

00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:16,790
market right because unfortunately one

00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,700
of the things that's kept open source

00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,269
from happening on phones is that it was

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,859
made

00:30:20,269 --> 00:30:24,559
for large memory environments it was

00:30:21,859 --> 00:30:26,599
made for environments had a lot of disk

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,009
space and all the rounds and where you

00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:29,539
can get away with certain things like

00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:30,799
for instance all of our

00:30:29,539 --> 00:30:33,289
internationalization is in the framework

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,879
layer and so we couldn't really use G

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:37,399
lib sees meg and a half of

00:30:34,879 --> 00:30:40,940
internationalisation right and meg and a

00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:42,889
half of the space on here is significant

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:45,049
right especially when you think of

00:30:42,889 --> 00:30:47,539
phones that are less expensive then the

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:48,919
smart phones out there so we wanted to

00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:51,080
create something that could create that

00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:52,789
kind of environment and also we wanted

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,529
to make it really fun to develop for and

00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:56,329
so we ended up going instead of with

00:30:54,529 --> 00:30:58,219
pure Java know the different kind of

00:30:56,329 --> 00:30:59,570
virtual machine that allows for multiple

00:30:58,219 --> 00:31:01,429
you know applications do cool things

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,719
together you can go learn more about it

00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:03,859
later and I and it was also awesome

00:31:02,719 --> 00:31:06,079
because we got to release about 10

00:31:03,859 --> 00:31:09,169
million lines of code so that was pretty

00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:11,209
great and then we think okay so that's

00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:12,229
where we are today we've released a lot

00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:14,629
of code about 20 million lines of code

00:31:12,229 --> 00:31:16,279
across all the projects and then what's

00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:18,950
coming up next so we announced google

00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:20,869
wave at Google i/o recently it's it's

00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,489
our rethinking of communications and

00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:23,749
what we've released to date has only

00:31:22,489 --> 00:31:26,089
been protocols it hasn't been source

00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:28,039
code we are going to open source it

00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:30,169
which is is is cold comfort if you want

00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:31,639
to see the code now but if you think

00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:33,440
about it what's the point in bringing

00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:37,279
out yet another communication system

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:40,579
that only one company's things work with

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,859
right and so what we're trying to do is

00:31:40,579 --> 00:31:44,479
we're trying to create a really cool way

00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:46,039
of communicating and it's sort of like

00:31:44,479 --> 00:31:47,809
emerging if instant messaging emailing

00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:48,919
blogging and every other buzzword you

00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:53,509
might think of but it's actually really

00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:56,959
neat and not lame and and it'll crash

00:31:53,509 --> 00:31:59,450
your browser and that's that means you

00:31:56,959 --> 00:32:01,879
know all those buzzwords and then and

00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,219
then we want to find out a way of doing

00:32:01,879 --> 00:32:06,229
a fair kind of Federation so that you

00:32:04,219 --> 00:32:07,729
know you could have you know google wave

00:32:06,229 --> 00:32:09,019
but you could have you know your

00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:12,889
favorite is P wave you could have your

00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:14,869
personal wave or whatever right and and

00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:16,549
have those interact with each other in a

00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:17,839
fair way well also trying to prevent

00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:21,200
spam which is actually the hard part it

00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,419
turns out both federating and fighting

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,279
abuse is they're orthogonal to each

00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:30,079
other almost and so so and so when you

00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,579
have products like this they're started

00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,980
from scratch their brand new whether

00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:34,970
it's chromium Android wave you can you

00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,559
target open source from the very

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:41,179
beginning that's very appealing to me

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:43,400
and so now we go into the future right

00:32:41,179 --> 00:32:49,000
this is about you really write that last

00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:50,840
part was about me this is about you so

00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:53,960
how much more code we're going to be

00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,340
looking at so right now we're just a

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,320
little above three billion lines of

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,290
unique code and about six and a half

00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:02,630
billion uses of those lines of code

00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:04,730
right so every line of code on the

00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,990
internets used about twice a sort of

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,750
long and short of it some are used an

00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:10,100
appalling amount like for instance right

00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:12,679
now the most used project that we can

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,299
detect is probably go script there's

00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:16,490
like one file in there I guess every

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,990
like open source project wanted to use

00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,700
at some point we're still trying to

00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,950
verify that so don't quote me on that

00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,720
but you know there's some appallingly

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:26,690
popular projects and then there's some

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,700
see no use at all right but on average

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:30,350
every line of code on the internet is

00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,970
used at least twice now those are

00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:35,419
considered open source we've classified

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,070
the microrna license we think by 2015

00:33:35,419 --> 00:33:39,770
will be about 2 million self-identified

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,179
open source developers and and this is

00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,169
these numbers are brought together and

00:33:41,179 --> 00:33:43,790
sort of the actually the Red Hat way so

00:33:42,169 --> 00:33:46,370
you don't know this but Bob young and I

00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,590
sat in a bar once and we estimated how

00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:49,760
many people were using Linux right and

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:51,710
we took the links counter and we

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,440
multiplied it by the number of downloads

00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:57,200
at Red Hat times you know the the

00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,090
Planck's constant and and how many beers

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,980
we had that day we divided by that and

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:03,740
and and we came up with that number that

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:07,100
was used earlier red hat by the way and

00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:09,109
it was it was largely accurate we used a

00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:11,149
lot of real numbers to make a kind of a

00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:12,859
fake number but you know any that's

00:34:11,149 --> 00:34:16,220
really all you got sometimes right and

00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:17,810
and so if you look at open source right

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,060
now there's a couple of hard numbers

00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,970
right and that's the number of projects

00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:25,970
like registrated sourceforge and at code

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:28,879
google com and and we have about 250,000

00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:30,440
projects registered but aren't active

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:32,300
right so with no we think Oh what what

00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,190
is active means so if you look at the

00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,940
number of seven day active projects

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,350
today it's only about 70 or 80,000 and

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,330
we think in about five years you know we

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:43,730
could have three times as many if you

00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:46,850
look the number of non unique you know

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:47,160
crossover projects and and this is this

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,540
is

00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,450
if I'm going off on a limb here right

00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:53,460
and we think that of the registered

00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,990
developers on the two sites you know

00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,620
each one probably is greater than

00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:00,690
million users but realistically how many

00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:01,980
were actually human beings how many of

00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,000
them are not the same account how many

00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,100
them are not fitted out accounts

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,560
whatever you know again that seven-day

00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,760
active problem so I actually think the

00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,020
number of open source developers people

00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:12,630
who have literally written a line of

00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,540
code and released it by 2015 will

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:16,830
probably about 400,000 and that and

00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:18,930
that'll be actually probably more of an

00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:21,030
effect of some of the interfaces you're

00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:25,290
seeing out there that just by virtue of

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:27,570
using them you create code and with your

00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:30,210
help maybe even more and and it's funny

00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:33,060
because there's a lot of BS numbers in

00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:34,740
computer science like I once heard this

00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,110
is like in 1998 that there were three

00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:41,000
million visual basic developers when it

00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:43,710
was clearly not the case you know but

00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,730
but I think that this is a pretty good

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,580
number because it's actually growing

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:49,650
right and and and and it's finally

00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,350
growing because there was a time between

00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:55,860
like 98 and 2003 where I wasn't seeing

00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,720
anyone knew at conferences like this old

00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,030
hands and open-source know those right

00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:02,280
and we're finally seeing new people and

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:03,540
I wish I could take credit for it from

00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,030
the Summer of Code maybe that's part of

00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,870
it but you know were you a Summer of

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:14,490
Code student awesome see that's great

00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:15,780
good to me so you know but it is finally

00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:17,310
growing and that's really good and

00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,230
there's I have a lot of thoughts as to

00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,540
why it so but there's always so much you

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:24,630
want to hear me a more about so let's

00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:27,750
get to you it's all about you it's about

00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:30,360
your coat your patches your projects in

00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:33,240
your work whether its documentation or

00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:35,640
websites or whatever you can find to do

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:40,170
for these projects that have really

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:43,170
enriched us all and and and so all I

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:45,240
asked is that you you help and so if you

00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:47,160
help I promise I will too and that's

00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,540
that's all I can basically say and I'm

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:51,660
happy to take any questions until you're

00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,440
blue in the face so or until 10 minutes

00:36:51,660 --> 00:37:10,530
from now

00:36:52,440 --> 00:37:12,000
so yeah so the first hunks of code so

00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:13,890
what's funny about Google web toolkit is

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,089
it was ninety-five percent open source

00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:16,079
and there was a small hunk that wasn't

00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,510
released in the beginning and then it

00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,310
was really sick six months later and

00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:21,930
Android we announced like eight months

00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,700
ahead of time and always makes me

00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:28,079
nervous when we do that but so the first

00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,510
real code right is coming out I think in

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,640
in July if you go on the wave protocol

00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,589
discussion list we've been talking about

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,349
it there and the first piece of code is

00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:40,470
actually a sinking tool for sinking

00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:41,609
waves and particles across servers so

00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:43,589
that'll give you something to start

00:37:41,609 --> 00:37:45,089
experimenting one because like for

00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:46,260
instance miguel de icaza and some other

00:37:45,089 --> 00:37:48,540
people have already started implementing

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,250
the wave protocol and different products

00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,930
which is really shocking to us we're

00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:55,170
like oh my gosh already really no no

00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:57,329
wait stop you know but but those guys

00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,790
are used to working with draft specs

00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:01,800
they know that it's going to change so

00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:03,510
read the protocol documentation get on

00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,890
the list and you can either wait for the

00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:06,660
sinker to come out or you can just go

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:10,140
hop over to Miguel's project I'm sure it

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:12,150
will be in c-sharp and and go and go

00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,829
help out there you know and see if

00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,500
that's appealing to you you know that's

00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:17,760
what i would do you know so because

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,770
we're going to bring it out as soon as

00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:25,430
we can but it may not be fast enough to

00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:25,430
satisfy so yes back in the back

00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:45,809
of what of browsers not really you know

00:38:44,309 --> 00:38:48,690
we have some numbers like that but

00:38:45,809 --> 00:38:49,799
they're they're weird you know I mean

00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:51,960
because if you think about it it's sort

00:38:49,799 --> 00:38:53,369
of like when people use search trends to

00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,390
tell you how popular something is well

00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:56,690
no that's just how people have searched

00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,760
for them right so we have a very search

00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:01,530
view of the world right which is how we

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,510
derive our popularity numbers for things

00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:06,349
like browsers we actually don't track

00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:10,619
operating systems on incoming too much

00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:12,119
again it's very web focused and and we

00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:17,910
don't share that that often because we

00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:19,589
don't want to because we don't want to i

00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,400
will say most of the numbers that are

00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:22,920
out there in the public by the way

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,380
already very very accurate so those

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,819
aren't hard to come across so browser

00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:29,549
penetration numbers operating system

00:39:26,819 --> 00:39:31,740
penetration numbers so really we

00:39:29,549 --> 00:39:34,170
wouldn't be adding anything except for

00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,790
down to maybe the local level right you

00:39:34,170 --> 00:39:37,920
know like incomes and how many people

00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:39,450
are using Firefox and and and the

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,040
problem is you know when you start doing

00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:42,299
information at that level which is

00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,559
really what you have a hard time getting

00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:45,270
at i'll let you have a really popular

00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:47,730
website you actually started packing

00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:50,190
personal privacy and it's something

00:39:47,730 --> 00:39:51,930
we're incredibly sensitive about and so

00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,680
often will air on the on the side of not

00:39:51,930 --> 00:40:06,510
releasing data like that so sorry there

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:09,240
I point with my laser back blind you so

00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:11,160
we have a developer version out now for

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,020
linux and mac there they're pretty

00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,290
chunky and by chunky i mean they don't

00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:18,180
have you know bookmark management's not

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,960
great if it's there at all and

00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:21,930
everything it's there at all in the

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,760
linux one and plugins often will crash

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:27,180
the browser and you know things like

00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,640
that happen um there-there alpha code

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:31,880
you know believe it i use beta all the

00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,880
time

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,030
okay yeah you know the nice thing about

00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,890
the developer samples that are going on

00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,420
now around linux and mac is one you can

00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:44,160
get on the mailing list and and the

00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:45,360
project and and stay up with the

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,290
Knightley's i think a bunt to even ships

00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:54,060
a nightly um if you go to like our repo

00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:57,240
there but it's really fast so it'll

00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,440
crash really quickly no no seriously

00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,410
though it's actually not bad from

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,340
reliability standpoint better than I you

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:07,140
six right but it'll if you're expecting

00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,180
like super stable and done it's not done

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:10,380
yet we're thinking like probably of the

00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,810
six months before it's something that we

00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,790
can reasonably call a good product or at

00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,380
least usable for more than 15 minutes at

00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,180
a time or whatever but it's certainly

00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:21,510
fun to play with now so if you're into

00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:23,400
that kind of thing the the payment

00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:26,070
you'll you'll pay is just a little bit

00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:27,690
of crashing so and and it's a real pain

00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:31,170
about to bookmark things so how good is

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:34,500
that right so I think there's somebody

00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:39,600
over there yeah sorry you're kind of

00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:41,280
blinded there I have no idea i'll find

00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,110
out though so just email me or get on

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,590
the mailing list any one of those things

00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:48,620
where I don't know if they're doing from

00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:53,790
Firefox here could corroborate this

00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:55,650
plugins really really suck and having

00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:57,710
plugins that are 32-bit working inside

00:41:55,650 --> 00:42:00,540
for bit environment can often suck more

00:41:57,710 --> 00:42:02,430
and then we try to wrap the the

00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,500
individual tabs and their own process

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:08,220
space which it makes actually porting

00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:10,010
difficult and then makes 64 to 32 bit

00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:12,030
transitions even more difficult so I

00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:17,550
don't know the answer to that is sort of

00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:20,160
long short of it yeah you can do that

00:42:17,550 --> 00:42:22,710
now you can go to tmobile there's a

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,400
tmobile up tiger boulevard here i'm sure

00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,750
they're happy to get one for you yeah

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,040
well i don't know it's not been so bad

00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:33,090
you know I've been getting a couple pin

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,700
oh well now you can buy unlocked phones

00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:37,530
now so you can store to them from from

00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,480
from the site they're a little more I

00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:42,390
mean it's it you traded freedom for two

00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,119
hundred dollars off right

00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:46,470
you know and it's not that people

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,890
haven't figured out how to unlock them

00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:51,089
either but but yeah you know t-mobile is

00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:53,430
actually not a bad person to buy a phone

00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:54,990
from even even locked because after you

00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,829
you've been a customer of theirs for 90

00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:58,079
days they're happy to give you the

00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:59,490
unlock code and then you can go to town

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,859
with new sims and the rest I mean you

00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,000
live your to your contract but you know

00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:05,789
that's the bride should pay for a

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:08,010
cheaper phone but yeah you can you can

00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:09,690
order developer phones ATP one developer

00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:14,910
phones which are the keyboard slide-out

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:17,299
ones directly from us / brightstar which

00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:19,589
is our fomin house for them and then

00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:21,990
we'll have sapphire soon enough that's

00:43:19,589 --> 00:43:24,569
the that's this that's the touch screen

00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:27,289
version so those will be up in the store

00:43:24,569 --> 00:43:29,910
soon enough probable more expensive but

00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:31,260
yeah so so if you if you really want to

00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:32,849
go unlock that's the way to go you'll

00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,960
not maintaining it yourself you won't

00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:36,180
get over-the-air updates from t-mobile

00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:49,859
you know but you know you're all hackers

00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:51,150
here so that's easy yes yeah I haven't

00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:53,880
really categorize it by language those

00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:55,650
those lines of code I I know what we see

00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,660
internally and the problem is using

00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:00,420
google as a replacement for the whole

00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,160
world is problematic so google is a

00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,740
funny place right we use a ton of java

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,210
and then when things go slow because of

00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,890
the java nose which still happens

00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:13,890
although rarely we move it over to c++

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,750
right there are some people who love

00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,509
Python them like we use we use Python

00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:19,890
like crazy in the code google com team

00:44:17,509 --> 00:44:21,119
it's used by the group's team and a

00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:23,069
couple of the team so pythons still

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,700
first-class language but it's kind of a

00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:28,140
second first class right and so so yeah

00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,819
I think python is growing in popularity

00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:35,730
and part of that has to do with pearl

00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:39,839
failing to advance but you know but I

00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:41,819
might be wrong you know I'll have

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,400
differential numbers in about two weeks

00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:46,579
and that will try the last six months at

00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,079
least of growth just on the internet of

00:44:46,579 --> 00:44:50,640
languages but then we really only

00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,160
measuring that code which has been

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:54,329
released on the internet right so so

00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:56,599
what does your gut say how do you feel

00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:56,599
about it

00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:11,220
more do you work where do you work okay

00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:22,410
sure you gone all Ruby okay that's

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:24,150
probably good thing yeah i think you

00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:25,830
know i have i just got feeling about PHP

00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,680
but i don't know if it's real you know

00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:29,790
I've I just feel like like pearl is

00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:31,710
falling down cuz they're not advancing

00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:35,880
PHP is falling down because it is

00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:38,790
advancing weirdly you know so but you

00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:41,310
know they're all fine but I do think the

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,890
python has been measured and how it

00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:47,010
changes and that's appealing to people

00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:52,320
so at the same time ruby has gone crazy

00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:55,440
but crazily right so yeah I only have a

00:45:52,320 --> 00:46:00,930
couple questions left you over time as

00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:05,580
you look what seemed use your game yeah

00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:09,590
yeah it's true that's why true yeah yeah

00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:09,590
there's a O'Brien I run

00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:20,070
no now I well you know WebKit is sort of

00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:23,910
you know so web gets the HTML renderer

00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:25,260
v8 JavaScript renderer and no I mean we

00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:27,450
don't want to go away from WebKit we

00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:32,130
want to we want the main line of WebKit

00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:34,050
to be advancing you know well and and

00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:35,850
and this is actually a problem with

00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:37,950
WebKit in my opinion I i think the

00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:39,420
WebKit hasn't been advancing as well as

00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:42,870
it should have been but I don't see us

00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:46,950
working or anything crazy like that so

00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:48,450
yeah but there you go I you know I i

00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:52,920
wish the WebKit was moving a little

00:46:48,450 --> 00:47:07,500
faster you know so do we have time for

00:46:52,920 --> 00:47:11,250
one more hi ok open like to talk to you

00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:16,110
about this problem my problem is I do

00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:20,490
not know if it's legal for me to take a

00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:24,540
screenshot of a google map tropitone by

00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:30,750
desiring we use it however I please so

00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:33,360
what I've been doing is okay um what

00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:34,500
country are you in okay because if

00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:37,020
you're in England it would be illegal to

00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,270
do any of those things and there's a

00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:41,130
bunch of violence off of Africa where

00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:44,210
it's also illegal the Queen owns all the

00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,210
maps in England um

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,880
I actually I'm not familiar with the

00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:52,049
terms of service of google maps we try

00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,829
to encourage people to use the embedding

00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:59,910
API because it's it's nicer and I think

00:47:55,829 --> 00:48:01,859
there's a static image sort of service

00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:03,749
where you can grab the image you want

00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:04,980
from google maps open street maps is

00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:08,220
great though so i mean if it's working

00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,180
for you more power to you i honestly

00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,619
don't know what the terms of service for

00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,749
google map says about pulling static

00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:14,069
images because we actually want to move

00:48:12,749 --> 00:48:15,930
people away from that co static images

00:48:14,069 --> 00:48:17,700
are the way of death in our mind you

00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:20,130
know because they don't update you know

00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:23,759
new things show up you can't search

00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:29,489
nearby for hotels you know yeah they're

00:48:23,759 --> 00:48:30,839
fine for books sure yeah books those

00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:34,519
things with paper are you taking like

00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:37,019
ebooks like a kindle or something oh

00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:39,180
yeah no I you can email me and I can

00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:41,640
find out I mean the other problem with

00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:43,529
with with maps in general actually is

00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:46,140
often the imagery isn't owned by the

00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:48,210
people giving it to you right it's

00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:50,039
actually very rare free well it's

00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:52,980
actually impossible to give a global map

00:48:50,039 --> 00:48:54,210
and have all the imagery owned by 11

00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,579
company to give you the right to do that

00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:58,680
sometimes so and also might be the kind

00:48:56,579 --> 00:49:02,480
of thing where we can give you a static

00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:05,700
map for you know parts of cabo san lucas

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:09,509
much the united states some parts of

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,670
Canada but not Texas in Austin on the

00:49:09,509 --> 00:49:13,140
right side of the street you know I mean

00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:15,349
there's a lot of situations like that

00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,720
and it sounds ridiculous because it is

00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:20,039
but it's just it's the way of

00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,180
intellectual property in the United

00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:27,299
States and the world so what do you do

00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:29,519
I'm sorry Dick Cheney's house yeah

00:49:27,299 --> 00:49:32,339
Barbra Streisand says yeah whatever you

00:49:29,519 --> 00:49:33,749
know um yeah it's it's kind of a funny

00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:35,700
world and it's like you know is dick

00:49:33,749 --> 00:49:38,069
cheney any safer because we had his

00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,420
house be slightly blurrier you know and

00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:40,859
what's funny about it is it wasn't us

00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,470
blurring it right because since we buy

00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:46,009
satellite data from digital open others

00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:50,339
digital globe has to clear their imagery

00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:52,710
strategy with the National Oceanic and

00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:55,130
Atmospheric Administration who clears

00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:57,350
with the you know

00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,150
NASA in some cases an FCC with other so

00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:01,130
I mean it's a very complicated picture

00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:04,640
satellite imagery right and if you have

00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:06,920
it lower than you know one pixel per six

00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,850
inches then these organizations are

00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,160
going to want to have a say in your

00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:13,250
image pipeline I mean it's incredibly

00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:15,530
complex right so so the answer is often

00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,450
as complex well you know where is that

00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:19,730
static image well it's outside of clones

00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,500
in on this one Street okay well in that

00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:24,110
case we're going to be using you know

00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:25,610
navteq tiles that were derived from an

00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:26,900
original tele atlas database which came

00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:29,090
from the Queen of England and it's like

00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:31,220
what you know and in that case the

00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:33,680
answer would be no but in the case where

00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:36,200
we ourselves drew it or we had a street

00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,410
view car tracing some line well then

00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:42,470
okay you know so it's kind of ridiculous

00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:44,270
and I wish it wasn't so but sometimes

00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:52,130
are not ours to give I think that's it

00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:53,600
he's like yeah I have a laser so so

00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:58,490
thank you for having me and thank you

00:50:53,600 --> 00:51:00,770
