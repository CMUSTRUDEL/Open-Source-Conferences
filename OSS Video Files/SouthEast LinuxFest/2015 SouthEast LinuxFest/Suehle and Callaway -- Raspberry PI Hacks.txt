how much I got oh hey

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:42,989
see ya oh that's not at all disturbing

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,739
now what happens when you turn on your

00:00:45,550 --> 00:01:01,180
mic do you guys hear that I'll call a co

00:00:47,739 --> 00:01:03,780
or is that just a state okay hello screw

00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,780
it we'll do it live

00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:21,780
turned it off because it sounded like

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:31,680
that okay do you want me to keep talking

00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:34,910
so your phone can tell you things hello

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,900
customers out there in the YouTube land

00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,610
do you really want me to give this whole

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:46,200
presentation sounding like a weird

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:52,620
Madonna video the audience has spoken

00:02:46,200 --> 00:03:02,220
I don't have a Python to dance with no

00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:04,860
weird costumes is that better it sounds

00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:08,970
okay you guys okay with the weird

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:13,050
Madonna land all right then we're coming

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:17,040
to you live from the bat cave south east

00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,860
west my name is Tom Calloway this lovely

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,120
lady here is Ruth Seeley we are gonna be

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:29,870
talking about raspberry pi hacks we

00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:29,870
wrote this lovely book that's weird echo

00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:40,410
plant my feet we wrote this book called

00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:45,090
raspberry pi hacks oh he needs the

00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:53,180
previous slide sorry what do you need

00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:55,290
from us okay there you go this is us

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:57,720
we'll talk more about that picture at

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,640
the end okay let's roll we're at a cool

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,410
back I think we were to book called

00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,750
Raspberry Pi hacks and the point of the

00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,910
book was to help people figure out what

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,610
to do with their $35 Raspberry Pi

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,760
because we found that lots of people had

00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,260
one but hadn't really done anything with

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,900
it here's how we prove this how many of

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,070
you have a PI how many of you done

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,580
something with your PI that is not XBMC

00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:26,150
well that is better than average

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,379
yeah we're usually left with like to one

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,060
of my favorite sounds like all right

00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:30,289
what do you have it he had he was

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,740
controlling his big mouth Billy bass

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:32,740
with it

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:40,940
so the the pie idea came about in early

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:42,979
2006 by abbot upton he was a chip

00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,240
architect at Broadcom and he got

00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:46,310
together with some other people

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,319
he was also teaching at Cambridge and

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,840
and saw the students who are coming in

00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:53,539
now don't have the same experience that

00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,120
students coming in had 20 years ago say

00:04:53,539 --> 00:04:57,590
or maybe even 10 years ago they don't

00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,479
know as much about the hardware they

00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:02,270
don't have as much softer experience and

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:06,919
so the entire idea the pie was to give

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:09,020
an inexpensive way to teach software and

00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:12,020
hardware skills specifically Python

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,879
which is why it's called the PI 2 people

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,530
before they get to college so that they

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:19,610
weren't wasting so much time when you

00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:22,340
only have theoretically 4 years to teach

00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:24,229
computer science students and so the

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,080
first alpha boards were available in

00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:28,669
August 2011 you could actually buy them

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,830
in January 2012 the model B

00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:33,860
manufacturers started shipping in April

00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:35,060
the first run was 10,000 boards because

00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:38,180
that was all they thought they would

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,279
ever sell and they crash both websites

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,990
that were selling them that day and now

00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:47,180
what are we at like 2 million in the

00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:49,430
wild yeah so highly successful and this

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:53,900
is what it looks like now this is the

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:57,550
this is the B+ I think it tells you

00:05:53,900 --> 00:06:00,169
right there on how convenient

00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:02,029
this is a slightly older picture because

00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:05,330
the B+ has been superseded by the

00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:07,969
Raspberry Pi 2 and in this convenient

00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:11,990
picture you see comparison between the

00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:16,550
old BB pup B+ model and the Raspberry Pi

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,789
2 and this just gives you a brief idea

00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:21,500
of what the difference is among the the

00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:23,419
models that are available now you can't

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,190
still buy the B's and the B pluses and

00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:29,449
they actually drop the price of the B+

00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:33,830
to get rid of the last few I think this

00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:36,139
is what the GPIO GPIO looks like on the

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,539
the new Raspberry Pi 2 the first

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,650
26 pins are identical so if you have

00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:42,259
projects if you want to follow

00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,629
instructions that were you know say out

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,610
of our fantastic book that were written

00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:48,499
before the Raspberry Pi 2 is released

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:51,469
you can still do that because those pins

00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:52,460
are identical you just have more now and

00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:55,039
for those of you who don't know what

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,029
GPIO is that's the general purpose input

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,300
output so that you can connect basically

00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:04,610
anything with wires to the Raspberry Pi

00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:06,620
the nice thing about the PI's

00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,120
flexibility on the GPIO is all of these

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,039
are reconfigurable in software so just

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,469
because they have specific purposes in

00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,210
the environment doesn't mean that you

00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:16,639
can't then reassign them for whatever

00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:18,050
needs that you have the one thing to

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,330
keep in mind if you've ever done GPIO

00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:24,409
work with Arduino for example the

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:27,770
Arduino 10 3 5 volt and pi is 3.3 so you

00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:29,750
just need to keep that in mind and if

00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,889
you look at your pins and go huh there's

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,060
not really labeled all that well and I

00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:33,199
have no idea what to do with them this

00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,779
is perhaps one of the most fantastic

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,219
projects anybody came up with dr. Simon

00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,389
Monk has actually done a lot not just

00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:39,949
with the PI but was smarter we know

00:07:38,389 --> 00:07:41,330
stuff and if you look up Arduino books

00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:45,379
you'll find several that he's written I

00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:46,550
think his what is happening I think the

00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:48,349
most recent one is something like

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,150
Arduino projects for the evil genius or

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:51,439
something I think that's one of his and

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:53,330
this was one of the first things that I

00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,710
knew of him to have done was that you

00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,879
could just go to his website and print

00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:57,349
out this handy little thing called the

00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:58,580
raspberry leaves stick it on your GPIO

00:07:57,349 --> 00:08:00,169
and not have to try to figure out what

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,819
they all were all the time if you would

00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,199
like to simply purchase one Adafruit has

00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:06,560
two versions and they're available for

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,819
all of the PI's and if you don't know

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,020
which PI you have because it's been

00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:10,250
sitting in a drawer for the last two

00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,490
years and you don't actually remember

00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,469
what you bought anymore you can just do

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,089
this and it will tell you at that little

00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,919
revision line the second one from the

00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:22,189
bottom if it's a 2 through 6 it's the

00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:24,379
model B that only had 256 Meg of RAM if

00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:26,479
it is 7 through 9 it is the model a with

00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:28,069
256 and if it's D through F it's the

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,629
model B that has 512 and I actually

00:08:28,069 --> 00:08:31,370
don't know how the 2 shows up we should

00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,199
run it and find out we should we

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,190
actually only finally just got around to

00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:36,529
buying some twos

00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:39,229
a month and a half ago or something so

00:08:36,529 --> 00:08:41,209
but like we said the the beginning of

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:42,769
the GPIO pins which is where all the

00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:45,319
super fun stuff happens are still

00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:47,839
identical so there are a few things that

00:08:45,319 --> 00:08:49,699
I'm going to show you projects that were

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,060
done originally with raspberry Pi twos

00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,980
they've been

00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:55,390
done more recently but for the most part

00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:58,100
you can do everything with any of them

00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:58,850
yeah but the one of the most important

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,400
things to keep in mind when you're

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,490
working with the PI 2 or the PI for that

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:06,529
matter is to get a good SD card the PI

00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,060
doesn't boot off of anything but the SD

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:10,670
it doesn't have any built-in flash and

00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,500
so one of the things to remember is that

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,450
SD cards are made as cheaply as humanly

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,089
possible if they could make SD cards out

00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:20,750
of vanilla wafers they would absolutely

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:23,510
do that so you're gonna want to try to

00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:26,480
get a good quality card and that's a not

00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,460
a trivial task because if you go to your

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,500
local Walgreens or CVS you will find any

00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,240
number of SD cards that are sold you can

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,950
buy one that has literally the exact

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,750
branding have it be good come back in a

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,700
month buy the exact same branding and

00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:42,500
have to be bad found 2 in my pocket

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:45,170
really good I'm sure there so what is

00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,940
common is you're gonna see that there's

00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,600
a lot of cards that are micro cards they

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:52,580
come after that's fine there were some

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:56,600
very early bugs in the Raspberry Pi

00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:59,300
where because the PI one used the

00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:00,950
full-size SD card slot the PI 2 uses the

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,270
micro slot so you no longer need the

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,589
adapter and in fact it's actually

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:05,000
beneficial if you had one of those

00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:06,170
micros with the adapter because you can

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,780
switch it between either one of the PI's

00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,970
now there's a pretty good community

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,010
website called a Linux org that stands

00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:16,490
for embedded Linux they track a whole

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,570
lot of embedded Linux discussions but

00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,190
they also have a ton of good material

00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:20,450
about the Raspberry Pi and in fact if

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,710
you're looking for anything technical

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:23,450
about the Raspberry Pi and the link is

00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:25,880
olynyk's you're probably off to a good

00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:28,100
start so they have a list of SD cards

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,780
that people are tracking to try to

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,490
determine whether the cards are good or

00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,080
bad in whichever batch you ended up

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:34,970
getting obviously that's not foolproof

00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,310
given that they rebrand them identically

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,470
with the exact same serial numbers and

00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,910
one is good and one is bad but the good

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:42,740
news is most SD cards are pretty cheap

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,060
so if one is bad then you throw it away

00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,500
and you get a different one they also

00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,760
don't live very long especially if

00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,380
you're doing a ton of write operations

00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,910
to it so keep that in mind as you're

00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,200
thinking about your Raspberry Pi project

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,790
where you plan on mounting something in

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,440
a tree to watchbirds for the next 10

00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:56,330
years that that SD card is not going to

00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,850
live that long we didn't talk much about

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,110
the the changes that they made for the

00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,150
Raspberry Pi 2 but one of the most

00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:03,690
useful as they switch from a plastic SD

00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,430
card slot holder to a metal

00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,500
and we had cases that we bought from I

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,780
think Adafruit that would when you try

00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,180
to put in an SD card would snap that

00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:14,310
plastic holder that held your SD card in

00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,170
and now you have you can tape your SD

00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:18,090
card in it was it was awful I'm so glad

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,510
they switched a metal so now that you

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:26,270
have an SD card you need a distro yeah

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:26,270
now there is no right answer PI Dora but

00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:32,220
but we being from Red Hat or a little

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,430
bit we tend to prefer the Red Hat flavor

00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,440
of distributions but raspbian is also a

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:40,290
very very popular distribution for the

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,710
PI and then there's things like raspbmc

00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:45,840
which is a custom distribution for doing

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,910
XBMC on the PI if you were thinking

00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,170
about doing XBMC on the PI don't waste

00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,550
your time trying to slap it on top of

00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,290
your favorite distribution just get

00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,910
something like raspbmc and save yourself

00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:57,120
the next two hours of your life which i

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,490
believe is now called ki no keep it

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,170
changed names I think they do and I

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:02,970
mission occidentalis because I think

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,010
that it has often been poorly described

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:06,450
as an education distro except what it

00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:08,370
really means if you keep reading their

00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,510
description is usually use that if

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,560
you're a serious hardware hacker and

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,600
kind of already know what you're doing

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,530
and so I think education distro is a bit

00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,380
misleading

00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:18,180
yes occidentalis has all of the Adafruit

00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,500
libraries for all of their third-party

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,210
components they sell for the Raspberry

00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,350
Pi already incorporated inside of it so

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,660
it's a great way if you are buying

00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,250
things from Adafruit specifically just

00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,780
going with occidentalis as the starting

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,190
port is a good base and if you don't

00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,740
like one of those there are a few other

00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:33,420
options available some of which are

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,830
designed for very specific purposes some

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,230
of which are general distributions

00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:38,810
even exit org has has some information

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:41,340
on creating your own distro if for some

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:42,750
reason that I cannot even fathom none of

00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,070
these suit your interest at all and you

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,880
have just decided that all you want to

00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:46,770
do in the world has created another

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,660
Raspberry Pi distribution good for you

00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:51,750
also get out now we don't to hear that

00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,700
question what you will find if you go to

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,590
raspberry pi org and want to get started

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:57,720
is newbs stands for new out of box

00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,340
software and this is what you see when

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:03,720
you start and what makes this really

00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:06,060
great is if you ade sometimes maybe do

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,890
stupid things or be are giving it to

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,560
children who definitely often do stupid

00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,330
things this gives you instant restart

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,680
option you hold down shift at boot and

00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:16,230
you get this menu again and you get a

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,310
do-over it has changed a little bit

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:19,410
today it only

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,060
raspy the raspbian archive actually on

00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,529
the image and you need a network

00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,120
connection if you want any of the rest

00:13:22,529 --> 00:13:25,079
of them but if nothing else even if you

00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,579
don't have the network connection you

00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:28,410
can at least get a do-over with raspbian

00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,209
and it's also super awesome if you are

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:31,829
teaching a kid about linux and you want

00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:33,149
to explain to them that there are a lot

00:13:31,829 --> 00:13:34,620
of similarities but also some

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:35,970
differences you can say hold down shift

00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,339
try another one and you can see it

00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:42,689
immediately so if you're trying to

00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,100
install your image you've picked

00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:46,110
whatever you want there's a couple

00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:47,430
different ways to do it even if you're

00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:49,019
not using fedora there's a fantastic

00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:52,019
tool that the fedora community has built

00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:53,910
to install images onto SD cards for arm

00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:55,559
deployments it's called a fedora arm

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,939
installer because if we don't put our

00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,879
name on it you know no one will know we

00:13:56,939 --> 00:14:01,230
made it and you can install that it's a

00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,550
really simple graphical tool that allows

00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,110
you to basically say this is my image

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,249
file this is the SD card I wanted to go

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,589
to it writes it out and does a pretty

00:14:05,249 --> 00:14:09,480
good job if you're trying to do this on

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:12,180
a Mac there's a tool called the rpi SD

00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,009
card builder or as PI right you can

00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,930
google these and there's the github link

00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:22,559
for the ladder if you're on Windows you

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:23,939
are at the wrong conference raspberry pi

00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,559
things you can simply buy a pre-loaded

00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:28,949
SD card and save yourself that whole

00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:30,269
five minutes of your life all right now

00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:31,139
power is the biggest thing to keep in

00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:34,129
mind when you're working with the

00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:38,509
Raspberry Pi the PI wants five volts

00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:42,959
no more no less exactly five volts now

00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:45,000
when you are working with your PI and

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,430
you notice that it is doing weird and

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,230
strange things like your Wireless keeps

00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:50,850
dropping for no good reason or your

00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,800
keyboard will pretend it doesn't exist

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,750
and then a whole bunch of T's will show

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,639
up these are power problems these are

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,990
not device driver problems they're not

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,660
livings kernel problems they are all

00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,370
power problems I guarantee it it means

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:04,079
you do not have clean power running into

00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,730
that device or the devices that you have

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,379
hooked into it are drawing so much power

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,929
across that you're not able to power the

00:15:07,379 --> 00:15:11,819
PI fully the PI will do its best to try

00:15:09,929 --> 00:15:14,639
to stay alive when you give it less

00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:16,679
power than it needs but things start to

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,259
behave poorly and one of the reasons is

00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,149
is because the USB ports that are on the

00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:22,920
PI are low power ports they're not high

00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,990
power ports most of your devices that

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,579
you see and then have USB are high ports

00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:28,649
and most of the devices you're plugging

00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:30,610
in our high power and the PI will do its

00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:32,200
best to give as much power as a

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,779
into those ports but is almost never

00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:37,180
enough unless you are running a clean 5

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,279
volt 1 amp power line to the PI so

00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,820
Adafruit has a fantastic plug that you

00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:46,540
can buy that is 5 volt 1 amp bonus that

00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:49,839
charger that runs at 5 volt 1 amp for

00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:51,279
the PI will charge your phone faster

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,380
assuming you have a real phone and not

00:15:51,279 --> 00:16:02,200
an iPhone I can help but the wrong

00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:04,029
contract but the charger that you get

00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,560
with most of your phones is remarkably

00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,810
cheap it is not giving you 5 volts 1

00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,010
amps or for your tablets they want

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:12,040
actually more amperage than that to be

00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:13,180
able to charge so you get a faster

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,740
charge as a result of having the better

00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,540
charger and that's a little tidbit

00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:18,459
secret if you're in eager to get your

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,560
phone to charge faster we will

00:16:18,459 --> 00:16:22,660
demonstrate probably several more times

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,430
that the PI is often tolerant of your

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,930
stupidity and probably will put up with

00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:27,610
several of these things like not enough

00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,190
power or powering it off your laptops

00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:30,579
USB for it or whatever some days it

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,019
won't

00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,670
and then you'll think but yesterday it

00:16:32,019 --> 00:16:34,870
was fine well you should probably figure

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:36,190
out what's good and it will be one in

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,959
the morning on the day before the talk

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:41,890
and you're like why is this not working

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:42,850
I would never this is a slide out of

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:45,430
order but I'll tell you about it anyway

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:47,170
this is a usual e mentioned after the

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:52,029
distros because somebody's like what

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,800
Android on my pot this one no it is

00:16:52,029 --> 00:16:55,480
technically possible and I just checked

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,160
in yesterday to see what was going on

00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,380
they haven't updated their page at all

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,779
in about two years and actually with the

00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,790
PI 2 it probably is a slightly better

00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:06,069
scenario than it used to be with the PI

00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,319
1 yeah so they there's just a post on

00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,850
their Google Groups very recently that

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,770
they have an image for the PI 2 with

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:15,579
pre-installed KitKat on the very boot

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:17,679
boot loader thing you can do it I did it

00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,240
one day it is the slowest computer you

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,010
will ever use in your life like you move

00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,959
your mouse and then you sit back and

00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:23,949
then you watch the mouse kind of move

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,679
across the screen

00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,640
it's excruciating ly slow but if that's

00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:32,410
what you need to do with your life and

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,820
you so display options these are all the

00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:35,410
nitty gritty details that every now and

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,980
then somebody wants to know the PI

00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:41,679
supports HDMI Rev 1.3 1.4 the PI 2 has

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,200
14 HDMI resolutions from 640 by 350 to

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,690
1920 by 1200 plus all the various power

00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,950
TSC standards these are for you know all

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,010
of you folks with international monitors

00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:53,049
I'm sure all of you have one of those

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,909
it has composite video out the PI one

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:56,380
had composite video out over a dedicated

00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:58,630
composite video out one of the yellow

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,940
plug ports they got rid of that and they

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,769
combined it with the TRS jack so that

00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:04,059
you can do the audio out and the video

00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:05,440
across that you just have to have the

00:18:04,059 --> 00:18:07,389
right converter cable so you can still

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,529
do composite line out you've just got to

00:18:07,389 --> 00:18:12,010
jump it through the right converter

00:18:08,529 --> 00:18:14,409
there is no VGA on the PI there are all

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:17,980
sorts of ways to get VGA out if you are

00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:19,360
still living in the 80s but it doesn't

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,340
have anything built onto it and there's

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,799
a gentleman who is in the UK who built a

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,799
lovely thing that uses up all the GPIO

00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,590
pins to add a VGA outboard to it and

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,690
then realise that it was making so much

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:33,789
noise that it would never get FCC

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,200
approval so he put all the plans for it

00:18:33,789 --> 00:18:36,789
on github so if you really want to build

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,769
a fun little VGA connector for it you

00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:40,299
can there's also a DSi connector on

00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:41,980
there if you've ever worked with

00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,039
embedded equipment DSi is a standard

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,549
connector type for screens and the PI

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,769
has a lovely DSi connector there are

00:18:48,549 --> 00:18:52,630
also other things you can use besides a

00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:54,190
regular old monitor this is one of my

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,590
favorite projects if for no other reason

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:58,389
and to read his instructions so even if

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:00,580
you have no intention about using a

00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:01,899
Kindle as a display you should just go

00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,039
to this blog post and I'll post these

00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:05,380
slides later where you can get all the

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:07,960
URLs that are in it because he insults

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,309
you the whole way he suggests that you

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,630
have a spare Kindle because you're going

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:12,970
to do something really stupid along the

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,250
way and destroy the first one he says

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,809
things like you should you're gonna open

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,919
a terminal emulator and he says if you

00:19:16,809 --> 00:19:18,820
don't know what a terminal is well I'm

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,190
not sure why you're reading this article

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,600
in the first place it's really it's a

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,970
lot of fun reading but it works out this

00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:27,130
is the old style of Kindle and it runs

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:30,730
off of a little micro USB slot and so

00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:31,899
it's perfect this is the sort of thing

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,919
that Tom was mentioning that you will

00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:34,090
try to make work right before your

00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,940
talking for some reason it has stopped

00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:39,399
working but this is the motorola atrix

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,860
lap dock which the motorola atrix was a

00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:44,110
super expensive phone that only was

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,970
really useful for a very short period of

00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:47,200
time compared to the cost of it and this

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,429
is one of the very expensive accessories

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,500
that went along with it I think it was

00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:51,909
about $400 but you put your phone into

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,309
the back of it and then it turns it into

00:19:51,909 --> 00:19:56,230
a tiny little laptop now that thing is

00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:57,610
about 40 bucks on ebay and it has an

00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,290
HDMI connector

00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,640
you put a pie on the back of it and you

00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:02,650
have a screen and a keyboard attached to

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,600
it it does however require what I call

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:09,670
the magical unicorn dongle which is I

00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:11,710
believe a male microUSB to female

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:12,820
regular USB that even fries in

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,470
California which I thought sold

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,059
everything didn't sell and then you have

00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,730
to carve out a little bit of the plastic

00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:20,679
on it and yeah it's a magical unicorn

00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:22,179
connector we do have one at the fedora

00:20:20,679 --> 00:20:24,010
booth if you would like to come by and

00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:25,390
look at it but for whatever reason today

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,120
it is decided that it doesn't wanna play

00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:30,640
with us they also have laptops connected

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,020
to a PI's at the registration desk so if

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,340
you registered and checked in you were

00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,900
actually using a laptop connected to a

00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:36,900
PI I didn't register myself

00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,460
remember that DSi connector I brought up

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:43,990
before that I talked about well one of

00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,270
the first things I wanted to do was to

00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,950
find some sort of generic device break

00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:49,540
it open take the screen off of it plug

00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:51,940
it into the PI while I instant screen

00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:54,400
across the DSi connector sadly it is not

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,720
that simple really what I wanted was I

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,980
wanted a touchscreen because most of the

00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,390
touchscreens that are out there have a

00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:02,230
DSi connector and it's really easy to

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,809
attach to that and the PI doesn't

00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:07,090
currently have any support for any

00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:08,200
devices using the DSi connector that

00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,570
would have to be added in the firmware

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,280
so that they could detect the device and

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,049
the grand total of devices support it

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:15,429
being zero means that I had to find

00:21:14,049 --> 00:21:17,410
another way to get a touchscreen working

00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,610
so when the internet looked for standard

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,679
touch screens that are out there and I

00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,000
found a MIMO 720 which is a little bit

00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,760
dated now but at the time it was a

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,830
pretty current model and it's a display

00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,299
link device and I thought that's easy as

00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:30,460
USB port so that should be really

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:33,250
straightforward to do so I went to plug

00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:36,250
it in and PI Linux environments didn't

00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,450
see it at all and so I said well alright

00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,890
well what do I need to do to get this

00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:40,780
working and so the magic things think if

00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:42,820
it's working is you need to enable the

00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:44,559
either the frame buffer driver which is

00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:46,480
the one that works the best or the

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,000
kernel mode setting driver which is it

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,559
works but it's a little bit more finicky

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,850
and then you can get that to work now

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,740
the biggest downside with doing a

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,419
display link device is that the video

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,620
card inside of the device is actually

00:21:55,419 --> 00:22:01,390
driving it and it's not fast at all nor

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,770
is it 3d accelerated so if you're

00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,679
planning on watching a movie being able

00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:07,270
to take advantage of the built-in GPU

00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:09,490
optimizations that are inside the PI I

00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:11,670
it doesn't take advantage of the GPU on

00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:14,620
the PI at all so it's good for

00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,850
want to have a simply display access to

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:20,980
the pipe if you're trying to do anything

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:22,480
3d or video it's not a good bet now

00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,830
let's say that you want to make these

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,060
changes you want to go ahead and start

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:26,410
building your own kernel the good news

00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,420
is is that they have all the kernel

00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:30,910
sources for their Linux kernel image on

00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:32,710
github unfortunately all those changes

00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:34,900
have yet to be merged into the upstream

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:36,550
Linux kernel so we're not quite where we

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,140
want to be where we just say start with

00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:39,670
the Linux kernel sources check these

00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,410
options and you're good to go you're

00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:42,880
still having to use their tree but their

00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,130
tree is extremely straightforward so if

00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,450
you do a git clone of their tree you'll

00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:49,030
see that it is the Linux kernel with

00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:50,350
their patches and add-ons made to it or

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,360
you can get a tarball of pre-built

00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,830
source at a specific version and then

00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:56,140
you can run the make mr. proper command

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,050
and be on your way to kernel building

00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,610
happiness and we talked a bit about

00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:02,080
power if you're fairly new to hardware

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,060
that little silver cylinder that I

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,310
circled is not the thumb holder in front

00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:07,690
of the power outlet wid that you hold

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,920
when you plug it in which is what

00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:11,320
apparently a lot of people think that it

00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:12,670
is and then it snaps right off and so if

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,780
that has happened to you or happens to

00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:15,070
you in the future that is the phrase

00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:17,020
that you google if you decide to replace

00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:18,790
it your PI will probably run without it

00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:21,640
all it does is stabilize the DC power

00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,690
but don't put your thumb there and then

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,940
you'll solve all your problems

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,860
now you may have noticed that the PI

00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:29,410
does not have an off switch or an on

00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,400
switch for that matter and so that you

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,280
just when you're done with it you just

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,320
yank the power cord well SD card doesn't

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,820
love life that much when you're

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,770
constantly pulling the power on it while

00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,090
it's doing right operations so one of

00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:42,160
the things you can do is you can

00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,510
actually add an off switch so it circled

00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,790
on the diagram and the lovely picture

00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:48,970
here is the location where if you add a

00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:50,230
toggle switch with a wee bit of solder a

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,660
little bit at a time

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,190
do you header pins and p6 yep and then

00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,810
all of a sudden you've got a very simple

00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:57,640
power switch well you sort them out and

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:02,080
then you have it's not a switch you can

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:03,370
put a switch in there you could this is

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,870
resolution to everything you do with a

00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:07,330
safety pin yeah that's why you have so

00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,680
many holes in a leaks all the time if

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:10,570
you find that you think you're having

00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:12,130
power problems and you want to test your

00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,210
voltage you can verify how much power

00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,910
you're getting with these test points

00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,590
there are T P 1 and T P 2 so if you get

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:18,760
out your multimeter and you plug in all

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:20,140
your peripherals for your project

00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:22,180
everything that you want to be happening

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,100
and set your range to 20 volts you touch

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:25,480
the red leads at ep 1 which is 5 volt

00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,860
and you're back way to TPT

00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,480
which is ground and you want to be

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,360
seeing at least four point eight it has

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,280
a tolerance of about 0.25 but four point

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,690
eight would be good times if you're

00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,669
seeing significant less than that even

00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:40,780
if it's four seven four six that is why

00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:42,669
your Wireless is working poorly so this

00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:44,470
shows a couple of things one is the I

00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:47,200
think only remaining poly fuse on it

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,640
which if if something immediately has

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,500
happened you can give it some time and

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,960
the poly fuse may recover if you've done

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,330
something really terrible it may not but

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,179
you can also test the voltage coming in

00:24:55,330 --> 00:25:00,160
on the back here which is used TP to

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:01,630
which you saw before and then f3 which

00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,669
is on this side this is the reverse side

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,710
near the SD card and that will tell you

00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,210
the voltage coming from the fuse that's

00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:08,590
especially useful if you're powering it

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,730
with a non conventional power source

00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,049
like a solar panel or something else

00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,790
it's really good to be able to see

00:25:11,049 --> 00:25:15,309
whether you're getting good clean power

00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,540
of the right voltage in now while your

00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:18,250
pie does not have something handy like

00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,049
an on/off switch it does have some LEDs

00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,460
that are not just there so you can find

00:25:20,049 --> 00:25:23,470
your pie in the dark although I may have

00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,750
done that once or twice they tell you

00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:28,120
useful things this series of LEDs if

00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:29,440
green is on it means your sdcard is

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,900
alive and that's a good start and the

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,640
pie recognizes that it exists that is an

00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:35,320
A+ well no not if your pie is not

00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:37,240
running but it's a good start the red

00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:38,650
one is power and it should be solidly on

00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,799
if it is not then that is a power

00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:43,090
problem if the orange LNK is on that

00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:44,470
means your ethernet is connected if the

00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,120
other orange pins on that means you're

00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:47,530
getting full deep duplex and the orange

00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:49,419
100 is on where the connection is a

00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,400
hundred megabits per second if your

00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:52,750
green one is blinking this is more or

00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,280
less what it tells you but different

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,200
versions of the firmware have resulted

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,030
in different series of blinks and so you

00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,010
linux org will tell you specifically for

00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,600
your pi what your assorted blinking

00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:04,090
problems means specifically in that

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,290
three through seven blinking area we

00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:09,360
hope you all took notes because there

00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:12,630
will be a quiz and slides posted online

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,740
alright so let's look at cool projects

00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:16,330
first thing you're gonna need is a case

00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:18,190
and you have a lot of options for a case

00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:19,750
you can make one if you're tom you can

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,340
3d print one and actually probably the

00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,559
best cases we've had were the 3d printed

00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:25,960
ones you can buy one there are plenty of

00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:27,880
cases places to buy one or one time when

00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:29,470
I said this a guy held up his case which

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,179
was the cardboard box that came in and

00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:34,350
he had exact it out all of the slots

00:26:31,179 --> 00:26:37,059
around it and he's like this is my case

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:39,430
work perfectly well although I can

00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:41,260
attest that if you have it in that case

00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:46,330
and you step on it in the floor the gpio

00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:48,460
still really hurt a lot this is probably

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:50,230
the best best case we've ever found and

00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,880
this is the one that Southern California

00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,559
Linux Expo was using on they were

00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,240
running registration off their pies a

00:26:53,559 --> 00:26:56,830
couple of years ago and this is the case

00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,170
that was in and it gave me one and that

00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:01,330
thing rattles around my backpack it's

00:26:59,170 --> 00:27:02,500
fantastic the only downside and syntek

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,820
is the word you can google if you want

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,559
to buy it the only downside to it is it

00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,300
doesn't have slots for everything around

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:08,590
you can see there's no GPIO cutout on

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,420
the top I think there's a little slot on

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,490
the side so it's a little hard to get to

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,870
in its screws shut but just for a pie

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,300
that you want to plug in that thing is

00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:17,410
awesome you can also build them out of

00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,240
Legos especially if you have children

00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:21,130
that you can steal Legos from and so

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,290
this is just a couple of cooler ones

00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:26,920
that I like that's still from the

00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:29,860
internet this one is assorted Lea

00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:32,440
described as sarbanes-oxley compliant

00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:36,370
and meeting various other standards the

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:38,350
PI workplace or you can just buy a Lego

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,090
kit and if you'd like to come by the

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:42,580
fedora booth later I can give you my

00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:43,780
dissertation on the price of Lego bricks

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:48,190
and how much you should be paying for

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,540
brick but this one's a bit high RedHat

00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:51,809
booth fedorable they're next to each

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,340
other I'm sitting in the middle okay

00:27:51,809 --> 00:27:55,630
well I can't be Fedora now I got fedora

00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,550
on my slides you don't want me to be a

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:01,480
part of Fedora I won't write you Fedora

00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:04,210
Tex anymore you can also 3d print all

00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,030
sorts of designs this is a old school in

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:09,550
the ass case and it's it's pretty sweet

00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:11,140
because you can print it so that it has

00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:12,610
the pie in the right orientation that

00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:14,590
the SD card for the pie one is actually

00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:16,480
sticking out doesn't look as cool with

00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:18,370
the pie two anymore because the SD card

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:23,200
holder is underneath but still a very

00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:28,120
very neat idea for a case or if you want

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:30,970
to go even older school to print your to

00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,070
be to be clear to be clear that is an

00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:39,190
Apple to case with a pie in it sitting

00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:40,870
on top of an apple 2e this is the idea I

00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,700
got from Rodney who would raise his hand

00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:44,140
and wave because I met him in this talk

00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,020
like two years ago well that was the

00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:49,360
least enthusiastic wave in history what

00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,590
he did was drill some holes in an old

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,970
cutting board this is actually a 3d

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,550
printed but it's the same idea drill

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,680
some holes in a

00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:55,820
big board and and attach the PI and then

00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,810
you got a little handle and you can just

00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,820
carry it around which I thought was

00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,230
super clever and actually could you

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,190
print me one of these because my kid

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:07,640
lost her Arduino case you got it or this

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,920
one and this is a case that is 3d

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,150
printed out of this elastic polymer so

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,440
that it's a little bit squishy it's a

00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:15,320
little bit bouncy and he's got the PI

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:18,320
and some power bricks in there as well

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,480
as some neopixels and an accelerometer

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,370
and so it's not just a case but he can

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,230
make art with it by tracing the patterns

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:26,960
that it takes when he throws it down the

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,850
stairs or he can change the LED blinking

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,390
patterns or do all sorts of other things

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:33,830
with it yeah kind of fun because there

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,850
will be a point in your experimentation

00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,530
with the PI in which you will

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,290
desperately want to be able to throw

00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:40,370
your PI down the stairs plus everybody

00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:44,870
like something's light up and blink

00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:47,240
great this is a cool little device that

00:29:44,870 --> 00:29:49,850
broad can't Broadcom came up with it's a

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,920
USB hub and Wi-Fi adapter so like Tom

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:53,690
mentioned you need a powered USB hub and

00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:56,660
this one kind of fixes your problems for

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,790
you it does have support for external

00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,930
power which is sold separately from it I

00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,270
think you have to actually buy the power

00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:05,950
adapter but it is an option and it has a

00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:08,000
Wi-Fi adapter with a 211 B G and N and

00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:09,110
pretty hand a little dongle yeah I'm

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,910
just gonna point out one thing that I

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,790
want to reinforce that she just said if

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:16,640
you're using a USB hub with app I use a

00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:17,960
powered one don't use one of the cheapo

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,610
ones that we're giving out here at the

00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,400
conference it doesn't have a power cord

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,930
not we someone might be someone might be

00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,500
I have a box full of them but I'm max

00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:29,600
amount don't but the the reasoning is is

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,980
that you're not the power drop between

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,990
each one of these connections across the

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,700
hub it will barely show up if at all

00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,840
there will be times where it will show

00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:37,820
up just long enough for the kernel

00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:40,640
driver to load and then it can't see it

00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:42,770
anymore so powered hub good thing or you

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,140
type s and then five minutes later 20s

00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,580
is go across the screen yeah but this

00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,590
actually solves two problems of putting

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,360
your Wi-Fi and your USB hub and one

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:52,250
thing and so that because especially

00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,930
before they put four ports on the

00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:57,350
Raspberry Pi 2 you're always going on

00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:58,880
before USB all right so now you got to

00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:00,350
make something with your PI now that you

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,280
got a case you figured out all your

00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,780
hardware problems you know what you're

00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,340
gonna do snagging your project I asked

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:05,779
how many how many of you again have done

00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:08,960
XBMC or whatever

00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:11,419
called now Cody Cody not Kino Cody

00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:12,559
that's the name of it uh they have they

00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:13,999
have a really cool couch and they do

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:15,440
conference boots an inflatable couch

00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:17,809
highly recommended you can sit there and

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,919
play games on there they're machine this

00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:21,590
is what a lot of people start with

00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:24,679
because it's easy and it is a perfectly

00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:27,019
fantastic first project this is one of

00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:29,149
the comments from the old raspbmc page

00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:30,289
about from this guy who's like I don't

00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:31,549
know what I was doing but it took me

00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:33,049
three minutes and now I've done it and

00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:34,639
this guy used to be my perfect example

00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:36,379
of how easy this was for a starter

00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:38,749
project and then we were trying to get

00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:40,700
the book finished and I told my then

00:31:38,749 --> 00:31:42,080
seven-year-old like here go do this and

00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,839
I will write down what you do and she

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,119
did it so the seven-year-old can do it

00:31:44,839 --> 00:31:48,950
I'm pretty sure you can or if you need a

00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:51,320
more complicated project in your life

00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:53,419
it's been sent here by chance

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:54,679
know so there's a guy walking around

00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:55,729
this conference I was hoping he was kind

00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:57,409
of gonna come so that I could tell this

00:31:55,729 --> 00:32:02,450
story about him while he was here but

00:31:57,409 --> 00:32:04,729
yes I was just here last night so we

00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:06,919
have a sorted mailing list at Red Hat

00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:09,679
for each of the offices and he sent a

00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,200
mail an email to our regional list one

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,749
day that said hey anybody a Geiger

00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,179
counter I could borrow over the weekend

00:32:13,749 --> 00:32:19,269
with no context at Red Hat that's a

00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:21,679
little bit of a disturbing thought and

00:32:19,269 --> 00:32:23,989
yet not the strangest requests we've

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,729
gotten over that list knew and so I just

00:32:23,989 --> 00:32:28,639
messaged him on IRC since I knew him and

00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:30,559
I was like which dude and he goes oh

00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:32,509
great can you make me a Raspberry Pi

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:34,580
Geiger counter and I'm like I don't

00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:37,159
think so but I want to Google that oh

00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,769
maybe I could that apparently is an

00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:42,080
option and then after the Fukushima

00:32:39,769 --> 00:32:44,210
disaster this actually became a huge

00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,070
thing and really important and some

00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,690
people got together and started creating

00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,369
these Raspberry Pi Geiger counters which

00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,769
are very inexpensive this is a module

00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:55,039
specifically made for this purpose

00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:56,779
called the the PI guy and the people who

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,639
created this had effectively no

00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:00,440
knowledge in the relevant technical

00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:02,570
areas and managed to get this running in

00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,879
about ten days and so then what you can

00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,499
do is gather research gather data and

00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:08,149
aggregate that and get some really

00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:09,529
important information that in the case

00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:12,440
of Fukushima they weren't getting out of

00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:14,299
the government or anyone else less

00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,859
seriously let's talk about the PI's

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,479
actual purpose who knows what this thing

00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:18,420
is

00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:24,750
anyone

00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:26,910
no oh well that's because you're all

00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:31,500
American this is the BBC micro which

00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:33,180
came out in 1981 December of 1981 and it

00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,940
came out in two models they were called

00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:37,440
the model a and the model B that should

00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,160
sound pretty familiar

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,130
what is slightly different is that the

00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:48,600
model a had a two megahertz processor in

00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:50,610
16k of RAM the B had a whopping 32k it

00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,530
was blazing but you can see my big red

00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,540
arrow it was intended for education and

00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:56,070
that was the whole that was the

00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:57,450
motivation and inspiration for the pie

00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:59,310
and so that's why it's named it the same

00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:02,100
way so let's talk about some education

00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:03,750
projects highs are increasingly being

00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,850
used in education there's the foundation

00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,320
has a raspberry pie education fund now

00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:10,140
that has been doing some good work

00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,970
Google funded 15,000 raspberry pies to

00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:13,169
be used in schools in the UK and that

00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:16,679
project is going really well

00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:19,649
Madonn U is a project in India and in

00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,450
Kenya from a start-up in the UK that

00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:22,860
takes PI education there but instead of

00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:24,120
dropping off a bunch of hardware and

00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:25,890
hoping that some kids learn something

00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,510
somewhere along the way they go in and

00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:28,950
teach all the classes and follow up and

00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,140
and do all of that and then there are

00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:33,450
gobs and gobs of local clubs and classes

00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:34,740
we went to an elementary school near us

00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:37,290
where the he was third and fourth

00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:38,700
graders the teacher got a grant to buy a

00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:40,169
bunch of pies and teach a semester-long

00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,550
class to the third and fourth graders

00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:46,050
about doing stuff with the Raspberry Pi

00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:47,850
PI's run scratch extremely well and so

00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:49,649
there are fantastic learning platforms

00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:51,300
for students to be able to learn scratch

00:34:49,649 --> 00:34:54,390
and then also to use it to build sweet

00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:55,890
robots this is another one this is a

00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:57,840
group called powering potential that

00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:59,400
began with three schools running

00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,500
solar-powered Raspberry Pi labs in

00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,150
Tanzania because they you know they

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:05,430
don't have a bunch of wall outlets to go

00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,200
plug all their pies into so they have a

00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:09,630
really fascinating setup and what they

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,880
have now is nine solar powered systems

00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:15,030
in 91 computers and ten schools around

00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,310
Tanzania teaching 5500 teachers and

00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:19,680
students and they started about two

00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:21,270
years ago I think and now have four

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,800
students who have gone on to be enrolled

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:25,500
in college to get bachelor's degrees in

00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,660
computer science and this was this was

00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,090
in 2013 but this is just after their

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,530
phase one of getting started the

00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:32,200
difference in the number of students who

00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:36,309
are qualified

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,920
to continue their education do you wanna

00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:39,940
talk about the RIT class sure so one of

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,920
the schools that Red Hat partners with

00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,390
to promote open source in general is the

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,970
Rochester Institute of Technology RIT

00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,530
and New York and one of the things

00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:50,109
they've created is they've created in an

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:52,180
advanced seminar course around free and

00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:53,710
open source software specifically around

00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,630
the Raspberry Pi so that each student

00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:57,339
gets a Raspberry Pi for the semester

00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:58,660
and then they work they basically

00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:00,700
develop a net new software that's

00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,799
interesting for the Raspberry Pi they

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,299
specifically focus on humanitarian free

00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:06,339
and open source software to try to write

00:36:04,299 --> 00:36:08,200
tools and games and educational

00:36:06,339 --> 00:36:10,329
applications that will make the world a

00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,829
better place and then they have a proper

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:14,680
release cycle they focus on shipping

00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:17,049
code releasing early and often and a

00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:19,270
semester they release about 20 projects

00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:20,500
and they put all that code up on github

00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,480
so other people can then take them and

00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,710
run with them and these are a few of the

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,260
projects that have come out of the class

00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:28,089
there's this one has a Python web app

00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,000
that displays the temperature from USB

00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:32,829
device that it shows you in colors and

00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,500
you can do various things with this is

00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:37,030
it reminds me if you've ever seen think

00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,530
excels the little kitty ears that you

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:40,180
should brain waves to do things it

00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,819
reminds me of that but it's it's called

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,230
the Nero PI and it's it goes along with

00:36:42,819 --> 00:36:46,030
a game where you keep a leaf a float

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,730
based on basically thinking about the

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:50,619
leaf it's kind of crazy bark tracker was

00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:53,200
the guy wanted to know if his dog was

00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:55,119
barking while he was at home so and then

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,880
it would eval him he says it's a crude

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,740
security system the dog is barking Tom

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,450
mentioned scratch and this is one of my

00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:03,430
favorite books for teaching kids scratch

00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:05,200
and and you know the Raspberry Pi is a

00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,760
great way to do that it's called super

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,829
Scratch programming adventure and it's

00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,920
in its second version now the way it

00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:13,450
works is the left side of each spread is

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,760
a comic book and the cat if you're

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,920
familiar with scratch that cat over on

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,230
the middle is the mascot of scratch and

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,730
you can make him do crazy things the cat

00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,839
is in peril or something is happening

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:24,760
the cat and then on the right side of

00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:26,470
the page and teaches you how to create a

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,970
program to solve the cat's problems and

00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:29,470
at the end of the book you've made a

00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:31,359
video game that you can play and that's

00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,920
really satisfying for kids and they have

00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,930
something today have done that's that's

00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,130
huge more than a book that just teaches

00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:37,859
you some concepts and you don't have

00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:39,910
anything to show for it at the end

00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,319
there's also if you have kids who are

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,240
slightly older there's a great book this

00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:44,980
is by no starch press there's when they

00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,890
have called Python for kids and several

00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,100
others in that series

00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:50,840
that are really great and then once you

00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,640
or your child that you are teaching has

00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,620
created awesome things you can go stored

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,590
out Raspberry Pi comm is powered by

00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,240
indie city and so it lets you share your

00:37:57,590 --> 00:38:00,920
stuff you can put a price on it if you

00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,580
want to be selling it but this is also a

00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,660
good way to sort of give some kids some

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,610
internet skills because it works like a

00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,170
lot of other places do where it tells

00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:11,810
you a little bit about the content like

00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:14,000
it'll tell you what the violence is or

00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:16,760
or whether there's one I saw that was

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,020
good for people with hearing problems

00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,970
and it shows that in the icons that are

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,170
content rating and then it tells you the

00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:22,400
license and so that gives you an

00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,800
opportunity to talk to kids about

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,480
various licenses mysteriously this one

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,470
has smart custom agreement and all it is

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,880
is GPL I don't know how that is custom

00:38:29,470 --> 00:38:34,430
and it's chocolate doom and I like that

00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,900
name there's another great one called

00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:37,460
Google coder and that's actually what's

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,890
on the SD card that I pulled out of my

00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,380
pocket this you install on your

00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,870
Raspberry Pi and it turns your pie into

00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,640
sort of a web server and then you open

00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:48,620
up Chrome on your laptop or whatever and

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:51,140
go to a coder dot local and this is what

00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:52,820
you see initially and gadget ID is sort

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,710
of like the old asteroids game and I'll

00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,880
show you a picture of that eyeball is

00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:57,200
the thing where you have an eyeball that

00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,940
follows your mouse around the screen and

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,290
hello coder gives you an introduction to

00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:02,210
all the sections of Google coder but

00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:05,500
what Google coder does is teach you

00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:08,630
basic HTML and JavaScript and no js' and

00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,890
CSS and the plus one is where you can

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,080
just start from scratch and create your

00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:14,060
own so you can go into this is gadget

00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,130
IDE and you can see this and you can

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,120
start with well I'll edit some variables

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:21,290
I want to see ten rocks and I want to

00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,370
name my ship something and I want to

00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:23,870
make them faster and you can see how

00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,280
editing variables works and then you can

00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:26,930
go to the next level and you can see all

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,270
of the code and change more things or

00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:32,660
you can start from scratch and do

00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:34,220
whatever you want and now there's a

00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:35,630
section called coder projects where

00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,920
people share things that they've done or

00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,260
you can go download these look at the

00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:41,600
code the little colored squares is a

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,760
music project there's a penguin game the

00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:46,160
bottom left is a thing to help you make

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,870
your own webcomic and the peanut butter

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,220
and jelly sandwich is a recipe system

00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:53,630
but I thought of when you were talking

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:55,040
about your kitchen scale yeah and these

00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,240
are just a few resources if you would

00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,490
like to get more involved with the PI's

00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,810
in education there are curriculum

00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,090
materials online there are

00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:03,590
about what projects you should be doing

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,400
with kids if you have a whole classroom

00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:08,630
of kids for it versus one kid this is

00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,740
the first thing I wanted to make though

00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:11,060
and now is the part where we talk about

00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,200
fun stuff and so serious things like

00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,510
Geiger counters and teaching children

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,970
things I looked up that thing and I said

00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,400
I have two game boys at home I think I

00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,600
could gut one and cram a Raspberry Pi in

00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,190
there it was slightly more complicated

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:24,710
than I thought but what this does

00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:26,300
demonstrate rather well is I mentioned

00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:28,490
that the PI is often tolerant of your

00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:31,160
stupidity and the PI was highly tolerant

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:32,630
of my stupidity this is a little TFT

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:34,250
screen that we bought from Adafruit a

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,710
long long time ago now like two years

00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:38,450
ago now I don't know and at the time now

00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:40,520
it's well documented at the time there

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,470
was not no schematic no information it

00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:45,050
was here's your screen good luck with

00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:47,900
that have a nice day and as you can see

00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:49,460
I am using the highly technical method

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:50,960
of connecting to the GPIO which is

00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,010
itty-bitty alligator clips and I stood

00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,140
over it to make sure nothing was

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,180
touching anything else and I played

00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:58,250
Tetris on it for a while it turns out

00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:01,310
now that that screen actually requires

00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:06,920
12 volts and not whatever power it can

00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:09,020
suck out of the GPIO pi is tolerant of

00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:11,600
your stupidity requires a such a loose

00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,110
word yeah I like finger quotes very

00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:14,000
helpful

00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:16,760
many people have since gone on to

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,200
accomplish this and this is the gutted

00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,090
version but he actually has crammed it

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,100
all in there there are many pies out

00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,240
there but we like to play video games of

00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,010
their pies actually we just like to play

00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,180
video games Zoey so I thought I'd show

00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,350
you a whole bunch more ways that you can

00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:28,820
play a bit be playing video games

00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:33,020
besides trying to cram all that back

00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:34,610
into a big Gameboy case this one oh

00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,930
sorry this isn't actually for playing

00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,220
games is for dressing up like you're

00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,230
playing games if you're familiar with

00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:41,090
fallout this guy looked at the pine said

00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,140
that would go on my arm I don't think it

00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:43,730
would go on my arm because I have any

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,480
bitty bird arms but it would go on a

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:49,220
normal adult person's arm and so he

00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,450
built it and it was awesome and then it

00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,280
broke the night it was a Halloween party

00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:53,690
which makes me very sad but he does have

00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,130
instructions on how he built the whole

00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:57,530
thing if you two would like to dress up

00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,520
in a fallout costume and I didn't

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,170
realize like we gave this presentation

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,220
for a really long time before in the

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,450
middle of the talk one day I realized

00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:08,860
that was a vodka bottle and not a beer

00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:12,830
bottle and now all of you noticed two

00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:14,210
so I love the games that I grew up with

00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:17,570
a lot more than I love a lot of the

00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:18,560
games that are coming out now so one of

00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,240
the things I wanted to do with the PI

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,920
was to really run emulators on it to be

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,140
able to emulate old-school games on the

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,300
platforms that I grew up with and

00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:28,130
because it's a lot easier than paying

00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:31,970
the money to get an Super Nintendo off

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:33,830
of ebay so I does a fantastic job of

00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:36,020
emulating it can emulate all the way up

00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,570
to the PlayStation 2 reasonably well for

00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:40,250
most games and part of that is that

00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:41,630
there's a lot of really insanely smart

00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:43,370
people in the emulator community that

00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,330
have written armed optimized versions of

00:42:43,370 --> 00:42:51,490
the emulators for the PI so if you are

00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:54,080
looking for games I cannot help you and

00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:55,460
but but the emulators are all out there

00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,390
they're all open source they're pretty

00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,800
straightforward there's a couple of

00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:59,540
distributions like pi MAME that are

00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:01,010
specifically around emulating old arcade

00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,510
machines that have a lot of the other

00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:05,420
emulators combined into it some of the

00:43:02,510 --> 00:43:07,250
PMC distributions have that in there but

00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:08,630
it's pretty straightforward and there's

00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,980
a lot of really cool things you can do

00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,570
there's a lot of people that are taking

00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,460
the old controllers converting them to

00:43:11,570 --> 00:43:15,410
USB joysticks and then you can plug them

00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,120
in and get that full experience so here

00:43:15,410 --> 00:43:19,340
a few of them this is an itty-bitty one

00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:22,160
if you see the not a banana but a

00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:24,110
lighter for scale he this actually

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,740
requires that you cut the pie up and

00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:29,870
cram it into this itty bitty case this

00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,880
is the diagrams he gives on his website

00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:35,930
to teach you how to do it so I love that

00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:38,030
he shares more people should share in

00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,320
the napkin fashion what good is a

00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:44,030
project if it doesn't include a step

00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:45,470
that says cut here carefully this is my

00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:46,280
favorite I call it the Pizza Hut table

00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,540
because that's the only place I ever

00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,340
used to see him where you have the the

00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:51,050
table that switches back and forth IKEA

00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,780
is the land of materials for this

00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:57,950
project this is a newer one that lights

00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:59,090
up that came back this is the cup Kate

00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:01,100
if you were lazy and would just like to

00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:04,070
pee - free $120 to mail you a kit so

00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:08,330
that you can do this and this is

00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:11,150
something newer slightly does a steam

00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:14,810
box on on the pie what they're actually

00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:17,060
doing is using Nvidia's game stream to

00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:20,870
stream PC games as long as you happen to

00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:21,940
have an NVIDIA GTX 680 force experience

00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,289
installed

00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:24,789
and so basically they're using a set of

00:44:23,289 --> 00:44:26,230
an Nvidia shield and if you go watch the

00:44:24,789 --> 00:44:27,160
whole video I mean it actually is pretty

00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,470
cool but if you watch a little video

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,119
periodically they say things like people

00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:33,339
are watching this and going that cost

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,809
$35 and I have to use the command line

00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:38,289
or I could just pay 50 for the one from

00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:39,940
Steam okay but it is an option because

00:44:38,289 --> 00:44:41,289
sometimes you just build things because

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,880
you wanted to build them and not because

00:44:41,289 --> 00:44:44,260
it was actually a good idea we have

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,700
built many things that weren't actually

00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,960
a good idea there's the Internet of this

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:53,920
full of people who have built things out

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:55,539
of raspberry pies they're not yeah you

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,950
at least seen one in Toy Story and the

00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:58,299
things a little bit creepy right this is

00:44:56,950 --> 00:45:00,640
what it looks like when you got it and

00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:03,609
crave a Raspberry Pi in it I like the

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,289
eyes yeah and and so as I mentioned it's

00:45:03,609 --> 00:45:07,089
a little creepy so what this does it's

00:45:05,289 --> 00:45:08,410
the fisher-price chatter telephone and

00:45:07,089 --> 00:45:09,700
he turned it to a smartphone he actually

00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:11,740
did a lot of this work with google coder

00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:13,930
which I showed you earlier and it does

00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,460
an assortment of things it uses the all

00:45:13,930 --> 00:45:17,170
the original buttons on the phone and

00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:18,549
it's connected to Twitter and Rotten

00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,230
Tomatoes and the weather and will tell

00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,970
him all sorts of things it does push

00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:23,740
notifications when he leaves the office

00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:25,720
and hasn't a really creepy voice that

00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:29,140
he's left Sunshine Academy or whatever

00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:30,520
the thing isn't and we'll play NPR BBC

00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,049
stream so I'm really hoping that you

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,869
were you guys able to hear the other

00:45:32,049 --> 00:45:36,220
video now okay so I'm really hoping that

00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:59,650
you can hear this because it's super

00:45:36,220 --> 00:46:01,420
creepy I like this guy I'm gonna hang

00:45:59,650 --> 00:46:03,039
out with him instead I'm gonna hang out

00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,079
with this guy and the guy with the vodka

00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:12,010
and the pip-boy so he led to the pines

00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:15,760
and put together a flux capacitor and

00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:16,900
yeah not sure it's actually what we

00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,520
would describe as functional and yet

00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:21,279
still really cool because we all like

00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:22,990
things that light up right in more

00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:24,670
practical projects many people have put

00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:27,339
the PI to use for home automation

00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:28,599
projects and this one what what made me

00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:30,309
laugh when I found this one is it was

00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:32,380
actually inspired by the same purpose as

00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:34,000
the kid at RIT where this guy wanted he

00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,010
bought a new dog and he was really sad

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,290
that he was home all the time so

00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,480
he wanted to check in on his dog and let

00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:41,590
find out when the dog was barking my

00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,780
favorite part of the home automation

00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,000
diagram here is the dog poop mapper

00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,860
where he where he literally straps the

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,700
sensor to the dog's collar to detect

00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:53,980
when the dog is doing this he does track

00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:56,890
the dog's location when she's on google

00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,240
maps and maps where he poops he also

00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,620
gets notifications for all the house

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,060
events the washer and dryer when the

00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:04,060
fire alarm goes off if there's a water

00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:06,190
leak door sensors window sensors the

00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:08,380
whole deal and it connects through

00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:12,220
arduino x' and a piece of software

00:47:08,380 --> 00:47:15,640
called open hav open hat org that runs

00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:17,470
on the pi it actually but this is the

00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,230
the app that he interfaces with which is

00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:22,360
pretty cool I however really like this

00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:23,680
guy's version of home automation which

00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:27,400
actually has all of the appropriate

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,900
sounds because uh yeah because I like

00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:31,660
Star Trek so if I'm gonna automate my

00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:32,430
house I want to feel like I live in the

00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:39,300
future

00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:41,860
also I don't have a dog yeah yeah like

00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:43,360
Windows 95 you could like put up your

00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:45,430
wallpaper so that you kind of felt like

00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:50,920
you had no cars interface but it didn't

00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:52,600
actually do anything not awesome my

00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,240
house I would also like to automate the

00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,980
appearance of coffee before me the only

00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:01,330
shortcoming in this project is that

00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:03,160
while he can dial up his coffee and then

00:48:01,330 --> 00:48:05,110
it goes off and makes a coffee it does

00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,970
not pick up the coffee glass and deliver

00:48:05,110 --> 00:48:09,340
it to me and I feel that's really a

00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,660
shortcoming in this project I think that

00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:12,700
would involve a lot of burns in the

00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,470
testing phase at the end of the day

00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:16,060
though I need my Raspberry Pi to bring

00:48:14,470 --> 00:48:19,210
me a beer or at least monitor the

00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:21,130
homebrew or any of you home brewers okay

00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,360
so those three of you this is a super

00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:24,520
cool system it keeps the temperature

00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,340
stable in your refrigerator to within

00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:28,810
0.1 degrees Celsius and so then you can

00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,220
even set up a system over the time of

00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:31,620
your brew for those of you are not home

00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:33,610
brewers yeast is really sensitive

00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:36,160
especially to sudden changes in

00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:38,170
temperature and so just instantly

00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,940
changing you know I'll just throw a

00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,590
little warm up so you can give it a

00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,240
whole temperature profile you can say my

00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:45,640
yeast is starting and so I wanted to

00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,740
spend 36 hours at 20 degrees Celsius and

00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:49,809
then you can say oh no fermentation

00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,719
slowed I'm gonna drop it to 17 degrees

00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:54,459
few days and then you can say slowly is

00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,259
it back up to you over the next five

00:48:54,459 --> 00:49:00,579
days and then you can give it a cold

00:48:56,259 --> 00:49:04,059
crash at the end it's a great system how

00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:06,999
much you had the ala mode so this is the

00:49:04,059 --> 00:49:09,609
ala mode this is was a lot more useful

00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:11,109
when there is less of community built up

00:49:09,609 --> 00:49:12,759
around Raspberry Pi because what this

00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:14,529
does is help you attach all of those

00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:16,359
Arduino shields that you already had in

00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:19,539
your drawer to your ass berry pie and

00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:20,709
that it's called a la mode there are

00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:22,569
other ones that are called less clever

00:49:20,709 --> 00:49:25,150
things like Arduino on your Raspberry Pi

00:49:22,569 --> 00:49:26,949
and that's what it looks like when you

00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:28,029
attach the shield and it just goes all

00:49:26,949 --> 00:49:32,380
straight down through those handy-dandy

00:49:28,029 --> 00:49:33,939
GPIO this is the thing over there by the

00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:36,209
wall that I do not know why it's not

00:49:33,939 --> 00:49:40,209
working do we know why it's not working

00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:43,089
they say it again doesn't like to raise

00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:45,579
his hand put that together first and it

00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:47,589
does things it that specifically only

00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:55,869
controls for and does not do this but

00:49:47,589 --> 00:49:57,130
you could theoretically well if you

00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:00,749
heard sound you would hear the Star Wars

00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:00,749
music right now and it would be awesome

00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:07,420
yeah that's what would happen and you

00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:09,849
could enhance your christmas-light

00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:12,039
experience with a project called pi fm

00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:13,359
yeah so essentially some very clever

00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:15,880
people figured out that by modulating

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:17,469
the frequency of the actual chip inside

00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:21,459
of the Raspberry Pi they could turn the

00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:23,499
PI into an FM transmitter basically by

00:50:21,459 --> 00:50:25,299
adding a wire to one of the GPIO pins

00:50:23,499 --> 00:50:26,589
very small local what you actually have

00:50:25,299 --> 00:50:28,179
to add the wire if you would like to

00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:31,449
expand it to it's about 50 meters it's

00:50:28,179 --> 00:50:33,160
not broadcasting far yeah and and it is

00:50:31,449 --> 00:50:34,539
important that we note here that this

00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,630
may or may not be legal in your

00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:39,759
jurisdiction and and and we do not wish

00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:42,039
to make any of the local amateur radio

00:50:39,759 --> 00:50:46,029
enthusiasts angry in any meaningful way

00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:47,499
so but if you wanted to turn your PI

00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:48,789
into a neat little broadcaster say

00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:50,019
you're in real estate you want to be

00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:51,789
able to have people drive by a house

00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:53,289
that's for sale and see in here a little

00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:54,579
message about what the house has in it

00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:56,019
and this is the fact that's the way to

00:50:54,579 --> 00:50:57,249
do that that sounds practical and not

00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,900
like a way to I know your neighbors I'm

00:50:57,249 --> 00:51:00,069
sorry you should hide one of these in

00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,900
their house and tune in to their

00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:03,040
favorite radio station so it overpowers

00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:06,300
it so that you can

00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,300
subliminal messages emit their brain

00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:17,770
never because this guy created this

00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:20,020
functional r2 unit but it is bilingual

00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:22,540
it accepts commands in English and

00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:23,770
Japanese and plays videos and does all

00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,390
of the sorts of things that you would

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,530
expect an r2 unit to do and the reason I

00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,790
called the best Valentine ever is

00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:30,150
because then his girlfriend became his

00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:32,440
wife and so clearly it worked

00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:33,940
if only he would bring me coffee also

00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:36,810
she keeps threatening to replace me

00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:39,550
without at work so this is fish pie and

00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:41,050
the people who are working on the fish

00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:42,220
pie Project wanted to be able to send

00:51:41,050 --> 00:51:44,530
their asbury pie out to gather

00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:45,790
scientific data and knew that they would

00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,580
have to build the most complicated

00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:50,110
advanced technologically waterproof boat

00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:51,460
that they could okay it's a Tupperware

00:51:50,110 --> 00:51:54,910
container attached to a small plastic

00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:58,660
boat but the idea is sound and they were

00:51:54,910 --> 00:52:00,850
able to use this approach to basically

00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:05,590
send out a pie into the ocean and a lot

00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:08,980
of so the project had a little like

00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:11,290
project sometimes the goal is to get it

00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:13,960
across the Atlantic unaided which is a

00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:15,640
lofty goal and they have just now gotten

00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,150
back together and gone this is the year

00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:20,380
2015 is the year for the fish pie but if

00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:21,970
you would like to build something

00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,410
waterproof and Tupperware is not the

00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:26,740
sort of thing you like to do and you're

00:52:23,410 --> 00:52:28,750
Tom you go hardcore that isn't backed

00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:30,100
pie in water yes so you just throw your

00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:31,420
pie in a bucket of water huge not

00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:33,340
kidding you can actually do that that'll

00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,260
short out but what you can do is you can

00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,610
get a paint from your local hardware

00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,520
store like your Home Depot or Lowe's

00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:42,610
called never wet it 3m made the paint

00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:44,380
rust-oleum resells it I if you go to the

00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:45,880
website for this paint it talks about

00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,950
how hydrophobic it is and how it

00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,750
actually repels water from it and then

00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:52,630
in the FAQ the first question is is can

00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:57,300
I do this to electronics and they say no

00:52:52,630 --> 00:52:57,300
don't let that stop you

00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,860
if you do any of you have our book it

00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:05,180
does it not frequently say this is a

00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,090
dumb idea but you should probably do it

00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:09,470
anyway variations on that theme yeah and

00:53:08,090 --> 00:53:11,030
you may visit the booth later and yell

00:53:09,470 --> 00:53:12,410
at Tom about vertical video that is an

00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:15,500
option that was that was the alternate

00:53:12,410 --> 00:53:17,620
title of our book we should do it anyway

00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:19,850
yeah they talk to that whole hack thing

00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:21,440
there are many awesome projects which

00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:23,840
take advantage of this cool thing your

00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,910
PI has a dedicated little port on it

00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:28,760
intended for this itty bitty camera it's

00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:30,470
about an inch ish or so and the thing

00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:31,700
under it is a blue filter that comes

00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:33,560
with the version called the pine waar

00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,680
which I will tell you about in a moment

00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:39,560
but it is a fantastic little five

00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:42,890
megapixel camera that will take 1080p

00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:45,320
h.264 video at 24 30 frames per second I

00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:46,550
think and we have used it for many fun

00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:48,470
projects this is actually the first

00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,910
thing we built the PI the very first

00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:51,920
thing that we built with the PI was

00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:53,690
photo booth where you could come to our

00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,940
booth for the fedora booth and you could

00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:57,830
get your picture taken with tux we would

00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:59,420
we had the camera set up on the remote

00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,710
with the PI on the monitor and so we

00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:03,080
would hit enter it would take a picture

00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:05,270
it would apply that picture to some

00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:07,220
image editing scripts that we wrote that

00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:09,110
will size it right put an outlet put a

00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,600
fedora logo on it upload it to the web

00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:13,820
you can give them Anna one of those QR

00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:15,530
codes so that they could get their

00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:16,910
picture later and then everyone pointed

00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:18,230
out that they could have just taken a

00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:20,300
picture with their cell phone and we

00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:21,590
felt dumb but that did not stop a whole

00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:23,240
bunch of people from coming to that

00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:24,440
booth repeatedly though but everybody

00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,090
everybody loved hanging out we talked

00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:31,280
both of us are in this picture right now

00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:34,670
I'm the guy that's the result you would

00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:39,980
get that preferably looking less like an

00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:41,780
angry Snape this is this is me in a

00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:45,020
funny suit because that's what we do we

00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:46,250
trade I build a lot of costumes some of

00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:48,170
them are so and some of them are made

00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,030
out of foam some of them are stranger

00:54:48,170 --> 00:54:51,350
than others and so one of the things

00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:52,910
that I really wanted to do is come up

00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:54,830
with a way to get the Raspberry Pi into

00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:56,690
a costume that actually required the

00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:57,980
Raspberry Pi that needed more than just

00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:59,660
an Arduino because lots and lots of

00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,670
Arduino is making things blink or

00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:04,880
something something that genuinely

00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:06,680
required the Raspberry Pi and we have we

00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,870
do one project in the book about how you

00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:10,070
can use that same little TFT screen I

00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,780
showed you to make

00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:13,700
sort of I got shot through effect it's

00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:15,290
the same idea of how they make visible

00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,790
things by having the camera facing

00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,680
backwards in the screen facing forward

00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:19,910
so you're seeing whatever's behind me

00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,620
and it looks like somebody shot through

00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:24,590
and yet I magically still walk but this

00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:26,240
is a sound wave sound wave transformer

00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:29,480
yeah nods of recognition

00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:31,130
well you guys have lunch comas and so

00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:33,920
Soundwave has one Raspberry Pi in the

00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:35,390
helmet and runs an LED scroll across the

00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:37,790
front that could say welcome to South

00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:40,370
East Linux fast or can rain little dots

00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:41,810
or whatever you would like it to do but

00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,670
the cool part is in the chest and you

00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:46,430
can see that little kid who is staring

00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:48,530
at my chest like little kids do because

00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:49,730
it does three things there are two

00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:51,260
buttons that are a little hard to see on

00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,580
the left side there's a yellow one and a

00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:54,200
black one under the yellow stripes and

00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,360
if you push the yellow and it plays a

00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:58,460
series of Transformers music videos

00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:01,670
which is a thing on the internet and you

00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:03,560
just loaded them and the black one plays

00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:04,910
the feed from the camera which you can

00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,500
kind of see it's blacked out above the

00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:08,330
yellow stripes and so you can take a

00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,880
picture of Soundwave well with a picture

00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:11,870
of you on it it's kind of fun I think

00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:13,760
that's what's happening in the picture

00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:14,960
on the Left I know that looks like a

00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,310
video game because the third thing you

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,870
can do is press that big red button in

00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:19,130
the thigh and there's a video game

00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:23,000
controller my Kerman you could play

00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:24,140
Donkey Kong on my chest kids like to

00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,820
stand there and play video and if

00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:27,830
they're meeting kids because when you're

00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,970
at ash - I've not suited up with

00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:30,890
something that covers your head like a

00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:32,930
penguin suit children are mean and they

00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:34,220
will punch you and so if you are a mean

00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:36,010
little kid and you want to play Donkey

00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:41,420
Kong on me I'm gonna start you in this

00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:42,500
it's a dance mood this is a project I

00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:45,560
said I tell you what that little blue

00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:49,010
filter is for in the pine waar so it is

00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:51,050
and for blue it is it is using that

00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:53,780
filter to show you infrared plus not

00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:55,700
blue the purpose of which is that it

00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,980
shows photosynthesis and so they can

00:56:55,700 --> 00:57:00,560
take the same series of pictures in an

00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:02,090
area over time and show where the

00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:06,950
photosynthesis is happening and in what

00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:08,360
areas may not be as healthy this is I'm

00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,920
gonna build one of these four Tom's so

00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:11,780
they quit asking me for a 3d scanner to

00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,100
go with this 3d printer yeah so somebody

00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,320
wanted to be able to build three scanner

00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:16,910
these can be really expensive to get

00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,310
high-resolution 3d scanners so he what

00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:21,620
he did was is he attached a lot of

00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:23,060
cameras to a lot of raspberry PI's in an

00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:23,780
array and wrote them together so that

00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,130
there was control

00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,690
software that would take the necessary

00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:28,730
amount of pictures in order to get a

00:57:26,690 --> 00:57:31,010
high-quality resolution in 3d model this

00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:34,160
particular one in the picture is running

00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:36,560
on 40 PI's with 40 cameras and a single

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,960
60 amp power supply to power them all

00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,460
the original version he only used 12 so

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,200
he says you can do it especially if you

00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,330
only want to scan the front of somebody

00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,580
you don't want a 360 you can do it with

00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:48,830
far less they also now have one that

00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:50,060
uses a hundred PI's and a hundred

00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,860
cameras and all the equipment to set

00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,960
that up cost eighty five hundred euros I

00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:56,450
did the math and the 12-1 was only about

00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,740
a thousand dollars so it's still not a

00:57:56,450 --> 00:57:59,810
cheap solution but if you want to go

00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:03,110
about 3d scanning people it is totally

00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:05,420
an option this is if you once you have

00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:06,770
Wade and all of the things for your pie

00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:08,480
that you were gonna make your Raspberry

00:58:06,770 --> 00:58:10,670
Pi in your kitchen you can use the PI

00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,680
microwave it's a fake your Raspberry Pi

00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:14,240
I don't think you should bake pies in a

00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:17,270
microwave I think that's what ovens are

00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,430
for and yet it's an option and this is

00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:21,290
inspired by a reddit thread titled food

00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:23,450
items that should have QR codes that

00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:25,880
tell the microwave what to do and so

00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:28,010
that's exactly what he did he that's the

00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:30,350
Twitter he built this database that uses

00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:33,140
the UPC code and so you scan it and it

00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:35,210
says hot pocket and the pie bakes your

00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:41,870
hot pocket for you and then it sweets to

00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:42,980
tell you I made a hot pocket and this is

00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:45,200
the project that I want you to build me

00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:48,730
can you get on this this is the the

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:52,460
magic mirror and what it does is you

00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:54,560
behind it a pretty fantastically

00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,810
detailed project every direction is

00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:58,970
online and so there then people have

00:58:56,810 --> 00:59:00,380
been building them over again and then

00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:00,710
you can have it display whatever you

00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:02,690
want

00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:03,920
I really handsome that's a good way to

00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:07,070
wake up in the morning when you look up

00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,480
in the mirror and so that's about it

00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:10,610
this is a bunch of resources that we've

00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:15,860
recommended and I will have all these

00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:19,250
slides online if not at the you can see

00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:21,230
lead-off adorable org and there's a

00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:24,800
raspy folder there and you can get them

00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:26,480
all and that's how to find us and we are

00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:30,680
generally friendly and will answer your

00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,960
questions do you have any questions do

00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:36,190
you have any questions did you all have

00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,190
Bojangles for lunch and fall asleep

00:59:42,839 --> 00:59:52,470
you had some ZigBee didn't you Eston

00:59:55,140 --> 01:00:03,009
okay ZigBee pie yes it works there's a

01:00:02,049 --> 01:00:05,140
lot of libraries out there for it

01:00:03,009 --> 01:00:07,779
especially if you're buying from someone

01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:10,960
like a deferred or sparkfun there are

01:00:07,779 --> 01:00:12,759
specific implementations Linux ZigBee is

01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,619
reasonably well supported and that's the

01:00:12,759 --> 01:00:16,150
main thing you need to be able to use a

01:00:14,619 --> 01:00:18,789
lot of the guides that are written for

01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:48,309
Arduino will work just as well for pi so

01:00:18,789 --> 01:00:49,869
yeah totally works he suggested perhaps

01:00:48,309 --> 01:00:51,279
a bit tongue-in-cheek that he would go

01:00:49,869 --> 01:00:52,779
through he has a lot of projects that

01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:56,640
use pies and it would be nice if Amazon

01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:56,640
had a subscription and we support this

01:01:12,329 --> 01:01:24,099
so for the video the the website is our

01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:25,809
s u e h l e dot fedora people dot orgy

01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:29,700
and that's her website and there's lots

01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:29,700
of good talks there including this one

01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:38,800
[Music]

01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:46,869
or so what he said was is that if you

01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:48,160
have the lovely program which includes

01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,809
the ad and the code for the free

01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:56,170
O'Reilly book our book is one of the

01:01:49,809 --> 01:01:57,609
free books you can get get our book and

01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:58,930
if you have a book with you and you want

01:01:57,609 --> 01:02:00,069
us to sign it will sign it unfortunately

01:01:58,930 --> 01:02:01,390
we don't have any books to give away but

01:02:00,069 --> 01:02:08,640
if you have one already we'll be happy

01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:08,640
to sign it for you thank you

01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,960
you

01:02:54,380 --> 01:04:49,830
[Music]

01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:51,420
your customers rely on your website or

01:04:49,830 --> 01:04:53,850
application if it's slower

01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:56,880
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:58,740
and costs you money keeping your

01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,309
business critical systems humming along

01:04:58,740 --> 01:05:05,039
requires insight into what they're doing

01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:07,049
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,269
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:05:07,049 --> 01:05:11,579
resource limitations and other problems

01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:13,680
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:15,989
your systems performance metrics in real

01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:18,869

hood the long view dashboard lets you

01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:26,999
visualize the status of all your systems

01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:53,939
while the process Explorer displays

01:05:51,749 --> 01:05:56,519
usage statistics for individual

01:05:53,939 --> 01:05:58,589
processes the system info tab shows

01:05:56,519 --> 01:06:00,959
listening services active connections

01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:03,089
and available updates adding longview to

01:06:00,959 --> 01:06:05,339
a system is easy just click the button

01:06:03,089 --> 01:06:06,959
copy the one-line installation command

01:06:05,339 --> 01:06:09,660
then run the command on your Linux

01:06:06,959 --> 01:06:11,519
system to complete the process the agent

01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:13,469
will begin collecting data and sending

01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:16,829
it to long view then the graphs start

01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:19,469
rolling use long view to gain visibility

01:06:16,829 --> 01:06:23,630
into your servers so when your website

01:06:19,469 --> 01:06:23,630
or app heats up it stays up

01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:35,860

citrix xenserver gives you everything

01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,680
you need to integrate manage and

01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:02,810
automate a virtual data center all on an

01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:05,180
enterprise class cloud proven virtual

01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:07,910
platform and at a third of the cost of

01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:09,740
other solutions but why even bother with

01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:10,820
virtualizing your server infrastructure

01:07:09,740 --> 01:07:12,710
in the first place

01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:14,600
well let's say you have a traditional

01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:16,550
one server to one application

01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,850
architecture but you're running out of

01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:20,930
resources and performance is suffering

01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:24,310
once you order new server hardware

01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:27,470
you'll wait for delivery configure it

01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:30,800
install your business application stage

01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:33,020
and test the server and finally add it

01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:35,000
to your production farm if you've been

01:07:33,020 --> 01:07:37,610
through this process before you know it

01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,830
can take weeks or even months you also

01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:41,660
know it's a manually intensive process

01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:44,900
that will burden your team every time

01:07:41,660 --> 01:07:46,700
you outgrow your current setup with the

01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:48,740
virtual server solution you could

01:07:46,700 --> 01:07:51,260
accomplish all of that in less than half

01:07:48,740 --> 01:07:53,930
a day server virtualization software

01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:56,390
separates the OS and application from

01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:58,250
the underlying server hardware and with

01:07:56,390 --> 01:08:00,350
multiple virtual machines on a single

01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:03,320
server you can use each of them to run

01:08:00,350 --> 01:08:05,120
different os's and applications this

01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,980
makes it possible to move your virtual

01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,380
machines from one piece of hardware to

01:08:06,980 --> 01:08:11,660
another whenever you want to maximize

01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:13,610
utilization simplify maintenance or

01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:15,920
recover from a hardware failure and

01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:18,859
without slowing down your applications

01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:21,920
or users clearly server virtualization

01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:24,950
provides big benefits and Citrix
