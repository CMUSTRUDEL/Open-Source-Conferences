alright well my name is Richard Gillette

00:00:05,149 --> 00:00:10,880
and i work at omni bond which is a

00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,790
software development company i'm here to

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,830
talk about a app that we have called

00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:19,970
Oslo's which is a social media

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:21,439
aggregator on pontiff way to get all

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,210
your social media feeds into one place

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,849
into a database and do some data metrics

00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:27,849
on them so I was going to start just by

00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:43,010
doing a rundown of the app so you can

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:46,219
log in with anyone of instagram google

00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,590
facebook twitter or linkedin currently

00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:50,059
and a federated Law going through them

00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,359
and will take you back to the app gives

00:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,640
you an authentication token which we use

00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,980
to authenticate calls on your behalf

00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:01,160
with their API is to get data and then

00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:06,259
put it in our database so we're not safe

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,270
password so this is the main feed all

00:01:06,259 --> 00:01:10,939
social media outlets have their own idea

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:13,009
of a scroller wall so we normalize all

00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:15,020
the different data into one standard

00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:17,630
activity object and then we query that

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,579
when we built our own kind of post

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:24,070
object we put it on the wall here so

00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:26,090
here you see Instagram and Facebook and

00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:28,100
point of just those two but we've

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,110
normalized the data so that it all looks

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,930
the same we give you a few options like

00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:35,630
you can favorite specific posts or you

00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,759
can favorite a person and this is

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:39,469
something that is nice about all solos

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,229
because you can't really do these things

00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:43,399
on your standard social media outlets

00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:46,430
like Facebook or Twitter you currently

00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,100
favored to go back and year because we

00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:51,950
save all the data locally you can do you

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:56,270
can add extra attributes to it like like

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:58,880
favoritings farm so because we save it

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,469
all into a database we index based on a

00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:06,130
few things like the title of the status

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:06,130
you can research

00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:18,780
not so with this searches the database

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,880
across all the indexes for all different

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,250
accounts and finds anything with the

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,480
word happy in it we tried to make it

00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:29,790
very Google esque so if you quote

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:31,980
something it'll do exact strong searches

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,280
if you do a user colon little search

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,500
specific keywords for a user which is

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,510
all exposed right here yeah so you can

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,010
search by service by user or you can

00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,600
search exactly for things like that we

00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,630
try to do inclusive and exclusive

00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,030
searches so you can pinpoint what

00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,940
exactly you're looking for from here

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,370
also we let you post to the specific

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,110
site so here you can reply and retweet

00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,560
and favorite which is you know for

00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,380
Twitter comment and like is for

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,660
Instagram we try to do whatever they can

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,310
do but of course all five of them work

00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:07,680
differently so we try to normalize them

00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,489
are one thing that we've added is

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,019
blasting where you can take a post and

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:14,550
shoot it to all other accounts that you

00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:19,140
have authenticated so this way you can

00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:24,090
take posts between accounts but I'm not

00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,340
going to do that so when you search you

00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,920
clone save custom feeds so here again

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:35,430
we'll search for a be when we can save

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:39,030
this and this goes when the custom feeds

00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,709
local feeds are your wall data from your

00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,500
friends in which you put on your

00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:45,120
accounts and public is what is called

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,040
the fire hose for the different social

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,410
media console you can go search twitter

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,090
facebook or google for the most trending

00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:54,120
topics for a word and save those feeds

00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,980
as well so local feeds here's the app

00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,970
you feedin knows everything we were just

00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,890
looking at all now i can jump over to

00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:07,019
query and these instead of being local

00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:10,310
to your phones are off the fire hose so

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:10,310
if we search happy on twitter

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,690
give it a second to search a few million

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:18,970
tweets and here's all of the currently

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:21,180
trending data for the word happy on

00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:25,650
Twitter and you can save these as well

00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:25,650
so this would be happy for you public

00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,310
you also have options to merge into your

00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:39,570
main feed if um so now we have public

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:42,310
custom feeds and local custom feeds um

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,979
let's see in data mining we get not only

00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:47,020
the posts but also the users as well so

00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,900
if you go to the people you can look for

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,229
the chattiest people alphabetic searches

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,820
for your users which one is this the

00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:57,910
most recent posters that people have

00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,500
talked most recently on friends of

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,669
friends which are people who you do not

00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,010
have in your friends list but who have

00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:04,419
commented on accounts that you are

00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,840
friends with so they're kind of second

00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:10,690
degree and then they'll just take you to

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,889
the specific data just for the people

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,450
they're here earlier i favored it and i

00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:18,400
like to post there's the post that i

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,050
favorited and you can also look at

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,349
favorite people and give you every post

00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:25,090
from that user that you have saved in

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:27,310
putting all the data into a data store

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:31,090
we can do analytics on it we use an

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:34,539
open-source JavaScript data visualizer

00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,220
and Grapher called d3 and they give you

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:41,110
a lot of really easy standard ones like

00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:43,150
generating word clouds for people or you

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,470
can do bar graphs for user data it

00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:47,139
really depends on how you feed the data

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,650
into it but here is the top 50 pair of

00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,300
this at the top 20 posters there's a

00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:53,830
game developer there's a stand-up

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:59,289
comedian so those are the people talk on

00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:01,840
the most you can also do grabs by

00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:03,250
service I have more Facebook people talk

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,650
on an Instagram so you can kinda get

00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,770
data metrics on your data pool once it

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,660
grows to a nice eyes much like blasting

00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,550
you can post as well so these are

00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,919
completely novel posts blasting is

00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:20,169
sharing these are how you would post

00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:22,230
between people but I'm not going to not

00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,940
want to pose here

00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,620
I'm suited the public query we give you

00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,890
a few settings to millage the app so

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,620
here you can add and remove new accounts

00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:34,450
so I can go here to look at all of my

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,690
authenticator two counts and relocate

00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:40,360
them and it shows you let's see Google's

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,580
token has expired Twitter's token is

00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,820
good until revoked facebook gives you

00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:49,000
token for six months Instagram is good

00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:50,950
until revoked you can also disable login

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,880
so only one person can login at a time

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,590
based on one account or you can go in

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,030
and add duplicates for other accounts to

00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,970
hear i could add a second facebook

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:04,450
prompt as long as I gave it a new color

00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,250
unlogged in with a different comp so you

00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,330
could support three Facebook's per one

00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,460
account and give them all different

00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,200
colors and manage pretty much all of

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,430
your all of your accounts to this app

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,790
here you can merge your contacts because

00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,660
usually you'll have friends and multiple

00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,580
services so I could have a friend in

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:24,130
facebook and front and Twitter and here

00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:26,590
i could click on the two of them merge

00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:28,390
contacts and this would basically merge

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:30,730
alphington post with whoever i clicked

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:33,460
on there you go non New York cartoons &

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,510
oven to pose for the same person or you

00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:39,820
can unmerge it if you don't want that

00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:45,090
anymore so you can kind of group all

00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:45,090
your phones together to manage the app

00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:55,840
no all right probably won't someone work

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:58,120
them there's ways to backup and download

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,870
your data all of these instances are

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:05,110
spun up on Amazon t2 micros so they have

00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:08,500
about 500 gig or 500 megs of ram maybe a

00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:10,030
gig or two of storage space so even

00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,410
though we're saving this all into JSON

00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:13,240
eventually you're going to run into

00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:16,330
space so here you can back it up into

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,700
JSON owned locally download the files

00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,530
deleted from the database you can also

00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,210
upload and restore those as well so you

00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,770
tryna moment your data you could always

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,140
spend this up on a larger node but the

00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:27,430
t2 micros are the free to your eligible

00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,320
ones so that's probably going to be

00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,090
cheap

00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,240
let's see what those and stuff since I

00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:37,880
was all settings and then help we have

00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,150
just one of a help page takes us right

00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,919
to us close here um tells you one of

00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,470
what I'm talking about how to how to use

00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:48,230
the app different walkthroughs that

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,490
we've done and there's some email links

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,050
on here you can always email with

00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:53,210
questions or comments and of course it's

00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,280
an open source project on github so you

00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,960
can go to github in search assa Lohse

00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,350
and it will come up and you can leave

00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,390
pull requests or for bug reports and

00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,480
then in our about page we use a few

00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:07,430
other open-source products like let's go

00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,070
of course get up we use elastic search

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,990
for our database the dojo framework is

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,090
what we are writing it in in the dojo

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:17,720
model framework developed by clemson is

00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:20,060
what the app structures in we as a few

00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,830
clones to help us log in and manage

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,260
count tokens with the social media

00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,600
clients of Twitter Abraham home use for

00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:29,450
twitter nerve tattoo as a client we used

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,280
to talk to elasticsearch d3 is the

00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,160
data-driven documents that we use to

00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:36,200
graph data analytics tabs there so we

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,920
just want to give you know a little link

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:46,510
to the site surfer people are using and

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:49,730
give them their due credit and really

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,500
that's the whole thing I don't really

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,040
know if I should turn it off like want

00:09:51,500 --> 00:10:00,140
to tick off what other stuff going to

00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,210
talk about that's pretty much it all of

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,980
its live data so giving talks like this

00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,300
is terrifying because you can't search

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:08,420
any words without getting into pro

00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:09,680
career results I clicked on Sharif a

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,070
second ago and three girls are on a

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,339
couch and I'm like ooh next next slide

00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:18,680
so currently I think the only two real

00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:20,480
bugs in it are linkedin is just a huge

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:21,800
bug luckily they've rolled back their

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,300
API so that's going to be removed

00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:25,880
because we're not paying the money for

00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:28,160
it and Facebook has changed a lot of the

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,980
permissions which I have a fix for but I

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,420
haven't pushed it to github yet but as

00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,450
the different social outlets change so

00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,890
does the code need to change with it on

00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:42,019
there's not really anyone developing

00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:43,790
this product anymore so it's slowly

00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,800
and it needs the community to support it

00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:51,199
so whoever I'm talking to right now go

00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:54,170
log on and fix it otherwise that's

00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:55,639
really it the post page is totally not

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,949
loading it should be like a whole thumb

00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:06,079
right here for does it load later oh

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:09,249
noes no it doesn't yeah should I inspect

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:15,549
the homeowners that tacky little pom-pom

00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:15,549
yes educational what's wrong with an f5

00:11:17,199 --> 00:11:25,069
get two moons worked for logo thinking

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,649
it's got the dome own one of the

00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:36,470
homework what's uh where's the console

00:11:27,649 --> 00:11:38,209
again in today to load nougat this is a

00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:42,189
problem would oh am i using a min ified

00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:42,189
version alright let's try the alone um

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:51,170
this might be the minified and this one

00:11:49,879 --> 00:12:01,069
might be the source the source might

00:11:51,170 --> 00:12:04,279
work better due to do in strong no no no

00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:05,839
moon will do either of you two phone

00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:08,079
people have any questions about the

00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,079
synthetic

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,750
favorites what was I doing one ghost

00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,980
yeah so there again it must be the

00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:23,250
difference the build must do something

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:27,380
to it so here's your file uploading and

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:31,440
choose a file here if they have any I

00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:33,750
don't know nothing and then you upload

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,090
and you can post now or you can post

00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,030
later so initially we develop this thing

00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,560
as a personal solution for I guess you

00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:43,140
know teenagers to manage all their

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,060
Twitter accounts or whatever but most of

00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,320
the interest has been businesses so

00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,510
we've been trying to tailor people

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,240
really like this feature because I guess

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,620
people like Hardy's and Carl's jr. have

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,900
non Twitter accounts that they need to

00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:57,090
manage and that's some poor guys job and

00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,800
this will make it a lot easier or lets

00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:00,150
you know be able to post something at

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,250
nine o'clock but not have to be there at

00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:09,800
nine o'clock so you can still keep your

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:09,800
hours post history oh word that's known

00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:17,640
nice so that's really it helps you

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,320
manage your people it's written in

00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,320
JavaScript the backbones PHP

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:33,510
