I'm on the sock for seniors cough all

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:13,719
right so this is open source creative

00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:16,480
production that's me begin to that in a

00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,779
moment wait hold on who goes there

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:24,460
that's me i am jason van dumpster I

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:26,259
wrote blunder for dummies again Bible

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,880
and I ran a small animation studio for

00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,279
eight years called ham turkey studios in

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,600
richmond virginia which I no longer live

00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:39,129
in I now live in Atlanta Georgia doing

00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,379
animation for currency anti-counterfeit

00:00:39,129 --> 00:00:42,579
technology it's the weirdest application

00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,890
of animation I've ever been involved

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:53,260
with probably not going to talk about

00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:54,850
that sorry it gets its it's so

00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:58,329
fascinating but I can't say a word about

00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,340
it incidentally throughout the entirety

00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,320
of this thing if you want to interrupt

00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:03,730
me ask questions throw things out insult

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,750
me I'm more than willing to play a game

00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:10,420
with its fun fantastic formal so quick

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:12,760
pause is anyone else in this room done

00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,100
any sort of creative stuff with free

00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:23,410
software I'm talking writing music video

00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:27,690
a what else is there 3d printing get

00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:31,060
code code counts does the code sing no

00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:39,250
can you sing what coding all right then

00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:41,170
that counts good later on if I'm running

00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,240
out of time if I'm if I blow through

00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:46,030
this and I have empty space I'm going to

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,780
ask you to sing so just putting that out

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:52,180
there all right so where where are the

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:55,450
open-source creative tools now the thing

00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:56,890
is it's I don't know if you've played

00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:00,730
with the years of all done something

00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:02,860
with it I've because I'm in the small

00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:04,510
studio for as long as I did I've kind of

00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,250
touched every facet I've touched print

00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:09,220
I've done illustration that done video

00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,860
3d just about any sort of facet of the

00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,890
creative process from concept all the

00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,110
way down a delivery I

00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:16,880
kind of done it so this is sort of my

00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,040
perspective um where where the toolset

00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,410
is and what's available out there and

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,660
the good news is that you can get from

00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,540
from point A to point B using nothing

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:29,750
but free software which is high end of

00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:31,430
exciting but so where are the tools now

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,770
we have workhorses this these are the

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,870
tools that that kind of all know exists

00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:37,840
or at least I think we all know they

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,190
exist so there's blender which is

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:46,030
gigantic thing I'll go into detail on

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:50,780
this escape game kreta audacity and VLC

00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:55,570
well so blender you guys familiar with

00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:55,570
blender yes oh good because I'd be sad

00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:01,760
free modeling animation it's kind of the

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,350
model of the mega beasts of creative

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,640
production stuff it does a bunch of

00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:06,110
things that's not even supposed to do

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,290
and then people use it for other things

00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:13,250
that they're probably not in the best

00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:14,870
place to use them for but it works great

00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:19,130
for it so everything from scientific

00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,480
visualization to architecture to fun fun

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:25,310
animations of pants that have been

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,420
ignited on the fire which might escape

00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:30,860
you guys have all played with that

00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:33,079
uh-huh I love it its way it's a vector

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:34,670
drawing application right so if you took

00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:37,220
comparing it to proprietary tools we're

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:41,510
talking illustrator freehand that kind

00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,920
of that ilk and I like the interface a

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,030
lot better this way and there's tools

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,290
not go into more of this in a stretch

00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:51,320
disregard the giant hideous eyeballs

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:53,630
there and i'll put the slides together

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:56,720
quickly give me a break here so [ __ ] we

00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:59,630
all know and kind of loathe a kind of

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,600
love [ __ ] for various reasons depending

00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:05,329
on who you talk to 2d raster graphics

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,140
fun stuff kreta how many people

00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:12,980
afflicted with kreta yeah sok rita was

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,959
originally born as a kind of a

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:16,970
competitive again kind of doing that but

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,459
their focus shifted and the primary

00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,660
interest now is on painting and digital

00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:23,880
illustration and those sort of things

00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:26,310
and it's fantastic the brush system is

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,470
is is something to behold interface

00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:29,610
sometimes doesn't respond as quickly as

00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:31,140
I would like you to but that's because

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:35,040
it can do so many cool and awesome

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:38,550
things so it's and the funny thing is

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,460
that people think kreta is a very young

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:43,530
prod product project and it's been

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,380
around for a while it's just the

00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,700
development of it has has sort of leaped

00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,840
forward along with all other reason

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:55,080
Kickstarter projects and stuff like that

00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:59,490
is good stuff audacity mmm the interface

00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:02,850
is hideous look at riots um how many

00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,740
people here have done or do like audio

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:07,200
editing podcasting that kind of stuff

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:08,490
and or reckon so and says hey I want to

00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,620
do a podcast was the first thing you say

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,640
is typically doesn't matter what you're

00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,380
using me use audacity right and that's

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:18,300
kind of where it is because for what it

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,890
does if you don't need anything really

00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,970
really extravagant this is fantastic and

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,650
for stuff even if you do need some

00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:28,500
extravagant things you can you can make

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:32,160
it work VLC I put this one in here

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:34,590
because it does so many more things than

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,270
just play video you guys all done all

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:40,350
the stupid crazy things you can do with

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:42,330
VLC from transcode to play video I think

00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:45,840
I saw somebody at it in the aunts not

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:48,420
going to recommend that one but so those

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,040
are those are the workhorses those are

00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,440
the tools if you're doing any sort of

00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,210
creative production creative making of

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,760
things using free and open source

00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:58,740
software chances are good you've at

00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:06,330
least been told about each and every one

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:10,140
of these things but you can do it an in

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:13,980
player um if you if you write I mean if

00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,990
you're if you're used to working more

00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:17,220
procedural if you're used to working on

00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,860
wonderful elements and what you need

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,200
automated min players were typically I

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,300
like an FF MPEG a little bit more for

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,810
that I actually do much screen screen

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:31,800
grabs for tutorials with ffmpeg but if

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,860
you're recommending it to somebody to do

00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,680
something you might take it you know go

00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:40,470
ahead and use the mouse and

00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,639
use VLC but the end again those those

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,000
are just the start that's just sort of

00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,169
the the workhorse set that's the

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,310
starting place everybody kind of is

00:06:46,169 --> 00:06:50,400
aware of those tools for those

00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,830
particular types of things there's more

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,880
so we've got stuff that we've got and

00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,560
I'm going to get into details on these

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,380
in a bit but writing a publishing

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,410
illustration video and post audio 3d

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:04,910
printing we're gonna go back cuz no I'll

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:07,289
type in the more detail you things so

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:08,819
scribus how many guys have messed with

00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:11,060
scribus I've done any sort of print

00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:14,849
layout and that sort of stuff scribus is

00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:17,550
actually kind of fantastic be there's

00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:21,030
some things way it handles texts makes

00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:28,050
me kind of want to choke a kitten

00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:32,039
sometimes uh this is live isn't ah sorry

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:34,319
kittens I describe this is great for

00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,289
actually for layout I actually laid out

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:42,030
I I wrote a book and self-published it

00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:44,159
and I laid it out using scribus from 365

00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:46,050
pages worth of stuff all laid out

00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:49,680
they'll say on the documentation

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,770
prescribers don't do this you could do

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,240
it and it handles the fonts and printer

00:07:52,770 --> 00:08:11,699
will take it and not laugh at you which

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:14,610
is also very cool calibre sure that

00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:17,310
that's actually if you want to do single

00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:21,180
page layout escape is perfectly adequate

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,219
for it but trying to get a nice PDF that

00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:29,509
works well with a printer out of

00:08:23,219 --> 00:08:32,159
inkscape I've been left that before

00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:34,709
there are really no but color management

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,969
in scribus is that's really one of the

00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:38,370
strongest best parts about is how it

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:40,320
handles colors and makes it ready for

00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:44,459
printing I mean the funny thing is that

00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:49,079
most printers are using PDF x3 or one

00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:49,420
and that would be some Acrobat 1.3 which

00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:53,410
is

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:54,610
four versions back right but that's what

00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,839
premise one they want the older version

00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,269
of in Scribus handles it very very well

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,339
so yeah described as its gun caliber

00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:06,639
which you'll hear a lot of people

00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:10,209
pronounce Libre which can you don't have

00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:13,540
to correct them but its caliber who

00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:15,190
knows has used played with it fantastic

00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,389
so for those of you who didn't raise

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:20,050
your hands either because you don't know

00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:22,510
it because you're shy ah caliber is it's

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:25,540
billed as an ebook library management

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,490
system so you have a bunch of e-books

00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,440
and you want to read them and you want

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,029
to read them on whatever device you want

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,149
or on your computer and you don't want

00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:35,829
to mess with DRM and other crazy things

00:09:34,149 --> 00:09:38,560
or even just you want to organize your

00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:39,850
ebooks or you happen to have recipes of

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,050
your own and compile them into your own

00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:43,660
ebook you want to be able to read them

00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:45,610
on whatever device you want caliber is

00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,110
what facilitates that but because it

00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:49,480
facilitates that it's also

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:52,630
coincidentally becoming a fantastic tool

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:54,550
for helping to author epub files mobi

00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,930
files PDFs those are the things if

00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,019
you're going into the e-book space and

00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,149
if you are looking to do giving written

00:09:59,019 --> 00:10:04,990
stuff published so that people purchase

00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:06,610
it or at least ingest it somehow ebook

00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:10,899
tends to be an easier way of doing it

00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,670
and also more profitable for what it's

00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:14,709
worth so calibers sort of a good

00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,750
starting point on that but so is sigil

00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:18,839
which had a weird and shaky sort of

00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:24,120
thing going on last what two years ago

00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:27,760
residual all right so sigil really is a

00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:30,880
fancy well no it's not that fancy it's

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:34,209
it's basically an HTML because the ePub

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,860
format is basically HTML downside

00:10:34,209 --> 00:10:37,870
vestigial is a known supports epub to

00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,100
point out outside of it is that nobody

00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:42,880
really understands how to support any

00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,740
pub three anyway and there were there

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,870
was a stolen development I guess was

00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,279
late last year so where they thought

00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,540
that there was there's not gonna be

00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,040
enough interest to keep developing on it

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,380
fortunately they've recently have

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,519
another also released as soon as with

00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:59,140
April of this year mm-hmm soon recently

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,329
so they're still developing on it and

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,390
therefore it's not as that in the

00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:05,480
functions everyone thought it

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,160
and usually what's going to happen is if

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,650
you if you have any book in epub

00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,420
whatever you submit it somewhere and you

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,120
get some sort of archaic response that

00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:16,310
says this doesn't match spec it doesn't

00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,070
validate doesn't do whatever you can

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,540
edit in caliber sigil gives you a little

00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:27,560
bit easier way of doing so mm my opinion

00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:29,420
celtx who knows celtx yeah so celtx you

00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,630
can use for a narrative format and

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:34,760
long-form prose stuff but it's really

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,100
built for screenwriting that's really

00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:41,930
what it's there for when it's very good

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:45,250
at and anybody familiar with with a more

00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:49,310
proprietary program called Scribner aha

00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,390
celtx is in Scripture but but it has a

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,130
lot of the same sort of story

00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:55,940
development tools that you bet the

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,110
people who use Scribner like I'm not a

00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,090
huge fan of the way that they want to

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,380
pick up the script to a PDF but I can

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:02,240
get into that a little bit later when I

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,220
have a well if I have time for a little

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,270
[ __ ] session that's what we'll get to

00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:10,700
that my celtx is a fantastic tool for

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:13,340
for doing that kind of work illus in

00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:16,220
vain as Celtx there's 12 e who knows

00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:18,830
Trel be it's much less well known it's

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,900
because it's a lot thinner and source

00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,740
and sort of what its feature set is it

00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:26,660
is purely screen screenplay writing

00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:28,220
stuff so if you're writing TV scripts or

00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,010
film scripts or those sort of things

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:36,020
trell be is a really nice thing way of

00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:38,990
doing it oftentimes I'll write in Celtx

00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:42,500
or all I'll admit to writing screenplays

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,730
into them and using this up there's a

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,940
syntax for screenplay writing called

00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:49,310
fountain yes no fountain no okay

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:51,580
fountains is a syntax kind of markdown

00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:55,310
but specific to screenplay writing and

00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:57,440
12v reads it celtx reads it so trouble

00:12:55,310 --> 00:13:01,580
kicks out of PDF it's kind of a nice so

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:03,770
you can pull in a file from the other

00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,570
things and a PDF which is what you want

00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,190
to send out to somebody to review from

00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:10,220
trial trophy of course you could also

00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:12,649
write int R lv that's I hear people do

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:15,079
that so

00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:15,980
that's the whole I put screen running in

00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:17,959
there because i didn't really know where

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,550
else to put writing things so so that's

00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,879
that's the whole track when it comes to

00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:24,470
writing stuffs and again i'm thinking in

00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,139
terms of going from beginning to end

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:31,689
right so if you have a concept for a

00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:33,829
film or a video game or a book right

00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:35,720
these are the tools that you can use to

00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:38,240
pull it from from that beginning you can

00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:41,199
do the concept in kreta or you can do it

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:46,999
in my paint yes ever play with my paint

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:49,249
all right my pain is is a is it's

00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:51,199
rushing it's the it's really good brush

00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:53,029
engine predates cretus and it loads

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,920
faster computer so i'll use my point for

00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,959
concepts and sketches before i'll load

00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,779
creative just because it it literally

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,029
loads a fraction of a second faster so

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:03,980
i'm impatient my ideas don't want to

00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:05,689
wait so I use my pain for those sort of

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,069
things if I if I want to get more

00:14:05,689 --> 00:14:10,459
involved want to have a heavier drawing

00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:11,899
format I want to paint on higher bit

00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:13,490
depth or those sort of things did not be

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:14,899
i'll pull out sort of the big guns of

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,399
credo but if I just want to get a dumb

00:14:14,899 --> 00:14:23,269
idea out on screen then my paints kind

00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,620
of the way that I go with but that's all

00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:27,220
i have for an illustration because all

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:30,379
that the war horses are also create a

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,929
xscape etc are really more than adequate

00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:36,019
and probably the best with a job for

00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:39,889
illustration jobs i'm talking very fast

00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:43,220
time we had here oh yeah i'm going

00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:48,709
stupid fast excellent so video and post

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:52,339
this has always been the gigantic gaping

00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:53,870
sore spot when it comes to free software

00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:57,160
and any sort of creative production and

00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:59,240
that's because video is freaking hard

00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,740
both from an interface standpoint

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,839
because everybody has an expectation

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,319
from whatever tools they're used to

00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,790
using that's one big component of it and

00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:11,949
of course everybody who's used those

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:15,019
tools there rephrase some people like

00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:16,579
the existing tools on the proprietary

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:18,709
side some but most people that i talked

00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:20,569
to have and this goes with any software

00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,769
most people i talked to this whatever

00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:24,410
software they use it's their favorite

00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:25,449
they still hate it right there's there's

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:27,100
still something about

00:15:25,449 --> 00:15:29,739
it that's not perfect that doesn't fit

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:36,179
them that yeah that's usually the sound

00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:38,829
is the angry Frankenstein yeah so

00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,989
nobody's happy and everybody thinks that

00:15:38,829 --> 00:15:43,600
they can do better and so when it comes

00:15:40,989 --> 00:15:45,339
to free software we have its kind of

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,410
sandbox kind of a playground so people

00:15:45,339 --> 00:15:50,439
try out these experiments and it's taken

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:52,029
a long time for any kind of traction to

00:15:50,439 --> 00:15:54,699
happen not just from the technical side

00:15:52,029 --> 00:15:56,709
standpoint but just from getting users

00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:59,470
to buy into whatever methodologies used

00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:01,109
in the editing so first one on deck for

00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,230
that one's going to be kdenlive as

00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:10,869
anybody's everybody yes hopefully yeah

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:13,389
kdenlive is probably to go to too long

00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:14,739
as far as anything goes at the moment if

00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,100
you want to do anything that has any

00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:23,980
level of complexity bez unless you

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:26,199
happen to be weird oh well I i I've I've

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,850
done a lot of editing in blender and I I

00:16:26,199 --> 00:16:29,919
don't necessarily recommend it for

00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,049
anybody else unless you've spent an

00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:36,429
enormously painful amount of time in

00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:38,139
blender painful I look Thunder but for

00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,999
doing video editing is not really the

00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,549
best tool for the job that's really good

00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,559
at it in any case kdenlive is what I'm

00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:47,739
talking about kdenlive has a workflow

00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:50,109
that tastes very final cut very premier

00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:53,139
kind of a feel for it you can drag and

00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:54,939
drop your edits it's a very very editor

00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,939
friendly way of working I've had

00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:59,739
problems before with with sort of

00:16:57,939 --> 00:17:01,629
importing and exporting any format that

00:16:59,739 --> 00:17:05,230
I want but that's gotten a lot better

00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:06,909
over the years open shots actually the

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,480
open shot and the next one shot cut

00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:14,139
these two are also editors they're also

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:18,880
they also don't suck and then they both

00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:22,059
have the purposes at this point there

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,339
they're really really good for cuts only

00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:26,260
edits nothing stupid that's stupid

00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:28,120
nothing super extravagant if you only

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,250
want to cut together video I'm not going

00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,070
to put them as low as say an iMovie

00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:36,760
style or windows media producer whatever

00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:39,840
the name that is hmm when does moving

00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:44,350
it's an obvious name you know thing ever

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,450
use a lot of Windows in any case if

00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,370
you're doing a cuts only sort of thing

00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,590
or minimal sort of transitions which to

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:51,970
be honest and fair if you're doing

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,950
things that are cinematic you're

00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:55,030
typically going to be a cuts only thing

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,700
and a lot of the stuff happens in the

00:17:55,030 --> 00:18:00,340
camera anyway so open shot own shot cut

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,560
are really good tools for that and if

00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,850
you want just color and and actually

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,830
play with the video that you have

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,720
they're actually not bad tools for it i

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:13,480
think i'll be sean has a little bit more

00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:16,210
of a head start then shot but does not

00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:19,270
forget Natron Natron is fantastic

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:20,680
anybody know or see or think of oh good

00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:23,350
i'm not even sure if i'm pronouncing it

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:27,100
right as you can tell from the URL it

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:28,570
was developing a fence it is a

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:31,840
compositing to anybody familiar with

00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:35,170
compositing compositing is so much fun

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,630
alright so after effects nuke these

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:40,980
things sound familiar alright so the

00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:44,650
idea is what you could do with [ __ ] or

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:48,820
Photoshop on a still image after fix and

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:51,580
nuke and Natron can and blender can do

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:53,080
on moving images so you want to animate

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,660
it masked you have a character running

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,580
across from here to there and you have

00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,110
other video footage of fire that you

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:00,640
want to apply to that person because

00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,270
setting people on fire and video is

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,500
always fun then Nate Ron's the kind of

00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:10,960
tool you want to use for that sort of

00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:12,100
thing and that's sort of a higher level

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,160
thing of you if you just want to do

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,610
color correction if you want to again

00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,630
compositing in general the term

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:23,710
composite I'm sure compose you put

00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:27,400
things together like a so-so Natron

00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:29,950
means you're taking video or image data

00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,410
and mixing it together to create some

00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,390
kind of effect and Natron is a

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,640
node-based set up based and again I

00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:38,590
don't have a lot of images and sorry me

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,240
talking but it's a node-based editor

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,590
which is very cool because you can do a

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,440
lot of procedural effects and wire them

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:48,730
together sort of let me give an example

00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:51,730
here um and [ __ ] in Krita in Photoshop

00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:52,809
you have a a layer based way of working

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:54,249
right one thing

00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:56,559
to another and the next layer works on

00:19:54,249 --> 00:19:58,179
the nether and you have this nice sort

00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,169
of stack that you that you work with for

00:19:58,179 --> 00:20:03,759
your effects in general not horrible but

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:06,190
for more advanced image processing where

00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,240
you want one thing to drive another that

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,549
drives another where you want to use the

00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,499
same video input three different times

00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:13,379
to drive two different things and ask

00:20:11,499 --> 00:20:16,570
them together and put them back together

00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:19,690
nodes are way more powerful for that so

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:21,129
I could take example my my imaginary

00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:24,129
person running back and forth here I

00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:26,139
could do an animated mask take that

00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:27,999
video of the guy running by make an

00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:30,129
animated mask from that video source I

00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:32,529
can also use that same video source to

00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:36,159
do color adjustment and then I could use

00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:38,350
the fire video to mix over top of that

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,179
and then make the fire orange well no

00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,559
fires orange make the fire green that's

00:20:40,179 --> 00:20:45,940
a much cooler that doesn't make any

00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:50,019
sense matrons a kind of tool that allows

00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:51,700
you the ability to do that so that's the

00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:54,009
video and post right now there's a bunch

00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,529
of tools that I'm explicitly not

00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:58,960
mentioning Marcia Lee because they're

00:20:56,529 --> 00:21:02,740
not used as much anymore or because

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,450
they're the idea that I'm them trying to

00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,100
get across here is that if you're doing

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:07,840
this stuff yourself these are tools that

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,509
you can explore and play with or if you

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:13,299
know people who kind of you know the

00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:15,940
whole notion of subscription for my

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:20,499
creative tools not kind of cool with

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:22,450
that just hate look at these nice so

00:21:20,499 --> 00:21:27,539
that's why I'm not didn't necessarily

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:27,539
mention straight up ffmpeg Ram player or

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:35,409
similarity be fair I use that find a lot

00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:38,559
over down and I open it up and get

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:44,470
nostalgic and then weep and then close

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:46,990
it audio so I'm the audio heads we have

00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:48,940
here because this is a giant blind spot

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,519
free there's none sweet I can say

00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:54,070
whatever I want yeah none of you people

00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:57,700
online you don't act like you don't know

00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:59,710
anything so our door has anybody seen

00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,169
our door or playing with it okay our

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,650
door is a daww as a digital audio

00:22:02,169 --> 00:22:05,870
workstation

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,610
and it is fan fantastic phenomenal now

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:11,780
getting it installed and setup and

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:13,310
working properly yes well our door in

00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,610
and of itself isn't so bad in fact that

00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:18,380
it relies on Jack um which there's

00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:21,590
anybody ever do you guys know what Jack

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,730
is Oh Jack is fantastic all right I'm

00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:26,150
gonna take a little too quick digression

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:29,360
here jack is an acronym that I can't

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,190
remember what it stands for but but if

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,000
the acronym defines what it is so you

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:37,310
have audio jacks you connecting yes it's

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,580
recursive of course it is it's the jack

00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:44,180
audio connection kit thank you should

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:45,800
remember that in any case so it's not

00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:47,570
yeah the audio connection kit so what it

00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,360
does is it allows you to connect spirit

00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,460
audio applications and let them speak to

00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,960
one another and use audio streams with

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:56,600
one another and they don't have to

00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,940
necessarily be audio just audio programs

00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,190
XJ do is a video player that's Jack

00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,910
where blender if your compiler right is

00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:07,010
Jack aware so you can edit your audio

00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:09,860
for a video film or video that you're

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:11,510
doing edit in our door and scrub and

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:13,100
scrubbing is a little bit harder because

00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,290
the way Jack works but you can do

00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:17,630
playback at least and see your audio

00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,850
edit it's from our door with the video

00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,620
playing live you don't have to export

00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:23,540
from our door load indicate and live or

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,980
blender and then see it and that's wrong

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,840
and then go you don't have to do that

00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,150
Jack allows you to do it in one spot and

00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:31,490
then when you're done get out me into

00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,410
your analyzation process from there so

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:37,130
that's the stuff that Jack gives you and

00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:39,860
it's just the concept of it's totally

00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,810
sweet but it's very very useful downside

00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,710
is a real pain to try and set up and

00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:48,130
install and especially before sort of

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:52,100
low latency and print of credits were

00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:53,180
happening a lot it was a lot harder to

00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,710
do that because you have to mess with

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,360
kernels this stuff like that and if

00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:03,680
you're just on the creative side don't

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:05,300
but I did so our door full audio

00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:08,510
workstation allows you to do these kinds

00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:10,910
of edits with multi tracks and think are

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:13,400
two or three which recently came out dr.

00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:15,140
three or four gives you a little bit of

00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,659
MIDI sequencing as well and you can't

00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,999
necessarily hook up

00:24:16,659 --> 00:24:20,710
set of controller services I don't think

00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:23,619
you can hook up an instrument to it at

00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:28,649
this point but I'm very good stuff in

00:24:23,619 --> 00:24:33,129
the same vein of that Q tractor which is

00:24:28,649 --> 00:24:34,450
also Jack aware but doesn't quite do as

00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:36,429
much as our door but it's in the same

00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:38,710
classes emits MIDI it's for sequencing

00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:40,090
it's for arrangement and it's really

00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:43,210
quite I've never worked with it though

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:45,690
so i can't speak too much other than the

00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:48,999
fact that i know it's a robust tool a

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:52,059
rose garden rose garden is a fun one if

00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:55,809
you if you write music rose gardens a

00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:58,809
great tool because music composing and

00:24:55,809 --> 00:25:00,970
if you understand the strange voodoo

00:24:58,809 --> 00:25:02,470
that is soundfonts then you can actually

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,929
have some new playback that makes sense

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:07,659
I don't understand the stranger to that

00:25:04,929 --> 00:25:12,129
it sound fonts I told you I didn't

00:25:07,659 --> 00:25:15,729
notice talking about your people talking

00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:18,309
to you guys too anyway in the same vein

00:25:15,729 --> 00:25:19,929
there's also musescore which also does a

00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,129
lot of the same things that rose garden

00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:22,629
does and I'm going to plead a little

00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:25,090
ignorance here and then I'm not sure

00:25:22,629 --> 00:25:28,539
what what sort of advantages of one

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,809
versus the other is anybody know more

00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:33,549
about it than idea that can tell me if

00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:40,570
somebody does make comments in youtube

00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:43,330
we love reading those baby just hydrogen

00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:46,419
this is a fun one hydrogen is a drum kit

00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,099
and also Jack where by the way I should

00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,929
mention that a reasonably sure Rose

00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:53,080
Garden is but hydrogen is also Jack

00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:55,690
aware so you could be and as a drum kit

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,460
but it works with any sample so it plays

00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,399
a lot like fruity loops if you're

00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:02,889
familiar with a proprietary world you

00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:04,299
can sequence a bunch of samples and have

00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:07,239
them plan of eaten or just the timing

00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:10,570
and those sort of things and it's

00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:12,429
actually just a lot of fun to sit down

00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:15,220
and just put stuff in order and see if

00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:17,619
it works it's kind of a fun just to kill

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:23,769
Tom and sort of put audio spaghetti on

00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:24,429
the wall hydrogen is great for that it's

00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:25,119
also really

00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:26,649
if you want to put something together

00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,909
and then give it to somebody who knows

00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,350
something about music and hopefully

00:26:27,909 --> 00:26:30,549
don't laugh at you and say to make

00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:35,409
something that's like this but you know

00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:39,429
good hydrogen is good for that 3d

00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:42,999
printing not a lot that I have on this

00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:44,289
one but there was one personally ah and

00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:46,330
you could tell me if I have any blind

00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:48,519
spots on here which their enormous ones

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,429
so obviously blender works great for 3d

00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,019
printing for generating that content but

00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:54,820
oftentimes blender doesn't talk to

00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:57,129
printers not to d premieres that 3d

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:59,200
printers not printing personnel at a

00:26:57,129 --> 00:27:00,700
shop there's they're they're under

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,019
doesn't do that you export your file

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,249
when you do what you need to not

00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:07,299
sometimes you pull that into meshlab and

00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:10,360
meshlab let you do a lot of analytics

00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:12,730
clean up the file if you happen to have

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:16,539
gotten a file from somebody maybe a 3d

00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:19,779
scan or somebody who exported from

00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:23,590
blender or some other 3d program they

00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:25,990
exist apparently and that file isn't

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:28,090
really you know water Titan and all the

00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,440
fun requirements necessary for 3d frame

00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:31,450
excellent can help you clean that up or

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,809
at least help you identify the problem

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:38,350
areas for that in the same vein is that

00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:40,779
measure slab also i don't believe speaks

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:43,059
directly to printers is that it doesn't

00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:44,320
want none think it is here but it's good

00:27:43,059 --> 00:27:45,940
for cleanup and it's good for those are

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,909
things for speaking directly to printers

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:52,749
i know that there's replicator g which

00:27:48,909 --> 00:27:56,619
has probably the cutest URL that of the

00:27:52,749 --> 00:27:59,220
set here um because they use the org as

00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:08,110
part of the name i thought that was Oh

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:09,519
in me giggle but now it's because it's

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,230
replicated where they spell it it says

00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:13,090
replicator with an uppercase G so I'm

00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:17,320
going to assume unless that's supposed

00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:18,759
to be replicated or her um which they

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,590
should totally you guys anybody from

00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:26,649
outfitter you should totally rename it

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:27,730
to God please but you when you want to

00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:31,740
get something into a 3d printer a

00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:33,639
through the process of slicing it and

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,440
sanitizing the data that you thought you

00:28:33,639 --> 00:28:36,659
already sanitized so the 3d printer

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,299
understands it

00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:44,249
2g code which is what the gene or

00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:48,989
energies for uh uh uh sometimes I know

00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:50,940
what I'm talking about so and the cool

00:28:48,989 --> 00:28:52,349
thing about not only is that open source

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,149
but does work with a number of different

00:28:52,349 --> 00:28:57,239
printers so your MakerBot soryu tillman

00:28:54,149 --> 00:29:00,479
filmmakers in the same rep wraps all

00:28:57,239 --> 00:29:04,019
this variety of printers most of them

00:29:00,479 --> 00:29:07,220
repair is either can't already work with

00:29:04,019 --> 00:29:10,649
it or can be shoe home to work with them

00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:13,679
and there's more about there's no no

00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:16,529
hola oh wait a minute wait a minute I

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:20,729
talked really quickly with it for 30 hmm

00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:23,239
now there's nothing so this I'm gonna

00:29:20,729 --> 00:29:27,269
stand by that there's not enough time

00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:31,440
but just like any catch your name and

00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:32,669
player guy Jonathan fantastic just like

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,159
just like you pointed out there's

00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:36,869
there's in player and ffmpeg and a whole

00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:39,029
bevy of tools because these are just

00:29:36,869 --> 00:29:40,859
these are on the creation process but

00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:42,679
there's a whole set of tools if you're

00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:45,029
doing any sort of large-scale production

00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,599
just having the tools to make the pretty

00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:49,859
stuff it's not enough and there's there

00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:52,499
is a bit of a blind spot when it comes

00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,669
to infrastructure that's that's it to

00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,619
organize especially if you're doing a

00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:58,559
large project that requires only level

00:29:55,619 --> 00:30:00,690
of collaboration version control there's

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,299
try to explain version control to an

00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:07,499
artist outside of the games industry and

00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:16,679
even then they're like perforce but turn

00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:18,330
in a trend yes nothing is built out of

00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:19,889
the box for that there's you can use

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:23,639
things like sparkle share which is built

00:30:19,889 --> 00:30:24,629
on get media goblin not really built for

00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:26,279
that kind of thing I've seen people try

00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:29,129
to you want it to use it for that kind

00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:31,409
of stuff I started using subversion for

00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:33,629
a long subversion surprisingly handles

00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:37,799
binary blobs not in a completely crappy

00:30:33,629 --> 00:30:39,690
way relative to other things for more

00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:41,700
distributed stuff it's for me a lot of

00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:44,309
times I bounced between mercurial and

00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,539
subversion depending on how many people

00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:48,540
are going to be working on it and what

00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:51,630
other platforms are going to be involved

00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,130
I've toyed with fossil for it the wiki

00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:54,210
built-in thing is nice but I would

00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,340
really like to be able to add more

00:30:54,210 --> 00:31:00,750
things to it so there's there's there's

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,220
stuff and it can be used but there's

00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,160
nothing really built for but that's

00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,750
because making pretty things as kind of

00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,740
a niche area when it comes to open

00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:10,320
source stuff so there's not a lot of

00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:11,580
attention is that and again the artists

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:23,430
don't pass the artist don't know they

00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:25,710
need it so I wish but the thing is for

00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:31,140
those for that sort of data you either

00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:33,290
need one of two things either diff

00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,240
intelligently which on a binary blob

00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:39,030
it's not gonna happen though there's

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,490
some fun fun tools for doing dips of

00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,800
specific types like you can get hold of

00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:46,800
a meaningful diff on an image if it's

00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,450
not compressed right you can say this is

00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,580
this is the pixel that changed on a

00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:53,850
raster image if you have vector graphics

00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:55,170
it's if it's organized the problem with

00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:58,140
would say like in inkscape violent

00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,210
escape is XML right you can save that

00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,950
inversion it but from one safe to

00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:04,260
another when you make as many changes as

00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:07,140
an artist does it's not a meaningful

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,330
diff right so that that becomes sort of

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:14,610
the sticking point so you'd have to be

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:17,400
able to just like version control

00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:19,800
systems for text understand the context

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,690
of i'm doing a murder gino's i

00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:24,330
understand that this lawn relates to

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,500
this line and that was that just let

00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:27,630
you'd have to have that kind of

00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,640
awareness and you have to be able to

00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:31,410
build plug-ins for the fur an existing

00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,870
version control or not to handle those

00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,920
specific kind of files and again artists

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,870
don't know that they need it and

00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:38,250
therefore it's it's not of a huge

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:44,700
interest for any developers to try and

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:46,140
pursue it I guess also wish I would if I

00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,380
had a dollar I would throw it at

00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:52,200
somebody because it should exist it

00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,060
would like these kind of tools are and

00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,910
not just that but stuff it ties into

00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:58,860
project moment stuff I use for a lot of

00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:01,180
my larger projects even smaller projects

00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:04,540
just to organize the time on it I use

00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:08,970
which is it's this kind of heavy-handed

00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:10,960
that but for setting up tasks for

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:13,210
organizing people doing stuff you can

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,930
customize it and you can't charts it

00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:18,490
that your thing but and they did tie in

00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:20,050
with version control so if I'm using a

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:22,210
subversion repository or a mercurial

00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:24,100
repository read minds fantastic because

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,960
I can just point to it and say work on

00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,550
this file the downside is that unless

00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:30,310
you're using a subversion you can't you

00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:33,370
well the program also is when you're

00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:35,800
working with a larger project saying it

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:38,680
a 3d animation you're not going to

00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:42,310
necessarily want that entire film

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:43,570
project to be pulled down right I if I'm

00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,310
giving something to an animator I just

00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:47,350
welcomed an ether scene they don't need

00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,910
the scene I mean they can see dailies

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,200
and finished videos they don't need to

00:33:48,910 --> 00:33:52,540
see the rest of everything they just

00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,280
need animate their scene so with

00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:56,260
subversion you could check out just a

00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,670
subdirectory any distributed system

00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:02,110
they've no way if you plan ahead and

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:04,960
know what's going on but there's like

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,110
there's a lot of planning and we don't

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,640
like the plan at least not not to that

00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:11,230
final level when it comes to the data

00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:16,600
side of things we like that to be a

00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:18,130
little bit more nimble so yeah there's

00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:21,820
there's there's there's a whole series

00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:23,800
of tools that are sort of ancillary and

00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:27,550
related to the creative process stuff

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,620
that aren't there and they work and

00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:31,030
they're good but there's a few gaps that

00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,980
basically were using stuff that wasn't

00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:34,630
designed to be that way but serves a

00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,500
purpose like again version control

00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:39,600
project management those kinds of things

00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:46,990
all right now there's not enough time

00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:48,610
but there's always one these programs of

00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:52,000
course aren't perfect and this is what

00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:56,260
you're gonna get when if you if you tell

00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:59,550
somebody oh you know I I use Blender try

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:02,230
that in a go to siggraph it used to be

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:06,400
not as bad or used to be worse than this

00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,300
now but um no you'll you'll get people

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,530
who are already used to a certain

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,970
workflow again this is what I was

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:11,710
talking about with video people who are

00:35:09,970 --> 00:35:14,710
used to working a very specific kind of

00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:16,359
way they'll find things that they don't

00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,910
like the find things that there are

00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:21,099
ponds but these now these programs are

00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:22,660
perfect and like I said no programs

00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:24,280
perfect everybody kind of hates their

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,869
their tools there's at least one thing

00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:28,000
about every program that everyone uses

00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:30,700
on a day-to-day basis that they kind of

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,080
hate does anybody have any programs that

00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:34,540
is always perfect for them by the way

00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:36,550
I'd like to know this program it's i

00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:47,220
will i will drop whatever I'm doing and

00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:51,640
learn it just just give in to it I'm not

00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:55,170
you got me so no these these programs

00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,170
aren't perfect but that's not the point

00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,280
the there's a there's a conception and I

00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,859
talked about this whenever anybody

00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:08,020
listens which to be fair isn't isn't

00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:10,330
often so thank you ah but there's

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,890
there's this desire this this mindset of

00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:14,770
people who use the tools in the people

00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:17,380
who develop them that say our tool needs

00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:19,450
to be the best in class has to be the

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:24,010
most popular the one that everyone uses

00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:26,400
blah blah blah blah blah blah blah no it

00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,359
has to be able to do the job for

00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,730
whatever the person needs to get done

00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:32,800
and so no you're not necessarily going

00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:35,349
to see blender in Pixar's though they've

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,640
used it by the way you're not going to

00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:42,820
see kdenlive used in public TV station

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:44,230
or maybe public but affiliate affiliate

00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,640
TV stations and those whom you're not

00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:50,010
going to see it use there you're not

00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,900
going to see [ __ ] used all the time

00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:54,130
bye-bye you know a professional printer

00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,849
photographer kind of personal asst

00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:59,260
that's their thing right but they don't

00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:01,300
have to be those those people if you

00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,890
need if you do photography and you need

00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,570
to make an edit it's going to be useful

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:06,339
for you it has a tool set to do with the

00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:08,170
job we need to get it done if you need

00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:09,280
to get 3d animation done and you want to

00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:12,220
collaborate and render it on a

00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,690
bucketload of servers and don't be a

00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:16,270
license for every single one of them I'm

00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,220
just kind of great for that that's kind

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,770
of the point that I'm getting at they

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:23,900
don't have to be perfect because no tool

00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:25,309
is they just you just have to know

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:26,859
how to use them and navigate your way

00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:29,150
around just like any other program and

00:37:26,859 --> 00:37:31,940
that's that's a mindset thing that I'm

00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:36,799
personally very interested in seeing we

00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:38,180
can do to adjust and so it's X that

00:37:36,799 --> 00:37:40,880
that's what I'm getting out you can go

00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:45,109
from concept to finished polished

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,569
polished stuff that looks good using

00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:51,559
only free and open source software it's

00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:56,359
possible people do it all the time more

00:37:51,559 --> 00:38:00,950
importantly it's not that weird for it

00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:05,180
to happen well enough of them I'm not

00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:08,240
that weird for doing it because I'm not

00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:11,420
the only one that's that's another thing

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:14,299
that I really there's no I participated

00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:15,349
in a gigantic sort of i'll say gigantic

00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:17,720
was really three or four of us just

00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:20,119
yelling pretty loudly about the fact

00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:24,230
that there are a lot of creative people

00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:26,180
who are using if not entirely open

00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:28,369
source tools in their pipeline at least

00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,140
a good chunk of it and they're doing

00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:31,460
professionally we're doing this for

00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,380
money people are paying it for a

00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:37,430
creative output and these are the tools

00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:38,900
that we use and it's not that weird it's

00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:43,400
not that strange and it's not as

00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:44,839
uncommon as anybody might want you to

00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:51,079
think a lot of us don't talk about it

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:54,170
because we're busy working and yeah

00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:57,799
that's kind of the main thrust that I'm

00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:59,660
putting it that so um how can I say so

00:38:57,799 --> 00:39:01,880
if you do happen to run across people

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:05,390
that want to know stuff I'm gonna try

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,520
and because I panicked making these

00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:09,079
slides I kind of made them at the last

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,119
minute I didn't I didn't upload them

00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,770
ahead of time like I should've i'm a i'm

00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:20,630
a bad monkey um alright this is reveal

00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:22,039
jeaious so I mean HTML go way back so it

00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:23,839
seemed like it made sense free and I

00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:26,599
wanted to play with it anywhere so this

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,510
is kind of I did small modification to

00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,920
this is the basically the default one of

00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:33,950
the month default themes that comes with

00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,550
it so yes it's a fancy website I'll put

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:37,230
it somewhere and so

00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:39,690
maybe i'll put a link to it from the

00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:43,290
youtube comments will have to read

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:46,500
youtube comments right but this is and

00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,850
then maybe I'll poses into something

00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,640
that makes sense is words it's not just

00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:53,640
me rambling about but this is the good

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,710
list of tools to point people to if you

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:57,120
find somebody I want to do compositing

00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,590
well you can play with blender you can

00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:00,240
play with Natron I want to do video

00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:01,560
editing well I've got three good choices

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:03,690
here you can play with kdenlive if you

00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,310
can play with shotgun or open shot or a

00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:09,510
blender if no you already know 3d stuff

00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:12,480
painting you in a play with credo or my

00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:14,940
pain these kinds of things make those

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,410
recommendations and they're free right

00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,740
so try them out yourself and see whether

00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:20,880
or not you like them no because that's

00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:24,410
that's what they're there for there to

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,260
be used and not just used by people who

00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:32,120
use them to know beat themselves they're

00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:39,480
there for everyone to use so yeah

00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:43,410
questions the type things yes raw files

00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,090
raw photos I would play with is UF raw

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,800
which gets you and put it in in but by

00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,510
that point you're still working Nate bid

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,570
because Jim hasn't gotten higher bit

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:53,610
depth just yet darktable though is a the

00:40:51,570 --> 00:41:19,530
tool for that that I would push you to

00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:24,420
it yes built-in I wish um I've I when I

00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:26,280
used to write oh good call so I first

00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:28,830
the first question was for handling raw

00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,160
files which your fraud and dark table

00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:33,390
the other question is me see if I can

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,040
rephrase it in a way that makes sense to

00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:40,560
me or yeah because I feel answered is if

00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,170
you have writers or putting a lot of

00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,660
stuff on get but writing tools aren't

00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:46,920
version control aware and if there's

00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:49,080
anything out there that does not already

00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,540
and not that i know i mean

00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,920
you could I'm sure you could write

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,120
something for emacs to do it because I

00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,120
mean access an operating system to

00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:59,630
itself right so that I'm sure their show

00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:01,710
suffer like that I would love for

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:03,180
institue of themselves need to have a

00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,490
greater awareness I used to do a lot of

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:07,920
my writing in labor office liberal of us

00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:09,720
has a fantastic feature called this is

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,520
where I keep a little [ __ ] sessions

00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,680
but Libre Office is a fantastic feature

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,230
for a change in two doctors between two

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,300
oddities it'll show you basically a diff

00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,400
between 20 DTS one that makes complete

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:23,190
sense not accessible from the command

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,410
line therefore you can't long therefore

00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:28,770
if you're doing mercurial HD gif from

00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:32,100
occurred hg diff from mercurial or the

00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:34,280
equivalent and get it's not going to be

00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:37,770
able to launch that is your diff tool to

00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:41,070
test it and change it it should be able

00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:43,380
to you so again this but this goes back

00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,390
to I think artists don't know that they

00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,820
need it and therefore the people who

00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:51,330
write the tools don't think to provide

00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,680
it and that's something that would be

00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,060
nice that's why I like whenever I talk

00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,500
to anybody who does any sort of creative

00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,020
productions what are you doing

00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:02,010
versioning and inevitably it's what's

00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,930
versioning beyond I'm riding it in

00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,490
putting a zero in a little one and then

00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,900
saving into the free and then saving

00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:12,180
again with the four and then Sydney

00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:14,160
again with final final 3507 know this

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,740
problem has been solved on the code side

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,610
we can use the creative side so that's

00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:23,100
sort of as a giant I wish and if anybody

00:43:20,610 --> 00:43:26,970
is privy to people developing these

00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:33,620
tools say you wish to because I which

00:43:26,970 --> 00:43:33,620
doesn't mean anything other question yes

00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:51,960
it depends on the sector um for instance

00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,520
the question is in mind this stuff that

00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,780
I do professionally when people adopted

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:59,310
up the source tool is because it's free

00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:01,910
because this open source and free of

00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:09,180
caught yeah sorry sorry beer and speech

00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:11,220
and I'll say yes ish if you're doing if

00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:12,390
you're running a render farm right

00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,190
there's an um and there's a number of

00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,160
them that that give support for instance

00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,950
for blender and a render farm you have a

00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,180
renderer you gotta pay per processor

00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:24,000
sometimes I used to do per core which is

00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:27,780
dumb but well done expensive is great

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,900
business idea but but it they used to

00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:33,240
get to charge for a license per seat for

00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,890
a rendering so there's obviously a cost

00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,860
benefit too well I'm going to just throw

00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:39,720
blender at all of these and for a lot of

00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:41,580
farms when they first offer services

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,690
they'll do all their testing in blender

00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:46,410
because at least it's a low cost to

00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:47,370
entry but oftentimes blender doesn't

00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:48,510
necessarily give them everything that

00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,130
they want and won't be able to slice

00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:51,570
things ingest it so the ability to

00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:53,960
change the source to access the core

00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:56,190
source and make those modifications is

00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:58,620
valuable in those instances and that

00:44:56,190 --> 00:45:00,030
happens and sometimes even bets course

00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,190
gets pushed back upstream which is also

00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,850
sort of general good citizen kind of

00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:08,490
stuff where I work it's the same sort of

00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:10,350
thing we we chose it harshly because

00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:12,900
it's free because it's not a big shop

00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:15,390
I'm the artist there right this is a

00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:17,190
couple of you who do 3d work and the

00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:19,740
animation set of things but it's a small

00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,870
group small team sure the company could

00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:24,090
afford the license but the cost was was

00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:26,190
was an entry point on that but the fact

00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:28,260
that we can adjust it modify it tweak it

00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,990
and really get into making sort of

00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,540
changes that we want for our specific

00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,370
use well you can't get that anywhere

00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:37,350
else especially with a small team you

00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:40,230
don't have I can't call up autodesk and

00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:42,930
say hey I want you big a couple changes

00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:44,310
and just send them just to me or at

00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,420
least give me the code give me the

00:45:44,310 --> 00:45:47,610
source and I can get somebody to make

00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:48,750
those changes for you no problem I'll

00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:51,570
you'll have to do any work just give me

00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:53,400
the source I don't think that phone has

00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:54,260
ever been to picked up from for me at

00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,280
least so

00:45:54,260 --> 00:46:02,480
that's yeah it's the pragmatic since

00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:04,370
cost is is obviously first and foremost

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:08,120
and a lot of people's thoughts but I

00:46:04,370 --> 00:46:10,100
think that's sort of the gateway drug

00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:12,530
for it for us because once you realize

00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:17,150
that you can do changes to it opens up

00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:23,500
whole wide techno stuff you can do other

00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:23,500
thoughts ideas questions stuff yeah

00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:43,519
right

00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:52,760
right the comment is that the the a lot

00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:55,339
of freedom put source tools have the the

00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:57,290
UNIX philosophy of of one tool for one

00:46:55,339 --> 00:47:01,430
job whereas a lot of commercial my

00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:07,400
proprietary tools tend to sort of allow

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:14,180
feature creep as a feature and yes ish

00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:17,060
to a point I mean landing 11 12 for one

00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:20,030
job is fairly true when it came out as

00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:23,240
well um but I don't nothing's perfect

00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:25,369
but the and i think that's that's true

00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,230
to a point but i think it's it's not so

00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:32,420
much that it's an interoperability thing

00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:34,220
right what audio does with Jack can in

00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:35,480
some cases I think should be a model for

00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,010
what you can do for interoperability

00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:41,450
with all of these applications well the

00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,109
sourcing capability is there and

00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:46,580
obviously you can't just plug in place

00:47:44,109 --> 00:47:49,070
blocks of code and expect things to work

00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:52,640
but that level of interoperability

00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:55,609
that's why I say the adobe suite plays

00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,020
as nice as it does with itself is mostly

00:47:55,609 --> 00:48:03,859
kind of if you're keeping your eyes

00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:05,810
closed I'm a little biased so yeah I

00:48:03,859 --> 00:48:07,640
mean but I think interoperability

00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,200
between tools and getting these

00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,839
communities to these sort of dis

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,060
desperate disparate communities to talk

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:17,270
to one another and say I'm doing this

00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:18,920
this relates to you and final formats is

00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:22,790
the first place where it starts that's

00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:26,089
where like openexr and I just completely

00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:28,820
open master format for for raster

00:48:26,089 --> 00:48:30,800
graphics these kind of things are sort

00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:32,240
of the first salvos in that way and I

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,960
think I don't think you're ever going to

00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,670
see sort of imagination of you I but

00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:42,250
just being able to talk one another is

00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:42,250
going to be a great sorbonne thing yeah

00:48:55,330 --> 00:49:01,330
yeah a lot of a lot of them just use a

00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:01,330
fin pic yeah

00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:22,120
right well the the the the the

00:49:19,630 --> 00:49:23,290
questioner point was that since a lot of

00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,480
them a video side of things everything

00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:28,690
is using ffmpeg on the back end maybe

00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:30,390
that's a an avenue for getting the

00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:34,030
version control between system setup

00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:36,790
which I would say in general yes but

00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:39,490
when it comes to video specifically most

00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:41,650
edits are non-destructive so you're not

00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:44,170
until you do your final output you're

00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:47,140
not actually manipulating the video

00:49:44,170 --> 00:49:51,460
itself you have a file that describes

00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:53,290
the mutilations to the video so does

00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:55,180
very good for version control if they

00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:57,460
could be sanitized a consistent from one

00:49:55,180 --> 00:50:00,520
save to another and some some programs

00:49:57,460 --> 00:50:04,710
are better than others but for that kind

00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:08,140
of thing sweet yet be great but I think

00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:10,330
if you were doing changes to the actual

00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,530
video that what ffmpeg would be a great

00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:15,460
way of doing it I don't think a lot of

00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:17,530
places are not since um uh what was a

00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:21,780
crappy program but I used to edit in I

00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:29,530
can remember it but yeah but there's

00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:31,750
correct right and a big challenge and

00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:34,120
the big challenge and a lot of what's

00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:38,290
taking video so long to progress to the

00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:39,760
point it has on free software is not the

00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,010
for file for at to describe those

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:44,350
changes it's playing them back in real

00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,670
time without rendering that's the

00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:47,460
challenge that's always been and very

00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:50,260
difficult there's a lot of that sort of

00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:58,440
patent territory and stuff and it gets

00:50:50,260 --> 00:51:00,940
to be kind of hairy so there there are

00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:05,470
there the other there are edit formats

00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:07,300
there there are and you can use them to

00:51:05,470 --> 00:51:10,030
get at it's one program to another

00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,470
immigrant proprietary programs because

00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:13,270
oftentimes will kick out the next ml

00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,820
format or something that tastes a lot

00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:19,450
like XML and so you can get the edits

00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:21,820
that way and their standards on those

00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:24,700
but they're more for interchange of an

00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:26,130
editor by themselves or a company that's

00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:29,299
doing at it throw their going on

00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:29,299
buying a loan program

00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:44,839
well see what's the what's the

00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:46,420
non-proprietary video format hey I mean

00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:50,960
I mean there's their day I mean OGG

00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:53,420
Theora depression on its kind of sorry

00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,309
the web am Julia web Emma's is there the

00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:58,539
downside neither of those is that the

00:51:55,309 --> 00:52:01,640
your compression ratios kind of ass

00:51:58,539 --> 00:52:02,750
which those are deliverable formats

00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:07,430
anyway that's not something you want to

00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:09,500
edit in so I mean UD wrap you could wrap

00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:18,680
the sequence of pings in an AVI and call

00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:26,240
it a villa it is called Ravi I and it's

00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:27,559
it's yeah yeah well there's there's knew

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,119
there was mean they were trying to do

00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:30,680
with it yeah that didn't play out as

00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:32,390
well either and then there again you can

00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:35,029
in rap a sequence of paintings in an avi

00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:40,779
file if you really felt like it blender

00:52:35,029 --> 00:52:40,779
does that if you want it to so yes

00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,750
but

00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:40,450
right so I'm gonna tell me that repeat

00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:43,510
that in a short way um the the idea is

00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:45,190
that if you're using between say

00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,869
Photoshop and [ __ ] if you know again if

00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:48,660
you know Photoshop it's going to be

00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:50,890
painful until you figure it out so it's

00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:51,700
getting over you know how do you

00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:53,980
convince somebody who's already

00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:56,920
ingrained in that set up and then

00:53:53,980 --> 00:54:01,090
related slightly to that is the fact

00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,740
that celtx is moving towards the

00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:03,760
software-as-a-service kind of thing

00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,109
backing away from the desktop

00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:07,990
application those kind of things which

00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:14,560
absolutely is an issue to address the

00:54:07,990 --> 00:54:17,080
first one I don't other than make him do

00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:20,170
stuff it does better you know and have

00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:22,480
people do good stuff like the number one

00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:24,430
best marketing tool for any / on any of

00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,980
these programs is making awesome stuff

00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:28,270
and showing it off and and you know to

00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:34,180
elicit agree showing how you get it

00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:36,520
that's that's I wrote an article these

00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,900
proprietary programs they have marketing

00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,640
departments they have QA departments

00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,310
they have these sort of things open

00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:44,560
source yeah a little QA but no marketing

00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:46,960
that's as people who use the tools

00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:50,890
that's that's our job that's that's what

00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:52,619
and we suck at it right where we're part

00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:55,450
of the documentation team we're part of

00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:57,700
the marketing team that's what we're

00:54:55,450 --> 00:55:00,100
we're you know that's not responsibility

00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:01,300
and I have a lot of very strong opinions

00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:05,260
on that I'm not gonna go ranting about

00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:07,720
but that's how that's I mean in ghent

00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:09,310
gets tools ahead of Photoshop um the

00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,990
liquid rescale thing that hasn't

00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:12,640
photoshopped a couple years back hip had

00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:15,850
that for a year and a half well before

00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:18,700
Photoshop everything that's what it is

00:55:15,850 --> 00:55:20,590
as far as Celtic son as far as Celtic

00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,820
sekot's celtx is on this is one of my

00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:23,109
gripes I've had with him for a long time

00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:25,480
because they've always been kind of a

00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:26,920
software-as-a-service situation if you

00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,530
write in Celtx and you want to get your

00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,820
screenplay out as a PDF file it would go

00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:32,109
through their servers to come back to

00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,030
you so you really couldn't get a PDF

00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:35,980
without being connected to the internet

00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,750
when you use Celtx and i was never a

00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:39,130
huge gigantic fan of that the rest of

00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:41,770
the writing tools are spectacular the

00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:42,640
fantastic but I was never a big fan of

00:55:41,770 --> 00:55:43,630
em that's

00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,830
that's always been part of their

00:55:43,630 --> 00:55:46,810
business model because it's I mean it's

00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:50,100
a free product is open source product

00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:53,830
but that's part of their business and

00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:55,510
that's why ultimately Astrid screenplay

00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:58,360
sort of stuff I've been writing found on

00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:02,370
them and then using tools to kick out an

00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:33,250
effort that fountain file to a PDF file

00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:34,990
yes the comment is basically give head

00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:37,270
what [ __ ] called liquid rescale and

00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:39,820
Photoshop calls content content aware

00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:42,970
scaling I think the IMP at it for a long

00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:46,980
time first and able to do stuff well in

00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:46,980
advance because you can that's awesome

00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:54,670
right well in that those are those the

00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:58,120
the marketing thing has brought up that

00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:59,680
that blender of the programs has had

00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:01,810
kind of a marketing wing that's because

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,000
if and kreta to their credit also goes

00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,780
like with all the crowdfunding campaigns

00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,080
that they've been doing in the last

00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:09,220
couple of years blender sort of blenders

00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,690
always been in that thing right blender

00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,860
got free who doesn't know if you guys

00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:12,880
that's blender got free because

00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:14,950
community bought of that for the

00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,300
original company went bankrupt right we

00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:19,240
bought it Rihanna and we're kind of

00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:21,250
passionate about it and the open the

00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:23,620
open projects are great marketing for it

00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:25,000
but they're also there are the best

00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,320
avenue for putting artists and

00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,310
developers in the same room and having

00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,560
them yell at each other and get

00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:31,780
something done that's nice and that's

00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:34,360
that's something that's really useful so

00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:37,720
oh so that's that's that's really useful

00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:39,670
that so that's a benefit that a lot of

00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,130
open over the source of free software

00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:44,440
programs don't have that luxury and so

00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:45,610
that's the sort of environment where the

00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,500
developer says you know you could really

00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:49,150
use version control and that's why these

00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,620
won't remove the parts has been using in

00:57:49,150 --> 00:57:52,600
this case subversion for a lot of their

00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:55,240
stuff is that will look and then the

00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,230
artist figure out how to use subversion

00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,680
and they go forward with it

00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:03,750
um I'm just short on time here so I've

00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:07,090
got my own little personal this is me

00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:10,630
you look me up follow me that sort of

00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:12,220
stuff um I do I I do have some things to

00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,470
give away and I had no idea how I was

00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:17,080
going to figure out how to do it um I'm

00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:18,460
still not entirely sure but but I'm

00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:20,280
gonna try and do it so you guys are on

00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:25,030
video listen I you should have been here

00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:28,210
um that's the creepiest laughs I think

00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:30,130
I've ever done alright so i told you

00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,780
that i've i've ever written a couple

00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:33,280
books i've got one minute left join us

00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:37,090
it's very quickly I've written a couple

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:40,090
books so I'm a prolific liar this is a

00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:43,540
book that was written in markdown

00:58:40,090 --> 00:58:47,140
converted to both an ebook and print

00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,130
with scribus and the cover was done in

00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:49,390
blender actually wrote a whole article

00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:52,170
on how I did the cover and that would

00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:54,790
not I've got two of those and I've gots

00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:57,190
to blender for dummies books anybody's

00:58:54,790 --> 00:59:01,470
interested in those what you're going to

00:58:57,190 --> 00:59:04,630
have to do in order to procure them sea

00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:06,310
monster java guns calm my twitter handle

00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:09,430
and social medias monster java guns and

00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:12,550
IRC a sweep over the course of today and

00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:16,780
tomorrow come find me and tell me what

00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:19,840
those come from if you can tell me what

00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:22,780
monster java guns is how that relates to

00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:25,420
me then i'll give you your choice of

00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:28,810
whatever i have left tweed too but

00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:30,280
that's a little more strange so there

00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:32,490
you go track me down i'll see you guys

00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:32,490
out

00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,360
you

01:00:03,470 --> 01:00:05,530
you

01:00:11,060 --> 01:00:15,290
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:18,260
you need to integrate manage and

01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:20,420
automate a virtual data center all on an

01:00:18,260 --> 01:00:22,790
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:25,490
platform and at a third of the cost of

01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:27,110
other solutions but why even bother with

01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:29,270
virtualizing your server infrastructure

01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:31,220
in the first place well let's say you

01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:33,530
have a traditional one server to one

01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:35,540
application architecture but you're

01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:38,090
running out of resources and performance

01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:40,390
is suffering once you order new server

01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:43,280
hardware you'll wait for delivery

01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:46,160
configure it install your business

01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,920
application stage and test the server

01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,140
and finally add it to your production

01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:53,330
farm if you've been through this process

01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:55,820
before you know it can take weeks or

01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:57,680
even months you also know it's a

01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:59,660
manually intensive process that will

01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,960
burden your team every time you outgrow

01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:04,760
your current setup with a virtual server

01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:07,520
solution you could accomplish all of

01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:10,100
that in less than half a day server

01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,930
virtualization software separates the OS

01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:14,360
and application from the underlying

01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:16,520
server hardware and with multiple

01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:18,230
virtual machines on a single server you

01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:21,200
can use each of them to run different

01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:22,970
os's and applications this makes it

01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,800
possible to move your virtual machines

01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,810
from one piece of hardware to another

01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:29,090
whenever you want to maximize

01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:31,040
utilization simplify maintenance or

01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:33,440
recover from a hardware failure and

01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,680
without slowing down your applications

01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:39,350
or users clearly server virtualization

01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:42,380
provides big benefits and Citrix

01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:44,600
XenServer provides even more since it's

01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:46,460
built on an open platform xenserver

01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,740
plays well with your existing hardware

01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:51,050
storage systems and IT management

01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:53,780
software as well as with the industry's

01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:55,850

the first time expanding your server

01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:24,290
virtualization footprint or moving

01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:24,950
server workloads to the cloud download

01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:27,170

01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:51,089
your customers rely on your website or

01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:53,279
application if it's slow and

01:03:51,089 --> 01:03:56,220
unresponsive it infuriates your users

01:03:53,279 --> 01:03:58,019
and costs you money keeping your

01:03:56,220 --> 01:04:01,570
business critical systems humming along

01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:03,850
requires insight into what they're doing

01:04:01,570 --> 01:04:05,800
your system metrics tells stories

01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:07,810
stories that can reveal performance

01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:10,120
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:11,710
other problems but how do you keep an

01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:14,410
eye on all of your systems performance

01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:17,440
metrics in real-time and record this

01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:19,210
data for later analysis enter longview

01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:21,160
the new way to see what's really going

01:04:19,210 --> 01:04:23,320
on under the hood the long view

01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:25,390
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,910
of all your systems providing you with a

01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:31,300
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:33,880
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:35,620
load and network usage click a specific

01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:38,050
system to access its individual

01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:40,560
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:42,910
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:44,560
comprehensive network data including

01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:46,870
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,430
available on the network tab and disk

01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:50,350
rights and free space on the disk

01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:53,170
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:55,720
displays usage statistics for individual

01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:57,880
processes the system info tab shows

01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,130
listening services active connections

01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:02,260
and available updates adding long view

01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:03,970
to a system is easy just click the

01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:06,100
button copy the one line installation

01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:08,560
command then run the command on your

01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:10,240
linux system to complete the process the

01:05:08,560 --> 01:05:12,430
agent will begin collecting data and

01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:15,940
sending it to longview then the graph

01:05:12,430 --> 01:05:18,190
start rolling use long view to gain

01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:22,950
visibility into your servers so when

01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:22,950
your website or app heats up it stays up

01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,280
