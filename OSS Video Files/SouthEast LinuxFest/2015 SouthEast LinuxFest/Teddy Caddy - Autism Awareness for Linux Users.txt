little feeling secure the awareness is

00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,469
early but hey why not have my proposed

colleague or anyone to give me one it's

00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:30,909
good to know more about my personal

00:01:29,109 --> 00:01:33,369
profession developers from college and

00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,960
I've seen in that are also focusing on

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:37,479
high functioning autism when I swear I

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,280
comfortable Congress or even with dad so

00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,880
I don't kind of cuddle and talk about

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,579
things i'm pretty no no no inner city in

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,439
between my experience my experience and

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:49,600
I'm just here to do them myself I don't

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,979
represent any organization there is

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,759
anything really wouldn't committed of

00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:56,529
any kind and also adding prevalence

00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,029
estimate is different that simile if you

00:01:56,529 --> 00:02:00,279
met one difference when I was in the old

00:01:58,029 --> 00:02:02,049
is the one person autism conscious so it

00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:04,810
was just on because though you know what

00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:07,380
I have to say no my not really doing a

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,380
person everybody

00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:13,120
so I am a hot little period it's really

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,420
good pretty interesting because the

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,470
place is kind of what led me download

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,800
professional action was really first

00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:23,860
place babe I like computers like kids I

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,350
had a bit of an old boy in our boy well

00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:28,030
programming a Maryland badly just didn't

00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:31,230
think computer that great manager my

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:34,540
saying all I know about was my garment

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:37,270
this was when I crashed in their earned

00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,500
out of time disease I just used

00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:40,330
computers basically to do deep in

00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:44,080
homework and research we don't and then

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,630
I was in mba school it doesn t do to us

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,550
this is process is called it now LG he

00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:49,930
made it mentioned opens or the

00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,990
technology like how that looks

00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,790
interesting exactly now and I fell in

00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:57,190
love with labels inevitable because then

00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,320
i was amazed anybody's how you can just

00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:03,670
go take an old piece of work piece of

00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:05,709
acrylics on an MP and i just had that

00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,140
kind of kind of a prom rolling and

00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:12,010
started learning whatever i could about

00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:14,290
Chris up Jove into it and one thing sort

00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:16,920
of led to another driver jalan linux

00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,510
server there's a native and more

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,780
difficult as hell they were filled with

00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:26,260
a windows files over feels like that far

00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:29,410
away and a lot of a lot of officers who

00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:34,150
other kinds of service and did some web

00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:35,790
development to let trivet i'm here in my

00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,370
development and I was as web developers

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:42,010
you for about 45 Warrior groups which

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,769
delivers working with here what I did

00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,720
today be very enterprise research are

00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,730
three certain place we like we wanted

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,709
really complication of computer software

00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,480
that phones almost every accidentally

00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,459
knocks potato cultivars a station for

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:57,160
business so i would like to market

00:03:54,459 --> 00:03:59,950
higher head hi go ahead it runs on my

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:04,390
friends on but still use linux loot job

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:06,070
job now and oh and oh i was diagnosed

00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,600
with diagnosed with high functioning

00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:10,989
autism to know two processes through

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:12,580
parameters an adult is a little you know

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:16,120
really came as a surprise at the time i

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:18,400
always do but i was different today I'm

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,620
doing very well always had trouble for

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,910
me to troubleshoot but I sort of sorted

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,830
kind of stopped paying

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,810
and really notice that we let us obtain

00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,000
what happened it is currently in a house

00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,730
fire house fire countless all my

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,990
relations phantoms and I want to say

00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,000
that people always do queenie because

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,460
they not but they sort of place their

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,010
biology on edible objects and tina

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,900
familiarity lose everything you gonna

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,330
make you read vocalist and just

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:47,700
everything about using danger aspect of

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:50,700
life or just really really threw me off

00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:52,410
model that was about everybody out of

00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,740
her house everyone all about group our

00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,240
final interesting maybe there's big into

00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:59,820
this and so I read this is over this

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,430
book and and I prescribing movies

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:05,280
growing me to achieve two thousand about

00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,320
maybe not a person that person the one

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,760
who's enix I'm not and I remember really

00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,230
look remove reading about how the

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,700
automator I gotta wait where this is

00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,850
where you so much and it's just the way

00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:16,470
I is maximized my tried to get

00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,450
reading everything in their loading in

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:21,479
looking like it was not why I'm so do I

00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:23,520
also the pants of it wash is washed and

00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,060
I liked it because thing we open

dishwasher is nothing left piaggio run

00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,320
it and on and on that was just one

00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,590
noticeable describing me it just really

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:38,840
to learn about his lap of stuff and and

00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:41,070
so the next word in the salad is a

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,590
professional jumper so not actually

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,060
turned out actually turned out okay we

00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:47,100
got my son down there so dumb cat

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,500
meantime any minute rates and interest

00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,570
rates in tomorrow yeah after I finally

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,050
after a Harley you sound image so don't

00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:56,850
you know if it is cuz the stupid a

00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,400
bigger businesses not knowing not

00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,560
knowing you slide by the lay of our 10

00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,410
devices maybe you think you little more

00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,050
normal anymore but really it was pretty

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,289
tough not feeling up and even inside

00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:14,220
Mary's I think I found got a reason why

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:17,310
it is good or 60 I know what became sure

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,070
I'm here or or you know I just go down I

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,300
guess what doesn't work work non-stop

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:28,590
your legs done a bunch of chitchat or

00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:30,539
the way I was only doing it do so well

00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:31,979
in the world early into the verbal or

00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:32,900
the reason why my handwriting is

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:37,130
incredible

00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:39,350
it why I hate in my heart hurt us apart

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,650
reason why I was drunk and I was no died

00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,960
English or reason why I don't like I

00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:47,270
need / much socializing so a lot of

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,370
experimenting for other way further and

00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,280
you know the reasons I've had trouble

00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:58,490
communicating and the reason why or

00:06:52,280 --> 00:07:02,060
where I am right now so it's totally

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:05,300
minute of every recruited patchy kid a

00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,400
few kids owners vodka soda diagnosed

00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,800
rogers rogers and reprocessing this your

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:14,030
granddaughter a dollar who's thinking

00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,479
disorders that's what about the diss

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:20,389
some to do so no no no shortly after

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:22,280
immersing up in disorders and autism is

00:07:20,389 --> 00:07:23,630
a preface the pervasive devil you know

00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,150
it was the word was over the world is

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,150
open season skills and to include Leslie

00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,580
criminal language skills and we just

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,880
really minimal because when I'm talking

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:36,229
about Japan limited we'll talk about it

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,940
just talk about social and communication

00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,220
social the only case particularly

00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:43,669
particularly an autism it's a big topic

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,860
obviously is a big topic in become a

00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:48,199
freaking hour so Emily singer said we've

00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:50,720
done I catching out this I McDonald is

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:55,310
it with the hockey hockey community and

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,810
creamy and as I guess I found a decision

00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:00,289
of whether I'm playing with never let me

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:03,530
listen to me we used to just a bottle to

00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,550
build executive algae oh it's just going

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:06,260
to kind of come out in their kind of

00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,880
come in it contrasts one versus the

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,380
other gathered and then let me take that

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,389
from each other about senior so very

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:15,860
soon either it's kind of tough to find a

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:18,070
good effort i'm at your differential on

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,180
this one but is basically probably

00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:24,010
ingenuity surgeon directly to survive

00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,000
anyways yeah you got never over

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,070
stimulation or unders make an ice cream

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,479
like maybe you're still nurse will

00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,159
notice going on around to you or we run

00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:35,180
on to remove you tune it out to the

00:08:31,159 --> 00:08:36,860
marrow save your life and I'm like all

00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,690
right I apologize when I thought Justin

00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,690
well be honest with you the idea tears

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,909
it

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,380
can I did it a little bit but the

00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:46,380
symptoms like eight years I've waited

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,630
years to identify myself as equals it's

00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:52,350
no more place in the workplace so you

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,570
know trouble with Arsenal is a big big

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:57,540
one is a big nice tune that out to that

00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:59,490
or maybe it might prefer for you know

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,980
it's the notice of land in the door or

00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:04,650
lock or naturalized natural life

00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:08,940
difficulty to neon Cody Camille be the

00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:10,590
person who can defend or just can't get

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,810
my troubles just my opinion all the

00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:14,640
noise alone in words love is war to have

00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,780
any conversation from one person you

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,270
might have heard some problem shooting

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,220
out scientifically where the definitive

00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,570
it's too thinks it they might have

00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,180
troubles you have trouble students

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,190
because music so Donna sins so I like

00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,230
tattoos but while you're working with

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,150
like repeatedly not just like

00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,910
occasionally but pretty thoroughly or

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:38,430
rocking back and forth my entire sitting

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:39,870
in a little bit okay and the SPD's been

00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:42,450
as good you've been with large amount of

00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:45,780
neuro a little project i am kim it's

00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,670
just dumb it's just so it's a hard time

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,410
of hard time doing input and if you have

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,780
one says the applause to the mall that

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:55,110
throws every turn office every single so

00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:56,610
the fact of it I mean it can't be out

00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,400
all the noise well with no more smoking

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,510
or defamatory and you know one thing

00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,980
I've always thought of thing I've always

00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:03,990
thought about where access to disorder

00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:06,390
righteousness or dentists or there is

00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,010
just look at me versus you felt the way

00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,350
that you feel a little million connector

00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,030
notion about it oh so let that century

00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:15,420
fine with that history privacy because

00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:17,190
you know enough 10 but basically it's

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,930
been energies among those on over your

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,130
sensory unit resistance is trying to

00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,589
push you in from the front of flight

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,830
mode like loading in all situations

00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:28,920
where good relations with a banana can

00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,810
create an hour ago i buy anything about

00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,810
it having up you know between two is

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:36,870
eccentrically getting with people feel

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:39,000
like an open in the sensory input the

00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:41,850
user input the year and so just a couple

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,620
of examples from my life my life go out

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,250
go out sunlight in the marginal day

00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,140
a meteorite water just as you know I

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,330
have trouble mada total part and i just

00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:55,240
gets to that too much input and i can't

00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:58,210
which is out or you know things might be

00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,810
a single around example continue my file

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:05,380
or malaria yet really active have a mind

00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,180
for some intense and um though you like

00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:10,240
the sense of the liquid Soviet yes I

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:13,210
always feel I always get in my pjs in my

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,260
pinky Chad was like nine is this

00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:19,270
something is really hard to move hard

00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:22,510
and this is really the supply of the

00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:24,610
fire this one is littered with my story

00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:26,410
let's order go ahead will not go ad not

00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:28,300
just crackling the civic for sure we've

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,060
all heard about her thought isn't right

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:33,190
to going on below maybe you've heard

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:35,890
things like really my sis or something

00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:37,530
to that but I really just think that it

00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:40,960
just leads to better diagnose later

00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:43,060
diagnosing it and so for example the

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,010
Ravens alderman ardently or art them

00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:47,410
with the population as a whole because

00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:49,900
and adults grow up in the firm your time

00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,750
is my magnet for that I know and I

00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,390
really think that it's part of humanity

00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:57,010
humanities probably know probably

00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:58,660
obvious got any more combating the

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:01,630
likenesses America these people are

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:03,190
dying man ever but well you know this

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,750
part of a genius i betray us to the

00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:09,130
community who who may not either not a

00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:11,110
man diagnosed maybe they haven't

00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:15,040
discussed it but it could be you

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:17,050
somebody keep your promise and you know

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,570
there's a book of arguments always work

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,820
hard for humanity if you like son LOL

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,590
over up to the ran into the grave and I

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,120
usually tell you to submit per minute

00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:27,340
the wheel so cool it was supposed to

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,990
impress me and fire was a good talker I

00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,520
don't really know family goes I

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,380
definitely think that I just it's always

00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,050
been a party with her so much and people

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,390
who got a fall in this category getting

00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,550
different and and you know what I just

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:41,290
you're letting this kind of hard time

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,120
about a hard time which is a little time

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,340
with my wife give me a look game it was

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,600
a famous to hear me on Serbia and that

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,390
includes people like her includes your

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:52,000
boy Amadeus Mozart is me right heart

00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,010
right Nicola Tesla attention with its

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,630
lots of great miles of rumors that he

00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:57,630
was pretty villages in 20

00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:03,230
and then this just kind of gets you know

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:05,870
back to work talk about my opera day

00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:08,470
with you guys is there you know linux

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,810
does have a noticeable with autism and

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,250
it's a little space here it's sort of

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:14,870
between the top two will come to the

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,970
rest of them but once on the bottom are

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,040
really more than I keep container there

00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,680
isn't necessarily about my daughter

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,980
information property so you know

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,230
rationalism people da jism have dolphins

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:29,600
long-desired on his very own existence

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,910
complex systems have called the hydro

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,850
system Isis's you're both very funny and

00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:36,920
and honestly it really it was like an

00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:39,410
idealistic boys won't take it interested

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:44,089
if you take things literally it's really

00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:46,279
much more more relaxing or better as a

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,940
little worth of computers bridges human

00:13:46,279 --> 00:13:51,800
beings are over it ignore elliptical

00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:53,930
don't you know the totanac the same as

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,600
you say they melted in a bit of my fans

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,279
in it computers / dude perfect control

00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,500
of all trouble but really to bring the

00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:01,940
food relates community news and more

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,040
about black and white thinking likely

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:05,570
buddy Vince affair necessary so but

00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,329
overall i can write thinking like big

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:11,660
finger you know it's either to actually

00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:14,480
write those shades is great one of the

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,990
other and other is imagine it anywhere

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:20,240
ability most people don't think like my

00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,339
the ACP is a and it's a little bit of

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,620
this little bit too close what well

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:26,510
inspector in moments better usually one

00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,029
of the uppity up and I kind of felt like

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,459
I felt like from the GPL and just the

00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:34,040
whole idea of employers there's a lot of

00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:35,750
pocket my complex where you know T

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,110
they're open to it until it opens and

00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:42,699
you're releasing it in screeching a city

00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:45,410
or it is not and we kind of from

00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:47,240
everyone he open source Mason and

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,579
there's a food is also compared to

00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,820
writing on writing music creates the

00:14:49,579 --> 00:14:56,329
street mantra about open source but I

00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:58,279
would it you know it's the right wing

00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,810
debating image of you talks were making

00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:01,670
all the available there's our sense of

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,890
morality there and holla you later it's

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:08,300
pretty place and I'll into people with

00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:10,190
autism there's some biz oh it's just

00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:13,070
like a foundational really

00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:15,110
just not fair but should be that chunky

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:23,900
pendant by the way we see the really

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:26,720
loud all right let's just not even talk

00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:28,670
that late pop rocky unique skill stuff

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,800
no so great that i mentioned that i love

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:32,750
business another office because thank

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,900
you read the left for people but it says

00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,910
different different so people with

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,520
autism with all bring an entrance with

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:42,470
his say I'm really more beautiful and

00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,920
data in the Z romantic a lot easier how

00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:48,200
much right in the zone there now to know

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:52,250
other things because basically work

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,590
Angelo tell us you know I believe and we

00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,330
might work best when i can noticed like

00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,700
a definitely for those contra watch my

00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,490
it might be because we're so focused on

00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,650
focus over we have a weight of our

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:07,100
kitchen to drew 2 ml detail about some

00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:09,050
so it's just maybe we're more likely

00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,420
more likely with one little horny limit

00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:14,150
of office for someone else someone else

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,640
and just we're always going to be always

00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,500
going to be profound details mayo we

00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,970
must exploring the world we have a

00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,380
understanding what i'm serious let's

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:26,510
comes like I said about that I've said

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:29,150
about that a hundred well the theory

00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:31,130
that you know you people dodges my

00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:33,290
cousin like Helena creative in places

00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,930
complex and we think rationally parish

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:37,220
believe computer to work for Ashley and

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,570
we have a different person ever to be

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,220
perfect the different perspective

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,760
respectively important it can really

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,980
help little skills can I help prevent

00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:47,570
approve of ink and just you know just

00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,370
you know everyone else might come else

00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:51,950
when its own or whatever the boss

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,960
awesome we might not even be not even

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,420
better that you go along for the Boston

00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,089
and just interject idea idea great idea

00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:00,710
be rid of you never though you'll see

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:03,350
lots of people hiring initiative

00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,000
initiative now I cannot achieve in

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,470
parking structures once I say that

00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,630
really say that you know not only are we

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,000
don't know every critical testing

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,100
testing the cook we provide more gradual

00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,860
innovation we just have extraordinary

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,890
ability ability for memorizing and

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:20,839
rising income accessory in a while

00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:22,589
someone when someone is a mattress or

00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,270
termites or characters

00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,480
they might not have a my bell peppers

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:30,090
are great fiction we're co-workers so I

00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,700
just wanted swarm of this too because it

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:35,520
might this up my you've seen in anywhere

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,700
this might be might be the person who

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,110
comes across come back often and all new

00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:41,520
business or in them they might not do

00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:44,640
well when I have to go with off as

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,309
possible example Jameson is a the

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,679
professor professor asked that much he

00:17:47,309 --> 00:17:51,090
autism this was again a university in

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,700
newburgh they doing all the research

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,010
they can or community as I can to get a

00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,840
ten-year finding there but they're not

00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,700
really addressing the wheels then it

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,649
will medicated with the decision makers

00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,630
and if you're making sure that include

00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:05,730
they like them personally because that's

00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:10,980
really good food really get cheap tenure

00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,779
to they might not be good my small talk

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:15,600
before I wouldn't worry I'm definitely

00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:17,100
guilty of is that means to come in the

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,770
workers work until it's time to collect

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,419
on deck exactly easier to me or for me

00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:23,340
to work is it in small stomach that

00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,110
small hockey is where ha eaters work is

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,730
like people I comes naturally but

00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,370
obviously that's not opposite way and

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,809
it's the most people must be good

00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,730
justjust sustain a small talk all day

00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,580
long okay they're going out in the work

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,549
and the work they enjoy Smalley good way

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,049
to the pastor time I and I unison oh yes

00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,460
might not think of my loud me and

00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:43,620
probably early Mike nicely and they

00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:46,770
might break some other others among

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,220
social work you know other examples are

00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:52,200
vividly first we forget your name or

00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:55,320
someone who emerged email to me really I

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,880
think guilty is my cell if I remember I

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,380
remember someone new to completely

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,570
 over the preparation technologies

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,309
where I work and I can learn a lot about

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,409
their work thing we had lots of kids

00:19:02,309 --> 00:19:07,169
good once they'd always start on me like

00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,850
now correct me if I'm wrong in and of

00:19:07,169 --> 00:19:12,480
course it'll take things literally I'm

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:14,429
literally in it doesn't really want to

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,120
be pregnant every time he's technically

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:19,470
wrong in a note or you know if I'm gonna

00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:21,929
be real friendly something at everyone

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:26,909
else yeah oddly you know what I mean it

00:19:21,929 --> 00:19:27,779
looks at the fusion food everyone else

00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:32,460
is everybody welcome to beautiful

00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:34,500
thinking and maybe the person who comes

00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:35,130
across in the know it all or most little

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,430
arrogant

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,160
and they just don't tell them hoes they

00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:42,810
don't really necessarily want to come to

00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,030
austin swear it's just coming for they

00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:47,160
are doing today are they don't really

00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:49,050
realize they're breaking off the

00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,970
original noisy it'll come naturally to

00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:53,010
know if you don't know they was it and

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,780
this house he might be thought about to

00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:59,340
be feeling the same way to a bomb wale

00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:00,690
Paco work for versus you know like my

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,400
boss didn't want to hear every doctor

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:04,260
along in the meeting technically you

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,540
know that night kind of that kind of big

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:11,490
difference so just somebody way so you

00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:13,100
kind of making out a junkie come again

00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,240
that last word is out that principle

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:17,460
just try to anticipate through the

00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,080
manipulation signages it might come

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,150
across come across don't want to be a

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,970
part of rotation that might not be the

00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:25,950
case and you know don't be a bit i want

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,190
more than her or may not be the most

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,870
fluent Ellen conversation but faces of

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,520
her name to learn more you know it might

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,540
go to one mic off thanks for drinks

00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:38,010
afterward and yes even if the givers

00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:40,470
they don't want to go to go he goes I'm

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,110
coming up I'm sure that people

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,390
appreciate being invited in this goes

00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,340
the same 30 to say even shy you know

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,260
nothing if you don't work is it a little

00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,230
better to help of work and just forgive

00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:54,030
the social faux pas impossible maybe

00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,210
they were trying to be assistant reviews

00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:58,470
upon secured maybe even realize it and

00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,970
you don't need a hold a grudge it's

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:01,740
about something that happened you have

00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:05,370
been to offend you to image if you can

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,720
let it go it is clear and just for

00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:09,420
simply answering all the time but maybe

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,130
I just make something an engine and it's

00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,960
not really big dog leading and under

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,390
just a different perspective like it

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,760
doesn't offend you finish box and you

00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:21,990
know just a happy to have patience and

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,280
just um just so just upside is for

00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,540
someone on the spectacle me and

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,550
obviously things you can do to try to

00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:28,530
read you talk about and no one thing I'm

00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,630
not know it always helps to be

00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,700
technically in all that we can you know

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:35,100
we might know we might know how no

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,380
indication the small talk really do

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,490
pretty much figure out the girl system

00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,630
is really well we might have never

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,090
wanted Mike mother the note

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,250
working for you know something they

00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,050
would feel you feel comfortable when

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,090
they come up for advice or anything I

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,410
realize I'm coming across the Soviet

00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:52,440
provide people don't really want to edit

00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:54,450
the woman they have to to assoc if I if

00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,580
I came across as arrogant know-it-all

00:21:54,450 --> 00:22:01,530
they if they're coming to me with a

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:03,810
crush expose you know consider it you

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:07,350
know that was the big step in the makeup

00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:10,320
in helping for my cell doubt it and kind

00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:14,130
of create appears up someone who really

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,660
sees how much that builds I build

00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:17,310
friendships and relationships in the

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,080
office and kind of helps the technical

00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,500
when you need selfie he know that eat

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,960
helps emmaus out and about might make it

00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:27,780
social faux pas troll ball because you

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,700
really are a nice person with them some

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,350
more automate on the you might say the

00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,430
word play reportedly deal with

00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,700
communication obviously you

00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:37,830
communication isn't an issue with autism

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,890
and I'm particularly you know what I'm

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,720
talking about then capillary where

00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:45,270
they're blue or grammar and spelling

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,220
we're all talking about complex language

00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,590
like at the edge of language would

00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,990
comprehension and influence and

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:53,850
nonverbal can inaudible and nonverbal

00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:56,010
communication in this the 93rd

00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:58,020
percentile a communication they save it

00:22:56,010 --> 00:23:00,810
up seriously I person facial expressions

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:03,630
mitchell 38 who sent or deep well kind

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:06,180
of your voice boys toys and things like

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:08,040
that indigo don't leave seven percent

00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,010
little to work with in which he

00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:12,720
literally merely is what people are just

00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,850
yet it's nice to look at the word so

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,800
they must you have a 93 feel good and it

00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:19,290
kind of works the other way over to the

00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,780
code it might not be aware of anomaly

00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:23,460
about their giving off might say one

00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:25,980
thing city want to look a different way

00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,280
and we're probably over probably nodded

00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,080
and all about what they said and them

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,670
you know another committee about 112

00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,560
issue with this is the person who did

00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,960
really well in his tent they got

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,520
promoted for me a minute they're not

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,930
working for technical system at me more

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,890
they're working with a little and

00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,720
following probably Asian in

00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,340
tellingly someone who did really well

00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,720
moved at all with the open air isn't

00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,010
performing as well in his new position

00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,780
and that's the common common common

00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:56,860
scenario there's you come try to educate

00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:59,200
yourself autism and some solution Lupin

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,980
we can provide here is I talk literally

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,630
was anything to metaphors or be around

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,180
the boys run before come out and say

00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:10,180
let's get with autism devour covering up

00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:12,190
the lines so it can be helpful you know

00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:15,130
will spell out your expectations been

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,660
pin make it clear you back them just by

00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:19,420
putting it so not good not good not

00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:20,920
especially when it's up to a nonverbal

00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,900
kind of bringing something or something

00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:24,640
with not that nickel written

00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,190
communication is really write an email

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,930
envelope messaging because you might

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,450
have you in no wise it helped it would

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:33,490
help you kind of think out usually no

00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:36,660
clue behind the message but reread

00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:41,590
attributed think that whatever

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:43,720
communication you had you have reread it

00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,090
and avoid this to the police mr. engaged

00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,140
and this last one wanted to help by

00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:49,870
private i'll tell you hard especially

00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:52,600
those from so so this is just kind of

00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:55,690
something becoming a mentor present a

00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,160
boss or supervisor but just sort of be

00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,750
like you know I know you will I tell you

00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,880
this when you did this look really

00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:02,830
really came across as either coming up

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,020
so you killed it this day in the best

00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:06,820
possible always going stop regular tix

00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:10,300
are on it's how you make people feel

00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,890
they would each of you and it's true is

00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:15,100
that's what people remember is how they

too much information about into another

00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:04,500
culture is one more serious resident

00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:05,730

and up and learn about their self

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:34,799
diagnosis prosthetic process which is

00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,330

I'm comfortable I sort of course list of

00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,950
the do it was interview supposed to do

00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,510
it good in my own element look at like

00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:53,159
I'd look at the pattern in card out of

00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:54,750
his locker or something like that I some

00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:58,320
kind of AI want to look at my linking of

00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,570
all making do you uh find any upset when

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,150
you look in there are people with autism

00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,789
really cool difference me and it's not

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:10,100
just about a big big stuff it's about

00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:13,380
little stuff so maybe if you need you to

00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:15,270
breakfast the way morning movies that

00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,980
throw a couple who have a ripple

00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:18,780
ripple progress of the day dividend

00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,210
something is off from home in the

00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,880
morning just ruin everything else 2 more

00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:25,679
you for that day but the repetitive

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,240
motion comes voice song is talking

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,280
pretend you're telling you what happened

00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,220
footy particularly like a dream about

00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,049
your entrée less anxiety when Simon come

00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,600
out more from what that really is every

00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:39,270
is aiming to mingle weichert 20 to

00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,830
provide people with sensory Protestants

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,299
or the props i do this because each

00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,980
others injured input that's

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,390
uncomfortable and a paid like a bit

00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,850
having a foot like that if I'm gonna

00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,340
walk it out or something else you know

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:53,340
to feel since realized 31 of this dump

00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:56,370
don't occur connected or do you have

00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:00,059
sensory up to expectation violation I

00:27:56,370 --> 00:28:01,890
some less obvious basically being from

00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:04,590
myself a look when doesn't go the way

00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:06,240
you migrate to be everything very small

00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:08,490
and really what this is about

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,260
so you really more upset more about that

00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,820
should be and if you look at rash move

00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,130
your credit be this episode of this

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:18,420
tight little thing that I am because I

00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:20,370
didn't basically anyone in sensory

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:23,130
issues their big topic obviously go

00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:24,600
ahead please no just there's all kinds

00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:26,520
of such motions you could have it could

00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,650
be tagging your clothes I get those

00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:30,600
bright light bright lights at night for

00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,520
supplies the poor handwriting they're

00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:35,610
joined with with fine motor square

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,110
meters or own room you know I never knew

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:39,179
that under move not about the factors

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,160
yeah I don't like something that much

00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:43,650
for that I'm educated and I do a little

00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,179
bit more now that my own tongue soft

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,559
playground that concern you guys back

00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,350
they don't need me to give up me but

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,420
lets you play swing for very long rizal

00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,190
you know I don't get dizzy I don't mean

00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:55,920
right how long I swinging that's another

00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:57,450
sort of sign that made him the huge

00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,010
sensory the very nervous histories

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,050
inspiring the way they run everything

00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:02,429
weighted when I was reciprocal and i

00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:06,540
would recommend reading your commitment

00:29:02,429 --> 00:29:08,870
John with child this isn't on the camera

00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,090
look looks like and I know it does say

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:15,559
the topic for adult for the boat not

00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:15,559
going to find under the climb and

00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:21,150
basically the others duty on Sega told

00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:22,770
that they don't deal with the stuff of

00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:26,040
childhood and it's a really interesting

00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:27,690
book it's a little it's a little sad to

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,920
be sir Justin sometimes I say why you

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:30,600
want to make sure you increase your

00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:33,030
child if you don't forget a time in life

00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:34,800
oh that's me I gotta pretend about geez

00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,780
I didn't get this when I was a kid but

00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,360
otherwise it won't really on visibility

00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:43,080
I opening it means good jobs explainable

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,850
on sensory issues like a dichotomy maybe

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:47,070
your sensory seeker or more sensory

00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:50,070
order and done it's going to clean two

00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:52,950
of those and then fruit of my business

00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:55,740
really is improvement of sensory you

00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:58,230
have like a broom bring many things you

00:29:55,740 --> 00:30:00,990
think will you avoid to avoid stress

00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,780
recently on cellular throat and for me

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:08,880
and I don't mind the technology things I

00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:11,090
don't want to know her for over and just

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,610
get on to see resources here estar this

00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,110
isn't fitting in five minutes our way

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:19,399
before seen anything to do it there is a

00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,279
huge computer plug so I find that is

00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:24,679
but in there are there are lots of

00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:26,929
little dinky little need to have a

00:30:24,679 --> 00:30:29,659
winner but I'm sort of learning change

00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:31,159
my things stay the same way but I have

00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:32,450
to learn you have no batteries overdoing

00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:34,249
it self improvement for self-discovery

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,499
those of you have a hard time doing a

00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:38,719
great job prostitute but you know was

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,160
from Mystic Connecticut old hood your

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,270
brain and you nervous system they big

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,060
enough Anthony and what's the other

00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:13,440
things that you do that it's going to

00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:17,370
help you out and help you out and then

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,680
the thing called a sensory diet and this

00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:20,760
is kind of where I kind of worried

00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:23,180
they'd even looking at these think you

00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:25,050
even want to play we work the play with

00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:26,460
presentation presentation but they're

00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:29,280
kind of hello and come in follow-ups

00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,470
into the diet so we have so we have some

00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,490
essential oil such a royal hooking smell

00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:35,250
these you're taking down the

00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:40,620
presentation that's fine but part and it

00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:42,240
is the things for vision revision like

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:44,220
this look like this was long asleep on

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,380
the car everything from it is usually

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,790
good just relaxing to look at this is

00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,280
something you can have on your desk over

00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:53,430
and you can just you know if you need to

00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:55,590
be quick you know check it out nothing

00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:58,110
about that is really visually realize we

00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,700
got a lot of humble lot of time to seize

00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:04,470
you getting season as individuals you

00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:07,760
know it end up son he'll put colored

00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:10,350
lenses are rated right about right about

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,330
you know it's more very cool but maybe

00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,370
you can't get on the whiteboard

00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:17,340
whiteboard whatever reason what a

00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:18,570
yellowtail is discipline so just check

00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:24,080
it out and see if I get out if you

00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:24,080
looking we have the mac up with intercom

00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,620
like this because it's fun the fidgets

00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,050
with these are common to do toys you can

00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,390
do so did you do that you definitely

00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:34,620
just ever play with the wall here or in

00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:37,890
a concentrated think Russell getting

00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:39,980
over myself whatever this little and

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:41,340
then I have most persons but it's

00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,440
brilliant

00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:48,270
instances that the internet working work

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,470
with me immerse in some instances so the

00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:52,110
2 i'm talking about you i'm talking

00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:55,560
about here in lower into the vestibule

00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:58,110
are said to be more sensitive about a

00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,090
year in a year in pisa can people in a

00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:04,470
door with a drill bit or a rocket or

00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:06,360
hitting upside didn't like hanging

00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:08,250
upside down while you so no more intent

00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,900
to distribute i've invested yet if you

00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:12,510
really want to just give me go further

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,490
approval for the most intense when you

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,920
got out there and i'll cut yourself

00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:22,920
isn't that is a feeling impression of

00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:25,290
joint and on occurring around our help

00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,670
out or rock me rock do something that I

00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,950
data are going since you're done

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:31,260
employed on the trampoline ok were

00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:33,300
mapped handle belt out and then this

00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,950
things that kind of combine both okay so

00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:38,220
I mean we're going riding like we're

00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:40,800
riding but brother try to buy them I'm

00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,660
around the trim away some of that that

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:54,180
piece is swimming in the summertime I'm

00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:56,100
written if I was nice so finally gonna

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:59,220
going to interpret eat here like I said

00:35:56,100 --> 00:36:02,550
an argument about you LOL today really

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,890
really really confident it's just rather

00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,570
just private some of the advice universe

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,090
you can separate out emails for kids so

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,070
you kind of have to absorb make a little

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:15,150
more grown up with logo doesn't apply

00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:17,550
when I have a couple ODI and I in pic

00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:19,230
figurative recruits you can't see my

00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:21,360
triple grande and appropriate that's

00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,620
some thug I like these books a life and

00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,050
cookie dough by people from a generation

00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:28,080
or two around if they didn't curl

00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:30,960
sources for August neither and up they

00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:33,750
found out late no no a pretty good she

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,430
good accomplishment on elder rivers

00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,440
little cookies the document document

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:39,750
guitar catch on fire pit so-called

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,910
enemies and him he's had an interesting

00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:44,040
life force an interesting Bayern for you

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:45,720
know and how he um he runs a really

00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:48,410
success of really success auto repair'

00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:51,810
auto book release for visits for like

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:54,589
rolls-royce and other really fancy gear

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:57,380
comparison and

00:36:54,589 --> 00:37:00,440
tipple Grandin Road she's um she works

00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:01,819
she develops a livestock system of her

00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,380
prefer like the cattle in the order to

00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:05,509
be like that but she has a real trick

00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:08,719
isn't it true take on life David and I'm

00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:10,279
not so bad teeth as you like a kind of

00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,009
said better serve you some things

00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:15,950
improve your quality of life by avoiding

00:37:13,009 --> 00:37:17,599
things it just dwell on the negative but

00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,279
your old less credible suspect it's

00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,200
really called pretty cold the general

00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:23,900
best practice is a meta more of Mary

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:26,299
more transparent and Ramirez will use a

00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,339
computer command or that won't end up so

00:37:26,299 --> 00:37:30,440
that we can slide this is a book that I

00:37:28,339 --> 00:37:32,690
read as I've i really be inscribed the

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:36,259
dishwasher and this is kind of a thing

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:38,690
that really opened up my eyes then I got

00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:39,979
all I got me in it it's just really

00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,599
interesting system leaders you're like

00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:43,999
my husband Eric Andre and father

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:46,400
primarily more talkative than ordinary

00:37:43,999 --> 00:37:47,749
but i also had on their open campus it

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,700
is books about communicate the

00:37:47,749 --> 00:37:52,460
communication is do something to sub to

00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:54,559
prevent some coming gonna grab the press

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,989
your life probably and uh right now I'm

00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:59,749
reading over you tell me some it was a

00:37:56,989 --> 00:38:01,249
pretty simple day or the lube anything's

00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:03,289
gonna be in the woman is probably the

00:38:01,249 --> 00:38:05,059
coding they would read that agenda but

00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:07,609
I've been a year to get her to get all

00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:10,279
the type of a kind of look it's just the

00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:13,579
casting the coveted field communication

00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:16,279
I just want to end with it which is

00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:17,690
pretty pretty pretty whatever they're

00:38:16,279 --> 00:38:19,160
really good religion but for quality so

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:21,380
I've always liked and I kind of feel

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:23,660
like you ever feel like I besides having

00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:27,259
August in August because you cannot

00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:28,579
change it or change and and dumb but

00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:31,339
these little things is anything as you

00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:33,049
change you to change understand it in

00:38:31,339 --> 00:38:35,210
addition there's the middle does it

00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:36,920
contain literature interpreter and such

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,839
one is going to know that and we

00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:43,759
appreciate you sharing a blimp make

00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:45,319
educated you respect a little bit

00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:47,210
fittings Mabel it's very safe in the

00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:49,160
more Slade but every question is

00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,349
everybody can come and talk to me if

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,009
you're talking action so thank you

00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:54,009
everyone thank you

00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:39,099
nice good trick because it's nice

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:51,460
octubre back 20 dishwasher things

00:39:39,099 --> 00:39:53,140
especially your customer site or

00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:55,240
application if it's slower your

00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:58,180
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,550
and glasses you money keeping your

00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:04,300
business critical systems along you are

00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:07,000
insight into what they're doing your

00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:12,900
system metrics tells stories respective

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,900
formance bottlenecks other problems

00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:19,780
metrics real time and enjoyed this data

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:21,550
or leader analysis and hair volume the

00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,770
new way to see what's really going on

00:40:21,550 --> 00:40:25,960
under Article II the long view toward

00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:28,990
the to visualize the status all your

00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:33,369
system is really inside you learn to

00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:35,650
care for I see you in real processes

00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:38,260
load and network usage in a specific

00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:41,020
system to access its divisible dashboard

00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:43,720
and interact is amit on 12 points and

00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:46,950
get more detailed comprehensive network

00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:49,619

00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:53,550
and our cat and disk rights and free

00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:55,740

statistics or encouragement reserve

00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:04,170
system info tab and a global take out a

00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:05,910
moment to assign eyes just click the

00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,040
button copy the one line installation

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:12,390
command then on the command on your

00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:14,310
linux is Emma to break the process and

00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:19,079
sending it to longview then the graph

00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:21,930
start molding longview to gain a new

00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:26,609
server your website we're at guitar

00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:29,250
center since your brokers of everything

00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:33,060
you need to integrate manage automated

00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:35,369
virtual datacenter all of an anniversary

00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:37,829
in virtual platform and at a third of

00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:39,480
the cost on other selections but why I

00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,890
even bothered with virtualizing your

00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,099
server infrastructure in the first

00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:47,190
movies show me the traditional one sir

00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:49,579
that's one application you're running

00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:52,440
out of resources and performance aside

00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:56,040
once you order new server hardware you

00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,010
are away for delivery and figure install

00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:03,750
your place application these stage test

00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:05,730
the circuit rejection pretty if you've

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:08,460
been through this process before no one

00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:10,619
can take weeks or even months you also

00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:13,140
know it's manually intensive process

00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:16,849
their team every time you broke your

00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:19,170
current setup when the virtualization

00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:21,990
accomplish all of that in less than half

00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:24,839
turn a server virtualization software

00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:27,150
separates OS occupation in the

00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:29,250
underlying server particle and with

00:42:27,150 --> 00:42:34,380
multiple two machines on some server

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:36,420
yeah hosp relations this makes you

00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,950
products and our virtual machines from

00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,400
one piece of hardware to another

00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:43,819
everyone to maximize utilization super

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,819
00:42:44,069 --> 00:42:48,989
or go and without slowing down your

00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:51,559
applications or users click server

00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:55,380
virtualization you might recognize and

00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,869
citrix xenserver provides even since
