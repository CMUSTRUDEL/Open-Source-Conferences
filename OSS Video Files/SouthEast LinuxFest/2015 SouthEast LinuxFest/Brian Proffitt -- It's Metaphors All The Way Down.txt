so good afternoon welcome thank you very

00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:11,180
much for staying at this late day two at

00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:13,640
the southeast Lynn express my name is

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,780
Brian profit I am the community liaison

00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:20,320
for the overt project I'll be describing

00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:23,030
that a little bit more detail later on

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,690
thank you for your patience some and

00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:28,670
with this presentation it is new so feel

00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:31,280
free I believe in the open source

00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,989
feedback model so at the end when you

00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,850
have questions you can also have

00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:38,570
critiques and comments and whatnot and

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:43,520
let me know what you thought and we can

00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:47,899
make it better so this is one of those

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,780
talks that turned into a much larger

00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:54,170
thing like the linux kernel itself it

00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:56,210
started off with a small idea in that

00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,940
every time that I would do a talk about

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,100
overt which is a virtual data center

00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:03,469
management program I would have to

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:06,590
immediately compare it to what is known

00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:09,399
as cloud computing because they are

00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:11,920
while they share many characteristics as

00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:15,170
platforms for managing virtual machines

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,179
these are not necessarily the same kinds

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:23,020
of things so Randy bias had come up with

00:01:20,179 --> 00:01:27,729
what is probably a fairly familiar

00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,770
euphemism that's that in a data center

00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:34,399
you treat your virtual machines as pets

00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:38,779
and in the cloud that you treat them as

00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:41,090
cattle and me being the smart aleck that

00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:42,469
I am you know I kept coming up with

00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:44,450
different ways of describing that

00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:46,849
because I thought wow if you're an

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,149
animal rights person that that that kind

00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:53,029
of thing just sucks so I wanted to say

00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:56,209
okay so let's do the vegan way of doing

00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:58,489
it which would be so the virtual machine

00:01:56,209 --> 00:02:03,349
management and the data center is more

00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:06,799
like heirloom tomatoes and the cloud is

00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:08,869
like a field of soybeans so it's they're

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,610
still plants you're still consuming them

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,710
but you're doing it in a totally

00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:13,970
different way and managing it that way

00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:16,940
so that's sort of

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,220
secret super secret origin of this talk

00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:21,740
and that it's kind of built into

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,800
something much larger because as I talk

00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,630
to everybody in this community both

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,600
within the open source community and

00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:32,180
without the open source community there

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,890
are a lot of similarities and patterns

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:38,450
in what we do in IT that kind of make

00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:41,210
you make you want to stand back and say

00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,970
well there's something more to what

00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:52,340
we're doing here so I'm presenting this

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:53,690
idea okay so once upon a time because

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:55,520
you can't have a metaphor without a

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,010
story because basically a metaphor is a

00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,990
story we had the pretty little unicorn

00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,780
running to the force these things are

00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:05,810
going to kill us all right I don't know

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:09,590
why when I look for this image who it

00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,990
was scary so so maybe not this once upon

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,170
a time maybe let's get back really far

00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:19,040
once upon a time okay so let's go back

00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:22,310
to the beginning of humankind okay and

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,220
know how that you know how the culture

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:28,220
evolved at the time where you had what

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,860
scientists believed were a nomadic tribe

00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,959
of people not really into agriculture

00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,209
mostly doing a lot of hunting and

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,250
gathering you know and and fishing and

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:39,290
whatnot not really staying in one place

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,459
because this is well before the dawn of

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:45,590
Agriculture okay so this is like really

00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:48,850
far back there's no there's no fairy

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:53,480
tales here as far as this story goes

00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:58,690
people had to eat okay that's pretty

00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:01,549
much a given we you me me we have to eat

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,320
some of the sweet good thing some of

00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:07,870
those sweet bad things but that's

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:11,209
another story but we all had to eat and

00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:13,940
without really a big amount of

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,650
structured language scientists describe

00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,229
this as proto-language at this point

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,570
where you you know like animals there

00:04:18,229 --> 00:04:23,390
are some basic signals and things

00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:25,580
getting a crust between the humans in

00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,540
these tribes and we're talking about

00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,760
probably even pre

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:34,230
Homo sapiens so not even really humans

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,870
at this point okay but generally there

00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:39,000
was not really a lot of real language in

00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,950
a sophisticated way now some would argue

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,630
that that's not the case and I'm not

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,170
going to get into that right now but

00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:51,140
that we can all agree people had to eat

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:55,770
okay and this wasn't a thing yet okay

00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:57,750
this is amazing when I travel now for my

00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,760
job and I go out and talk to people in

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,890
various places around the world I could

00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,350
not imagine the world and i can because

00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:08,040
i'm old imagining a world like this

00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:11,280
without this is it difficult I can't

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,050
imagine how things are done you know my

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,700
mom still has a like on actual paper

00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:18,480
Road Atlas in the backseat of her car

00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:21,120
and I'm like what you know but phones

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:24,450
breaks she say so you know good for her

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,310
so this wasn't a thing cavemen didn't

00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,960
have anything remotely like this they

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,660
didn't even have basically rudimentary

00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,880
mapping skills or or geometric skills to

00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,140
sort of you know get the point across as

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,910
where things were so this was the thing

00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,710
so these you've seen ancient cave art

00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,070
various caves I believe these are the

00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:45,540
ones from the the famous caves in France

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:50,550
whose name I unfortunately can't

00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:56,640
pronounce this thank you very much he

00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:59,700
gets a star so um this is what they were

00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,740
for okay this wasn't just like hey I'm

00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,480
going to paint pretty pictures of you

00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,720
know deer and antelope and cattle or

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:10,200
mammoths or whatever this was actually

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,720
survival okay yet they this was telling

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,850
a story they were using what little

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,620
language they had they were using what

00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,100
little artistic skills they had and they

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:23,810
were really trying to innovate here and

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:28,070
build ways to describe to themselves and

00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:31,440
more importantly to the next generations

00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:34,620
okay they had to pass this generational

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,320
knowledge on an artwork was even better

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:40,740
at language what language they had

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,440
because it was more permanent

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,050
and it was more static and you can get

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:50,490
the ideas across so storytelling was

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:53,190
very much a survival tactic now let's

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,509
let's levu just fast forward we get in

00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,690
the way back machine we're coming up

00:06:54,509 --> 00:07:00,630
here we are the 21st century where there

00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:04,680
are no flying cars I'm not bitter really

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:06,539
but but okay so here we are we're in the

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,139
21st century and and that's well and

00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:13,349
good and storytelling today is pretty

00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:17,310
much what we would consider an artistic

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:19,110
form you know I used to love it because

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,120
when I got started in this industry I

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,710
was writing books about linux and I

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,900
would love to do this i would go to

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,880
parties you know when my wife would let

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,919
me out of the house and i cleaned up

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,419
well enough and i would go to parties

00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,130
and they would say oh what do you would

00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:35,250
do and i would love to say oh I'm a book

00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,569
I'm an author you know and I I didn't go

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,639
as far as getting me another tweed

00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,289
jacket with the letter you know patches

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,789
in the pipe in anything like that but

00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:43,440
you know it's kind of cool you don't say

00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,979
yeah I'm gonna out there there's a

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,360
little cash a there logistic flavor to

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:50,039
the job and then of course they'd say

00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,229
well what do you write and I would tell

00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:54,210
them and it's like the light just went

00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:57,560
out of their heads you know I write

00:07:54,210 --> 00:08:00,180
books about linux and they're like oh so

00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,690
so there I am standing by the chip dip

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,360
on myself yeah well okay but there is an

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,550
artistic cash age of storytelling we

00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,280
value our storytellers whether they are

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:13,590
using the medium of video or you know

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,560
audio podcasts which are coming back in

00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:20,909
a great way or the written word okay

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,430
story telling is art and we say that all

00:08:20,909 --> 00:08:25,740
the time I think that's something we

00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,110
pretty much agree on but what I want to

00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,329
just to kind of explore a little bit is

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:35,490
that it's not just about art its present

00:08:33,329 --> 00:08:39,149
in a lot of what we would consider maybe

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:43,349
more utilitarian ways and we as a

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:49,199
community are very much a part of actual

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:51,360
storytelling so every story worth its

00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:54,130
salt has the use of metaphors and

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,620
similes and other literary tools

00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,380
you know get the point across so you see

00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,820
this picture and say you look at it a

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,200
while and you probably have intuited

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,430
this is something along the lines of

00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:11,350
time is money okay and if not time is

00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:14,050
money it's also sleepy time and I you

00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,050
know I can't get that in there so time

00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:19,000
is money it's a metaphor we get that in

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,890
our culture other cultures have

00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,220
different metaphors obviously I'm being

00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,420
english-centric right now but there are

00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:26,890
different metaphors in different

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,770
cultures and different language sets

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,500
that people understand they understand

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,450
the meaning of time as money and there

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:38,170
are other you know more sophisticated

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:40,480
and more specialized metaphors too if I

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:42,990
were to say to you that perhaps the

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,120
earth was being visited by a very large

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,520
artificial object with maybe perhaps one

00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,290
third the mass of the moon and it was in

00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:53,200
orbit and it had a very large

00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,000
destructive ray gun device in it and I

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,060
go on and on and on about the technical

00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,920
specs about this okay you may have

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,480
gotten the message that this might be

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,630
something we were worried about but in

00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:10,210
our culture I could say something more

00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:12,460
simplified like that okay if I say

00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,900
that's no moon pretty much anybody who's

00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,670
seen in moving the last two and eight

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:18,760
twenty years is pretty much gonna say oh

00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,970
it's time to hide you know I'm get off

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,040
the planet boys and girls that's a

00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,960
metaphor we know what that is it's a

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,120
cultural reference that we understand

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:30,490
it's very simplified but we know what

00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,940
that line means that means the danger

00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:36,190
there it's disguised it appears to be

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:37,960
something else but it's clearly a much

00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,000
more imminent threat that we should pay

00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:44,320
attention to and it's just one line from

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,690
a movie but it permeates some part of

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,620
our culture maybe not everybody but

00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:54,399
people usually get this

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:57,430
software is the same way it's very hard

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,199
to describe software visually so I went

00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:02,769
back to one of these punch cards and I

00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,589
said okay so because for me I'm not this

00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:07,930
old but when I was kid before i would

00:11:05,589 --> 00:11:12,069
actually touch a computer this was still

00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:16,059
going on okay and so you know you have

00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:18,399
what is very much abstract

00:11:16,059 --> 00:11:21,309
representations hugely abstract

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,860
representations of data and information

00:11:21,309 --> 00:11:25,709
that are represented on punch cards and

00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,059
there are a whole mass of other

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:31,809
interfaces that I couldn't even show you

00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:33,999
here and what's important to understand

00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:37,629
here even from the very beginning we're

00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:41,139
clearly there's a huge need to get this

00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:43,240
into English or French or whatever human

00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:45,459
language is a better way to describe it

00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:49,779
we have to get that into human language

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:54,009
and that requires storytelling it

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:57,160
requires metaphors and similes and

00:11:54,009 --> 00:12:00,069
things to kind of help people understand

00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:09,579
why this is important and what it means

00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:11,110
and we do this every single day now I'm

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:14,850
going to bring up some examples of how

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:19,480
this sort of words sometimes we describe

00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:23,019
and use metaphors and similes and and

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,379
basic visual representations based on a

00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:28,509
kind of job so we have here one of the

00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:30,249
early versions of obscure jizz a

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:32,949
Christmas or Charles Dickens A Christmas

00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,470
Carol and we see my man Scrooge they're

00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:37,209
doing the hard work given Bob Cratchit

00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:39,910
the runaround and you know basically

00:12:37,209 --> 00:12:42,339
just making this life miserable and you

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:43,990
know their job in case you haven't read

00:12:42,339 --> 00:12:46,569
Dickens in a while there were money

00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,910
lenders basically and so there's a great

00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:50,920
deal of accounting and to do that kind

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:52,389
of accounting you have Scrooge sitting

00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,980
there at the desk with it you know the

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:56,350
one lump of coal in the stove because

00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:01,329
he's a mean stinky son of a ba ba ba ba

00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:02,660
ba and he's working on one of these the

00:13:01,329 --> 00:13:04,940
spreadsheet

00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:06,649
this is actually the prototype for the

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:07,970
spreadsheet this is a real world model

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:10,129
this ready today have you haven't seen

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:13,699
this this is actually a fairly small one

00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:16,069
but in in in the original use of these

00:13:13,699 --> 00:13:21,529
things some of these Ledger's got pretty

00:13:16,069 --> 00:13:23,870
big I I teach a course at Notre Dame on

00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:25,579
spreadsheets and for the business

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,439
students so because they pretty much

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:28,850
need to know how to use this stuff when

00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:31,399
they're doing their you know getting

00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,860
their undergraduate degree and I tell

00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:36,920
them you know here's here's what you

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:39,350
this is why we do this and they kind of

00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,370
understand it a little bit better the

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:46,189
fact that we have a page a book full of

00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:48,110
pages with rows and columns in them in

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:50,060
any and obviously in the original

00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:54,079
version you had to handwrite everything

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:56,930
and in black ink reading if you were

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,569
getting fancy to do negatives and you go

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,420
through that and do you t help you if

00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:04,670
you've got something wrong because I

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,769
like going into one cell now and just go

00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:08,569
and changing it like that no you had to

00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:14,389
basically rewrite the whole page

00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:18,439
sometimes if that happened ok so this it

00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:22,009
came and started so small this early

00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:23,839
representations of visicalc and and you

00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,310
can kind of see okay we've got the rose

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,730
in the cells we don't really have the

00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:32,240
pages and whatnot but we certainly do

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:35,569
now here's Libre Office a relatively

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,220
recent edition and this is calc okay and

00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:39,730
we see it in Excel on any of the other

00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:45,170
spreadsheet programs that are out there

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:47,029
basically you have your page along the

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,370
bottom a little hard to see but there in

00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:52,309
those colored tabs down there those are

00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,220
individual pages worksheets within a

00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,699
workbook and I take the time to explain

00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:00,769
this to my students because they need to

00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:04,279
understand the metaphor that's going on

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:07,790
here the the whole spreadsheet concept

00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:10,220
was basically mimicking a real world

00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,790
object and turning it into something

00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:15,830
that people could understand

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:17,840
and if you step back and think about it

00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:20,390
there's two ways of approaching that one

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,690
is well of course they did that's the

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:25,250
easiest way why wouldn't they do it that

00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:27,890
way and indeed why wouldn't a but the

00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:32,150
other thing that kind of really tickles

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:35,600
my fancy a little bit is that why didn't

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:39,050
they go another way is there another way

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,080
to represent mathematical accounting

00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:43,210
it's not calculus or anything so

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:45,590
accounting and our arithmetic

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,530
calculations in a way that conveys the

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:52,040
information the same way why are we

00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:55,340
stuck on this metaphor the answer is

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:58,280
probably it's a pretty good metaphor you

00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,310
know it's relatively intuitive once you

00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,040
point it out but how many of you have

00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:06,740
like remember that it is a workbook

00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:10,280
holding worksheets and things like that

00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:12,500
see we use it but we don't we don't know

00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:16,520
it sometimes this is a problem with our

00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:20,000
technology it comes up to four so that's

00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:25,280
the origin of the spreadsheet sometimes

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,860
the interface is dictated by or dictates

00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:30,080
the metaphor so this is an early Xerox

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,510
PARC representation one of the earliest

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:35,060
gooeys that they existed out there and I

00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,180
tried to find something that was as cool

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:43,130
and and nifty looking as I could and in

00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:46,430
so the idea at New York's Xerox PARC GUI

00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:48,260
was to try to convey a lot of visual

00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,930
information using this new thing called

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:53,030
the mouse and working with the keyboard

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,520
and getting this visually across and so

00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:57,800
they were adopting a new metaphor which

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,770
if you really really think about it

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,600
makes no sense the only part of this

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,420
metaphor that makes sense to me is the

00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:07,820
desktop okay yeah it's the desktop I

00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:11,630
took my desktop here and I put it up

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,010
here okay that makes sense but then when

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,170
you start looking at the individual

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:19,190
terminology then you're like wait what

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:22,160
you know because now it's windows it's

00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:24,970
basically wimp you know the wimp

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,600
interface basically controls everything

00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:29,370
so you've got windows and menus

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,350
radio buttons and things like that and

00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:33,690
if you think about it it's like radio

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:40,100
buttons how many people actually know

00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:40,100
what a radio button really is one yeah

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,220
