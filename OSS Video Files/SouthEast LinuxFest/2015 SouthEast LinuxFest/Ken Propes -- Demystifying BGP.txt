yes we can okay welcome to the southeast

00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:07,310
linux fest 2015 this is the third in a

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,590
series of discussions concerning routing

00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,300
the first one we didn't get to see the

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,510
second one was done just before here

00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,290
which was entitled demystifying routing

00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:20,480
and now we're going to talk about the

00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:22,820
BGP protocol which is the big boy

00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,800
protocol in network my name is Ken

00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:26,900
Propst and I'll be your moderator and

00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,729
speaker for the next hour hopefully your

00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,650
heads won't explode but I do expect to

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,970
be some damage to the mental capacities

00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,400
when you start looking through all of

00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:37,700
this stuff because it can get very very

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,770
complex now this presentation is also

00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,479
being hosted and is available to you at

00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,140
this grimoire link that you can see at

00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,850
the bottom of the slide okay without any

00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:51,200
further ado let's start into the

00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:55,700
beginnings of BGP this protocol is one

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,130
that actually is the been evolving for

00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,810
quite some time we actually call it BGP

00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:04,640
for because its version for right now

00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:06,649
fully defined by that RSC 4271 and the

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,300
reason that BGP is important is when

00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:10,910
you're routing a lot of things over the

00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,950
Internet big is important a lot of

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:14,870
bandwidth is important and having a

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:20,180
routing protocol that can handle a

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:21,680
number of individuals and ISPs and all

00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,150
kinds of networks and put them all

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,120
together so that they move seamlessly

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:28,910
across the world is a pretty tough job

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,550
bgp is up to that job it is the most

00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:34,819
scalable protocol it is a path vector

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:38,600
protocol some of the other protocols for

00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:40,430
ospf or is is are using different kinds

00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,530
of measurements of metrics to decide

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,560
what do i do with a packet and where do

00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:48,980
i decide to send it out but this one is

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,440
one that is event-driven and instead of

00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,870
sending out the entirety of my routing

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,170
table to my neighbors this one looks for

00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:59,170
incremental updates we have a question

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:11,010
so the question has to do with Malaysia

00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,689
and what happened yesterday which I'm

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,340
not aware of sending the whole routing

00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:26,989
table out and blowing up a lot of the

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:26,989
internet so a s700 7 is a bad boy

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:54,610
well so that was a bad boy and I could

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,439
not even hope to repeat all of that

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,180
unfortunately don't have you Mike there

00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:59,950
but we'll talk a little bit about how

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,049
you can go about screwing up the

00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:04,930
internet by using some of the elements

00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:09,000
in BGP protocol that comes a little bit

00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:11,170
later in the discussion okay uh

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,150
incremental updates or what gets sent

00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,739
out as a part of this protocol unless

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:16,959
everything blows up and have to start

00:04:14,739 --> 00:04:19,269
from scratch in that case you will

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,130
expose the entirety of the routing table

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:24,669
that you've got in your particular

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:27,520
router so bgp covers a lot more than

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,650
just layer 3 routing it's used in a lot

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,930
of different areas including layer two

00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:35,020
things like ppl esas virtual private

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,860
land services virtual leased lines uh

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:42,490
and even bgp or mpls so there's a lot of

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,010
things that bgp does uh and a lot of

00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,990
names that you'll see on bgp so in

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,900
addition to this bgp for that will be

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,870
talking about it is an external or ebgp

00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,610
protocol that i plan to focus on but

00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,979
there's also an internal version of this

00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:59,889
which is will describe one that's used

00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:01,660
inside autonomous systems and mochi

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:03,849
protocol bgp so there's a lot of

00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,260
different things which could take up a

00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,740
lot more time than we have today and

00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:12,070
we're going to focus on ipv4 not ipv6

00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,940
we're going to focus on ebgp version 4

00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:19,840
and the internet now the internet is a

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,389
rather large thing and here in 2003 we

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,520
have a picture of what the internet was

00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,830
look to be when someone took the time to

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,599
try to trace the routes and the prefixes

00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,210
and see how they were interconnected and

00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:33,099
who's doing what to whom and the various

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,699
colors in this thing you can see which

00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:39,639
of the rirs or the Rachel of Internet

00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,380
authorities are are hosting or putting

00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,159
together traffic that goes across the

00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,349
Internet asia-pacific there in red North

00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:49,599
America in blue and so forth and so on

00:05:47,349 --> 00:05:52,330
and a lot of them that are really not

00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,480
traceable or unknown than showing up in

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,600
white

00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:59,420
the point here is the internet is large

00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,130
and because it's large you're going to

00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:03,650
have to have something that has the the

00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,450
processing power and the memory space to

00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,540
be able to handle a large number of

00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:10,100
addresses and that's what bgp does over

00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:12,830
the years routers have evolved to have

00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:15,710
better and better memory sizes cpu

00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:17,810
processing capabilities and it's uh it's

00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:21,830
gotten up to the task to be able to do

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,960
that but advertising each and every

00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,030
address that is in the internet is just

00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,680
simply not feasible not possible and we

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,170
really need a way to skinny that

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,990
information down and what we talked

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:35,990
about in the prior uh talk on mr.

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:38,480
demystifying routing is to use subnet

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,280
addresses and only advertise the most

00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,940
condensed version of what you need to

00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:45,380
advertise so once you do skinny that

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,260
down then you get down to something

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,890
that's a little more reasonable to route

00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:54,050
across the network so each isp whether

00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:57,410
you be a tier one vendor or tier two

00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,470
vendor or whatever your size is somehow

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:03,290
winds up getting your traffic aggregated

00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:05,900
and going across the internet and cheer

00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:11,300
one ISPs like those listed here ATT

00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:13,700
verizon CenturyLink NTT a many other all

00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:15,440
their those guys are the big guys in the

00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,720
network and they form the actual

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,610
internet backbone and they connect to

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,490
each other in ways that are different

00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:24,440
from your local ISP who maybe doesn't

00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:27,560
have the scale in the scope to do such

00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,940
things there are tier two isps which are

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,100
a little bit larger than the big boys

00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,670
but still have a significant network and

00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:36,890
tier two isps participate in this border

00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,590
gateway protocol as well because they're

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:42,080
representing a collection of their

00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:45,770
constituents or their customers in that

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,470
collection is is put into the internet

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:50,570
through a common policy bgp handles that

00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:53,030
quite well but there's even some large

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,890
companies companies that are large

00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:57,380
enough to have their own network across

00:07:54,890 --> 00:08:00,860
the united states across the globe and

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:02,570
they too need to participate in BGP so

00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,020
depending on the size and scope of what

00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:07,400
the the ISP is you'll find that a lot of

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,600
them use BGP

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,710
you at your home do not need to use BGP

00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:15,650
so how does all this interconnection

00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,020
work there's a concept called pairing

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,660
and in peering this is where we take

00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,570
these networks and connect them together

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,610
at a point called an internet exchange

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:29,720
point in this example here we've got

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:31,699
three large ISPs west net mid net and

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,890
East net and each of these guys

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:35,510
represent their constituents as you can

00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,849
see from the little clouds below and

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,240
what they're doing is they're setting up

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,330
a BGP peering each of these routers has

00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,550
a gateway protocol running on their edge

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,520
router and that gateway protocol talks

00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,560
across in a specific way in order to

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,279
exchange routes that he knows for

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,839
example the West nap in green is taking

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,990
his information saying I'm gonna give

00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:02,920
that over to my peer med and give them

00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:06,230
all that I know in my routing table and

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:08,089
mid net knows about the two guys on each

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,670
side and he'll take those routing things

00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:12,709
and put it into his routing table so

00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:14,390
that he sees what's going on on East End

00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:15,860
and sees what's going on west that and

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,080
because he's the guy interconnected

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,940
between the two he's the guy that's got

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,610
the ability to see where traffic needs

00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,100
to go among those so when you get into a

00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:29,060
peering point or internet exchange point

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,310
you begin to get a lot of individual

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:33,380
large dear what is peas connected

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,390
together in a switch at a layer 2 and

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,490
they can then talk and see each other

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,010
and have this giant meeting point at

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,020
this stage of the game we're not talking

00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,450
about Gigabit Ethernet and we're

00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,370
probably getting way beyond 10 Gigabit

00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:49,360
Ethernet and 200 Gigabit Ethernet

00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:53,750
connections I know that there is also

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,490
plans for using 400 gig Ethernet it's

00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:57,260
not yet available the standards aren't

00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,200
quite finished but I know that the

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:02,480
routers are being proposed and some that

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,779
already exists that can handle that kind

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,520
of a routing and in the card so the big

00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,470
boy routers are the guys that are going

00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,900
to be running BGP but you don't have to

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,019
be a big boy to run BGP if you've got a

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:18,420
need to it stud I need to do so

00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,610
so these entries into the BGP routing

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:23,329
table where we're forwarding these these

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,129
active addresses these prefixes

00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:29,639
continues to grow so when I last checked

00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:31,589
it was 550 7,000 and change our the

00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:33,689
number of these entries that can go into

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:35,970
a routing database so if you're one of

00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:38,309
those tier 1 ISPs at the top of the food

00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:41,819
chain you're gonna be having a lot of

00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:43,110
entries into your routing table that

00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:44,549
means you gotta have a lot of memory in

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,199
a router you gotta have a lot of

00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:48,689
processing power to take care of these

00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:50,819
and when each of these neighbors as a

00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,559
problem and it goes down and you gotta

00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:54,449
start processing a great deal more

00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,459
information you're gonna be in trouble

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:58,829
if you don't have that processing power

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:12,690
or their memory to hold it all we have a

00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:14,520
question yep last

00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,320
about the verizon problem that happened

00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,600
last year when they were d aggregating

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,670
meaning they took what was a condensed

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:23,220
set of addresses and broke them into a

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,400
smaller subset of addresses and what

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,500
that did to the cisco catalyst 6500 i

00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,210
believe in the case of that the

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,010
intention when those things first came

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:36,000
out and the catalyst is what 10 years

00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,530
old and it is a switch but you can put

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,140
routing blades into that switch i

00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:42,360
believe nonetheless the problem is that

00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,710
at the time that switch was conceived in

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,960
the memory that was put inside there

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:48,900
they assume they've never get to 512

00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,390
thousand entries and once the net got

00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:54,060
too big and you try to import too many

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,670
more problems happened things went down

00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:58,800
so it wasn't that the fault that verizon

00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,170
did it it was that nobody thought that

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,510
we would get to that point and this is

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,310
making my point thank you very much of

00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:08,430
why it's important to have a protocol

00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:10,170
and the memory and the processing power

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,120
and these routers to be able to handle

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,980
the size of the internet it will

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,470
continue to grow this little curve that

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,120
you see all the on the chart here isn't

00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:21,770
beginning to fall over as far as I can

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:26,310
tell it's still on a pace to keep going

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:28,920
and that is only the v4 stuff exactly so

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,480
if we look at ipv6 which is finally

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,670
getting some traction and coming along

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,490
the routers must handle those as well at

00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,950
the same time so it's a pretty tricky

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:41,430
problem to handle and that's why i call

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,680
them big boy routers okay so let's go to

00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:46,170
the next one here and talk about what is

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,780
it that makes us be able to handle this

00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:51,180
this is a concept called autonomous

00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,700
system and an autonomous system is

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,250
something that has the four attributes

00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,160
as you see here when it's a collection

00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,380
of IP routing prefixes it's administered

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,860
by one or more network operators who are

00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,140
acting on behalf of a single entity this

00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,839
kind of defines a large ISP or large

00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:12,510
organization and the most important of

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,690
this is this autonomous system presents

00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:18,900
a clearly defined routing policy to all

00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:21,960
of the other a esas so he represents all

00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:25,740
the entities within and that border

00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,740
gateway router is putting

00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,300
the policies that determine how all the

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,880
traffic coming into this autonomous

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:35,760
system get routed out of it to the

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,540
neighbors and this allows them to

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:42,960
simplify and make a large is B territory

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,850
or manageable so each autonomous system

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,760
is something that is a well-known

00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:50,220
attribute you have to get an assigned

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:54,030
number and each number that's a sign is

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:56,760
done by your local internet registry it

00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:58,830
helps reduce these numbers of prefixes

00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,210
so that you don't overwhelm the routers

00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:04,470
and you don't get into the problem that

00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:08,730
we just described so I IaaS numbers come

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:11,430
from the individual entities just like

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,980
you get IP addresses a sign you also get

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:18,120
a s numbers assigned from these regional

00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,030
authorities so in in this diagram here

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,250
there are a number of increases in the

00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:26,790
number of a esas by these regional

00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,560
internet registry authorities and if it

00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:32,010
were a race right here the guys in green

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,230
which is us being overtaken by the guys

00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:36,630
in blue which is Europe and so I

00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,040
encourage you to make more a esas we're

00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:40,260
losing the battle here we need to kind

00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,960
of pick up the pace we cannot let those

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,770
guys beat us we have some questions

00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:45,770
first here

00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,949
getting more a esas where they need it

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:06,259
but they're already leading that's how

00:15:03,949 --> 00:15:09,350
we suppress them we don't let them have

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:20,179
the a s addresses and we win another

00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:22,399
question back here so the comment is

00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:24,499
that in the problem in yours Europe is

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,279
that each country has a huge number of

00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:30,470
ISPs each with their own little fiefdom

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,299
entry routing tables and they all need a

00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:34,220
SS so that's why their commanding so

00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,809
many to make their system work that's

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,379
not the only problem in Europe but

00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:40,999
that's the talk of a different type so

00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:43,040
when we first started out with a s

00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:47,389
numbers there was only 16 bit numbers

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:50,959
and this thing went up to about 65535 I

00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:52,910
believe it is that's what 16 22 the 16

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,389
turns out to be clearly that wasn't

00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,399
enough and now we've gone to 32-bit

00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:02,059
addresses so we go up over 4 billion of

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,819
those things so as bgp of all's you had

00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:05,689
to evolve to be able to handle these

00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:08,480
differences and that's one of the things

00:16:05,689 --> 00:16:10,999
that it's done but in looking at this

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,660
thing right now by 2014 it said that

00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:17,240
over 47,000 unique ASNs were active in

00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,949
the network not a sign this is the

00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:22,610
number of assigned addresses which as

00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:25,670
you can see is at 70,000 total but only

00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:28,600
47 thousand active shows somebody is

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:31,040
hoarding addresses never a good thing

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,199
now seriously you assigned them in

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,899
anticipation of things happening and it

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,179
doesn't necessarily happen so as you can

00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:40,249
clearly see here peering of ISPs is a

00:16:38,179 --> 00:16:42,559
nice thing to do so each one of these

00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:47,029
little clouds represents an AS and I've

00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:49,339
faked in some AS numbers uh as400 for

00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:52,429
the green one on the upper left and he's

00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:55,699
talking to a s number six a 500 and the

00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:58,160
gold on the right and those two guys are

00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:02,239
talking at an interne internet exchange

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:04,459
point using bgp protocol and each one of

00:17:02,239 --> 00:17:09,169
those guys in turn are talking to others

00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:12,110
tier 2 isp providers a very respective

00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:13,730
assigned a s numbers and those guys in

00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,510
turn are talking to either their large

00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,140
customers

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:20,480
tr3 ISPs and so on and so on but each of

00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,459
these because of the scale and the scope

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,339
of what they're doing in their own cloud

00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:28,250
has their own assigned a s number and

00:17:25,339 --> 00:17:31,400
the point about be a BGP is or we're

00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:33,800
trying to do is don't look at so much of

00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:36,260
what's going on throw it into the a s

00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,210
let the autonomous system handle it and

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,030
move it within its borders using its own

00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:43,250
policies you still have to look at all

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,470
the possible addresses you still need to

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,990
know what you can see from your router's

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:50,540
but you try to let the a s take care

00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:52,940
some of the heavy load and the problem

00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,650
of doing all of this is you've got to

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:57,260
have a grievance and part of the

00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:59,030
agreements are well let's see i'll give

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:01,070
you my traffic you'll you'll give me

00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:03,020
yours and you want that agreement to be

00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,060
bi-directional you want to get something

00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:08,630
you want the addresses in the traffic

00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:11,450
there's coming from customer a RI as400

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:15,350
to be about equal to or as advantageous

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:18,230
as the addresses come from a s500 if

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:20,780
it's not then the cost of the expense

00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,580
that each of these individual ISPs bears

00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,830
and they bear their own expense for the

00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:26,420
routing ports and the connections

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,110
between them those costs and expenses

00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:32,660
are not equal so occasionally you'll

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,610
find cases where you got a little ISP

00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,350
and he wants to get into the internet

00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:39,020
but he's not got anything offered in

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:41,720
those cases unlike the ixp were no money

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:44,090
changes hands you may have the smaller

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,300
lesser ISPs having to pay money to get

00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:49,910
access to the internet because that's

00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:52,790
what they have to do the big boys at the

00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:54,670
top there the cost equally and share it

00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,830
and the little guys down at the bottom

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:59,870
don't have the scale and scope to do so

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,330
but they pay for that internet access in

00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:05,120
all of those cases were still using BGP

00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:07,790
as a protocol to make them talk do we

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,170
have any heads exploded yet I see no

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:14,320
blood on the carpet will move on

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:16,210
so as you get into looking across the

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,100
internet and the tier 1 networks and the

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,890
tier 2 networks it gets to be quite a

00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:23,470
jumble of things and these jumble things

00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:25,870
get into a lot of interesting situations

00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:28,420
and some of the situations have to do

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,400
with well I really don't want to trust

00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,080
this internet service provider with all

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,750
about traffic because they got a little

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,090
flaky last year and I think I'm going to

00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:40,150
make a secondary connection to the

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,190
internet through a different isp so I'm

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,990
going to do a home my connections into

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,060
both of them and you'll see some of

00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:48,190
those things multihomed and so forth and

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,170
so the routing protocol gets a little

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,090
more complex because now you don't want

00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:54,490
to advertise all your routes here and

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:55,720
all your routes here because those guys

00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,310
are going to try to advertise their

00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:59,830
routes across to each other and pretty

00:19:57,310 --> 00:20:01,870
soon you get into a loop and looping is

00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:04,480
bad and that's something you don't want

00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:06,100
to do so we do try to avoid that and

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,440
they have to take advantage of the

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,440
things inside BGP to make sure that

00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,270
doesn't happen and we'll we'll touch on

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,510
that but that gets deep deep into it

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:18,940
nonetheless it's very very complex it's

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,590
very very difficult but the BG protocol

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:22,390
itself handles it well and it's fairly

00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:24,880
simple to do if you just follow the

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:28,870
rules so let's talk about some of the

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,540
concepts that have to do with bgp bgp

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:34,210
runs on a nice clean finite state

00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:36,130
machine and that's used to establish the

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,650
communications between the two peers

00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:42,580
called neighbors each of which has their

00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:45,160
own autonomous system number and unlike

00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:48,850
some of the other protocols ospf or is

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:50,230
is we use TCP to set that connection

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,610
because you really kind of want to make

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,350
sure that's a good connection and that

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:56,350
it's giving you good information back

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,750
and forth and in the process of doing

00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,900
this finite table TCP is an integral

00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:03,130
part to start everything off the second

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,810
thing you want to do is you want to make

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,270
sure that you've got an agreed set of

00:21:04,810 --> 00:21:09,910
conditions because bgp has a number of

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,230
options list them all the way down you

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:13,450
need to make sure that the options

00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:15,670
you're choosing to use match the options

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,470
that the other guys choosing to use he

00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:19,240
may have an older router he may not be

00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:21,220
able to go all the way up to the latest

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,440
and greatest so you get to a common

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,909
level that both routers can handle and

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,129
you set those as

00:21:24,909 --> 00:21:28,779
your greed set of attributes so that as

00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:30,519
those things are exchanged you lock in

00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,899
and that's how you're going to be doing

00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:34,869
the real routing part which is

00:21:31,899 --> 00:21:37,090
exchanging the messages and to chief

00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:39,789
messages that come back and forth once

00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,679
you've established this period are keep

00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:43,179
alives which says if I don't have

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,970
anything new to tell you I'm still going

00:21:43,179 --> 00:21:48,369
to send you a keepalive keep alive comes

00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:52,389
out anywhere from 30 seconds to 1 minute

00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:54,970
and we have a whole timer that says I'll

00:21:52,389 --> 00:21:58,119
be about three times that keep-alive

00:21:54,970 --> 00:22:00,820
timer so that we can make sure

00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,099
something's wrong but we don't make sure

00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:06,450
it's very wrong very fast what I mean by

00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:09,159
that is by having a long long time

00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:11,019
before you decide that it's good i need

00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,989
to send to keep alive and 30 seconds to

00:22:11,019 --> 00:22:15,639
a minute in internet time is a long time

00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:18,519
especially if you're running a hundred

00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:21,849
gigabit pipe 100 gigabits per second

00:22:18,519 --> 00:22:23,229
waiting for 60 seconds you've lost a lot

00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:26,859
of traffic if things aren't working well

00:22:23,229 --> 00:22:29,379
but the idea of the BGP is we want to

00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:31,149
detect a fault but we don't want to play

00:22:29,379 --> 00:22:32,830
with things that start routing and if

00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:34,299
somebody does something weird and the

00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:36,820
router is going up and down the

00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:38,830
interface is up and down you don't want

00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,139
to be transmitting all those changes up

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:43,479
there down to all the other peers that

00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:45,849
you talk to so that timer is set

00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:47,859
purposefully to be slow unlike the

00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:50,259
timers that you'd see and lesser

00:22:47,859 --> 00:22:51,759
protocols ospf for example where that

00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:54,220
timer is set to a little bit shorter

00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,349
time because you want to reconfigure and

00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,529
you want to get the the network back up

00:22:56,349 --> 00:23:01,239
as quickly as you can alright so mention

00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:04,779
that we run a finite state machine let's

00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:07,299
look at what that statement shame is the

00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:09,429
bottom left is the bad place to be and

00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,109
the upper right at the top is the good

00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,460
place to be bottom left is where we

00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:15,609
start everything off and that is the

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:17,919
idle state if something goes wrong are

00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:20,979
you violate something or the network

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,869
goes down or your router goes down you

00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:24,729
knocked down the BGP connection you

00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:26,979
start all over again so there's a lot of

00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:28,509
arrows that point back to idle see how

00:23:26,979 --> 00:23:30,909
many different ways you can go to idle

00:23:28,509 --> 00:23:32,320
six different ways their idol is not

00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:35,229
good but it just says that we're

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,090
starting everything right from the base

00:23:35,229 --> 00:23:40,250
of let's establish the handshake for TC

00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,010
p and then let's establish the handshake

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,929
for bgp where we exchange parameters

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,490
decide that we're going to talk decide

00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:48,590
which parameters were using and what

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,539
those numbers are and then we can begin

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,970
actually doing routing exchanging

00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:55,130
routing information so once you've gone

00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,650
through this step of connect and active

00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:00,049
that's the part where you're actually

00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:03,650
establishing and negotiating the tcp

00:24:00,049 --> 00:24:05,809
parameters you you begin to move up the

00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:09,320
chain if you're not able to establish

00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:12,110
tcp you go back to the penalty box idle

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,659
or connect so these things described and

00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:16,520
very good detail how you build a router

00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,740
so that it comes up and established it

00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,590
once you've got TCP you move up the

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:24,890
chain into two other messages one called

00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:27,710
open sent and open confirm when we're

00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:30,350
sending an open sent that means I've

00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:31,929
established that i can see somebody over

00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:34,070
there and i'm going to take the

00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:36,559
parameters that were configured into the

00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:38,600
router and send them over to my peer and

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,010
hopefully he's going to agree that those

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,899
parameters are the ones that he can

00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,149
handle and we're going to be able to

00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:46,730
make make our connections once the other

00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:49,190
riders router sends information back and

00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,720
says open confirm we're now talking and

00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,399
we finally get to move up and to the

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,159
point where BGP is actually doing

00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:57,830
routing and that's the established state

00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:00,230
so as the network changes as conditions

00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,539
change as problems occur as they always

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:05,090
do in a network and a link goes down or

00:25:02,539 --> 00:25:06,350
router goes down something happens you

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,110
may go through all of these different

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,390
stages and having to bring this BGP

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:13,130
protocol back up once you've got to the

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,840
established date you're in good shape

00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:17,600
and you're ready to move on to the next

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:21,260
stage which is operating like a router

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,409
using the BGP protocol so each of these

00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:26,419
neighbors when they're giving you routes

00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:30,049
and giving you information or call

00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:33,679
speakers so BGP speakers talk through

00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:35,899
that vgp protocol once they get the

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,970
information from their neighbors they

00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:39,649
then look at that information through a

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,460
set of criteria and try to establish

00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:45,679
what is the best path to get all these

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,830
routes that I see from this neighbor out

00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,900
to the rest of the Internet

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:53,420
installs that best path path into a

00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,340
routing information base or rib and this

00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,430
is kind of generic for all routers that

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,380
rib is saying here's all the stuff that

00:25:58,430 --> 00:26:02,180
I know that's out there but it's not

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,700
necessarily all the stuff that I'm going

00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:06,680
to send to my peers because I may know

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:09,860
something or I may have some policies in

00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:12,320
play or may have some preferences that I

00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,200
want to use to steer the traffic in one

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,180
way or another way sometimes this is

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,550
done for good and sometimes as we heard

00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,680
are these already this morning it's not

00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:24,020
always done for good we've had countries

00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:27,620
who didn't want to let their users get

00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:31,460
to a particular website back Pakistan

00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:34,640
and what was and YouTube as is a clear

00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,970
example several years ago and that

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,120
disrupts the force bad things happen

00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:43,220
when you do that so sometimes when you

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,950
do that unexpected things can happen and

00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,780
you disturb the internet connections as

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:49,640
a whole so you got to be very very

00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:51,460
careful that you know what you're doing

00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,170
when you set up these preferences

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,290
sometimes political decisions are not

00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:01,040
the same as technical decisions so once

00:26:57,290 --> 00:27:02,900
it's established what to do and create a

00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:05,270
means of determining what's the best

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,960
path to get the traffic from here to

00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,540
there we set that into a table and send

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,460
it out to our neighbors and in the

00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,740
process of doing all this by applying

00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,230
the policies by looking at what's the

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,360
shortest path what's the best path you

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:23,180
now have a way to get the traffic across

00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:26,570
the Internet in the most efficient way

00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:29,840
questions at this point one had exploded

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:38,210
sorry can you take him out yep call 911

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:42,460
thank you well we have a question I'm

00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:42,460
not sure I understand that question

00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,260
could you use an access list

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,940
router to block that you could but they

00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,520
wanted to make it I guess it's a bit

00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,990
that at the larger scale that says I'm

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,270
going to take any traffic that's coming

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,940
in with a YouTube address or addresses

00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:05,950
and I'm going to black hole those things

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,830
and just drop those discard those

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,320
packets or send them to my redirected

00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,299
router that says you are evil you

00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:16,000
shouldn't be talking to you tube you're

00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:26,410
not going to get there from here another

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:28,240
question would be nice we've got someone

00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:31,480
who's volunteering to log into his home

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,940
is P and look at a dual home system it's

00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,730
his own business because this guy runs a

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:41,440
wireless isp and he's got a lot of

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:52,480
experience in this Zach okay any other

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:55,049
questions at this stage yes yes my

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,160
definition bgp puts the time to live

00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:59,590
remember from our prior session on

00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:01,360
routing principles the time to live at

00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:06,970
one it's going to make one hop and

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:09,520
one-hop only there is multi hot bgp

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,850
which is beyond the scope of this

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:15,160
discussion we could get deep into it and

00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:18,429
we won't make it if we if we go too deep

00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:24,549
was there another question questions are

00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:26,770
good okay moving on so bgp tables inside

00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:29,140
a router this is a typical router every

00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:30,880
router has a garbage can in it sometimes

00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,740
that's called a black hole sometimes as

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:35,290
called i don't care i'm get rid of you

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:37,450
but we take n things from our peer the

00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:40,480
blue box on the left and we look at that

00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:42,730
information and we apply a process of

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,679
looking at our policies inside and our

00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:47,530
preferences and those routes that are

00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:50,290
accepted go into my internal bgp table

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,720
and those things eventually go over to

00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:55,210
the right to my routing table that the

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,390
router that this is residing and

00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:00,250
actually uses to pass information in and

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,710
out now for tea table is just a

00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,659
condensation of i don't care how you got

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,759
there I've just got to look up list

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:09,159
tells me what I'm gonna do what I see

00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:11,229
these individual routes or wanna see

00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:13,869
these addresses and I'm gonna put that

00:30:11,229 --> 00:30:15,909
into a nice simple table that can be

00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:18,519
used by any of the cards in this big boy

00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:20,799
router and by the way routers today have

00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,229
multiple cards inside there so they're

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,159
just handling lots and lots the routers

00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:29,259
that I work with and have 400 gigabit

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:33,279
interfaces on there that's 40 10 gig

00:30:29,259 --> 00:30:34,809
interfaces per card so you get about 10

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,249
of those across there you can see that

00:30:34,809 --> 00:30:38,229
you got a lot of interconnections that

00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,269
you can make but you can also do it at a

00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:42,639
hundred gig and mix-and-match as needed

00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:44,259
the point is that each of those cards

00:30:42,639 --> 00:30:46,509
needs to have a forwarding table that

00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:48,489
says what I do this route that's coming

00:30:46,509 --> 00:30:50,649
in where do I send it do I send it back

00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:52,599
out on this car doing send it across a

00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:54,759
switching fabric and send it to another

00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:57,999
card that's what that forwarding table

00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:59,769
does but in the BGP process we don't go

00:30:57,999 --> 00:31:02,499
to that stage we go back to our blue box

00:30:59,769 --> 00:31:04,389
it's the BGP table and we do a process

00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:06,700
it decides what's important to send to

00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:09,279
the neighbors and that's what we send

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,679
back out to them so it's a continuous

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,809
process of evaluating these routes and

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,590
every time something new comes into this

00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:19,929
table it will be advertised out as

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,179
needed now this is just one pier we're

00:31:19,929 --> 00:31:24,429
looking at one pier and its neighbor

00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:26,830
this goes on in a router where there's

00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:28,450
usually multiple peers doesn't have to

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,179
be but you also have to take into

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:33,460
account every one of these so we must

00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:36,039
establish for each of these adjacent

00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,909
peers a complete set of routing

00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,649
information and that routing information

00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:43,450
helps decide what we send to each of

00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:45,519
these individual peers because they'll

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,649
be different some peers may know things

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,599
and you're getting that from them the

00:31:47,649 --> 00:31:51,789
other guys that you peer with don't know

00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,710
those but you don't send back to the guy

00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:59,049
that sent you those things the same

00:31:53,710 --> 00:32:02,559
information confused yet you will be ok

00:31:59,049 --> 00:32:06,029
so for successful neighbor peering we've

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,950
got to exchange information and

00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:10,479
negotiate that start up the handshake so

00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:12,909
the things that you got to look for are

00:32:10,479 --> 00:32:14,470
what is the version number that we're

00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:16,330
going to use it in BGP if they're not

00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:17,940
the same then the two routers can't talk

00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,889
not starter

00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,899
identify yourself with an s number

00:32:19,889 --> 00:32:24,629
that's been assigned to you and that's

00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:27,679
the identifying a s number that will get

00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:30,179
used as you put hops across the network

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,340
there's a whole time here the whole time

00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:33,720
is needed so that you if you lose

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,399
connections with your peer and

00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,500
something's not going on either because

00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:40,500
they died because somebody sliced the

00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:42,299
fiber between you two or whatever it

00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,009
will know that it's time for me to give

00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:45,299
up and start trying to establish a

00:32:44,009 --> 00:32:47,190
connection again or do something

00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:48,840
different I'm just not anymore

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:51,840
communicating and we need to do

00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:53,940
something to get that back up the BGP

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,529
router ID is the address that you're

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,759
going to send things to to your neighbor

00:32:55,529 --> 00:32:59,909
and that's usually a loopback address

00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,950
inside that router and then there's a

00:32:59,909 --> 00:33:03,929
lot of optional parameters such as time

00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,240
and lengthen value that can be exchanged

00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:08,700
back and forth in point the important

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,950
point is that once you've got your vgp

00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,899
handshake up and running you start

00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:16,019
exchanging these messages and the

00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,029
messages look like these five types open

00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:20,309
which we use to start off the BGC

00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,450
process where we're exchanging the

00:33:20,309 --> 00:33:23,639
parameters that we're going to try to

00:33:21,450 --> 00:33:25,620
agree on to talk and successfully

00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:27,360
negotiate those and once I've got that

00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:29,940
done we don't need to go back to open

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,889
unless something goes wrong update is

00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:34,019
one of the main things you'll be doing

00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:37,710
update says I'm going to transfer

00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:38,850
information from what I know to you so

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,399
you could use it in your routing

00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,350
decisions in that thing that used inside

00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:45,809
these is called network layer reach

00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,789
ability information that's a fancy long

00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:51,059
run out word it comes from the standards

00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:53,789
body that means address prefix but it

00:33:51,059 --> 00:33:56,070
does comply error does imply that there

00:33:53,789 --> 00:33:58,529
is something that is looking to see can

00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:00,210
I really reach that address if I need to

00:33:58,529 --> 00:34:02,850
is it a valid address and that's part of

00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:04,740
what the BGP protocols is is doing is to

00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:06,389
make sure that those things are looked

00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,270
at and we don't advertise something

00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:11,849
that's really not reachable notification

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:14,339
is bad that says something has gone

00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:16,319
wrong there's an error somewhere you get

00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:18,210
to go back to that little Idol penalty

00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:21,240
box and start your little state machine

00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:22,950
all over again not nice but it happens

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,560
in it needs to be a part of the protocol

00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:28,020
keep-alive says I got no information for

00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,869
you dude but just so you know I'm still

00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:31,859
here hottie duty and other protocols

00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:34,769
that's called a hello

00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:36,929
so the keepalive is just maintaining the

00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:39,869
session if you lose three successive

00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:42,450
keep lives typically the bgp protocol

00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:45,210
says and heard from him he's a wall

00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:47,039
we're going down and they'll take down

00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:50,460
the entire bgp connection now what

00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,259
happens when that goes goes on is you

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,960
gotta decide am I going to say I can no

00:34:52,259 --> 00:34:57,390
longer reach these guys over here and

00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,640
that's part of the network layer reach

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:01,890
ability information that goes out and

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,710
then the fifth message here is a route

00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:06,779
refresh hey can you can you give me some

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:09,420
information I I think something's gone

00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:11,640
on or I need to I've had some changes I

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:14,369
think you may have some changes and you

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,489
give me what you know again and that

00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:20,279
that is makes up the main five messages

00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:22,049
that go on now these messages can be any

00:35:20,279 --> 00:35:24,329
length from nineteen bytes to four

00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:25,680
thousand bytes in length and it depends

00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:28,109
on how much information is coming

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,230
through there that update message could

00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:34,049
have a list of several a esas and within

00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,029
the a esas several prefixes and then

00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:38,039
another a s and other prefix of a lot of

00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:40,470
information that's kind of arranged in

00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:42,809
an order so that the router can run its

00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:47,069
routing algorithm on it and put those

00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:49,920
into is routing information based so we

00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:51,869
now got our star bgp session established

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,940
we're up we're running now we get into

00:35:51,869 --> 00:35:57,089
the process of learning the routes and

00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:59,039
that network layer reach ability is the

00:35:57,089 --> 00:36:00,869
important part to pass back and forth

00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:03,660
and those are conveyed back and forth

00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:06,989
with update messages they go into a

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:10,380
localized routing information that's

00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:12,450
called local rib in and that local is

00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:13,859
just local to the router it doesn't say

00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:16,319
I'm trying to look at the whole internet

00:36:13,859 --> 00:36:17,940
I'm trying to see what I know based on

00:36:16,319 --> 00:36:20,130
information I'm getting because that

00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,400
same router may not be running BGP only

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,349
he may be running ospf he may have local

00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,299
thing is coming from underlings beneath

00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:29,549
him that he knows about because they've

00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:31,829
been advertised to him and he's got that

00:36:29,549 --> 00:36:34,819
information that he uses to establish

00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:39,480
what he's gonna put into his neighbor's

00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:41,099
routing database adjacency rib adjacency

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,249
writing information basis what he

00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:45,570
maintains for each and every neighbor so

00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:46,740
you got an end for things

00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,080
come in to you that you use for

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:50,970
consideration or run your process on and

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:53,550
you got it out that you'll use to send

00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:57,110
out to your neighbor all the decision

00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:00,030
factors look at what's the best path

00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:02,220
that I would use to advertise out and

00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:05,310
once he's completed that he'll then send

00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:08,670
it out to his neighbors so in an update

00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:10,290
message you may have a need to say hey

00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,970
these are routes that you had in your

00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,860
table and I told you they were good but

00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,200
they've gone away or somebody's

00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,850
withdrawn them or we've decided to do

00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:19,830
something different but take these out

00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,780
of your list if you don't mind and an

00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:23,970
update message can be only withdrawn

00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,800
routes doesn't have to have new routes

00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:28,200
any information that you need to come in

00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:30,300
there but the the other important thing

00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:33,540
that'll always be in an update message

00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:36,270
is the path it's an attribute that will

00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,460
give you the prefix in there and that

00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:39,710
all the messages have to have this in

00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,840
there and when you're talking about

00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:45,330
what's the next hop how do I get to this

00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:48,510
next IP address and then this network

00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:51,870
reach ability information actually has

00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:53,730
prefixes that are announced they they

00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:56,040
can have multiple of these things that

00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:58,080
out and the neighbors can choose to

00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:00,600
resend these things with new or updated

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,820
path attributes so each router is

00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,890
independently reconstructing his table

00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:07,140
of information to make the best choice

00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:11,400
of what to send out and keep the network

00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:13,380
running the internet running so once

00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,660
you've started we're beginning to get

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,790
deeper and deeper we're down to sub

00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,740
layer three at this point 10 different

00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:23,160
attributes which are mandatory for any

00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:24,720
bgp protocol to be using some of them

00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,430
are optional the three the most well

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,890
known that you're coming in here is the

00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:32,730
origin attribute where did you learn

00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:35,520
about this l l and l RI are this prefix

00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,770
and this is where the router make some

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,750
decisions and bgp says you know i may

00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:41,400
have a preference and usually do that i

00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:44,160
got this from a look God that I'm

00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:46,830
connected to I know what he's doing so

00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,650
this may have a higher weight and often

00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:52,020
does in making routing decisions than

00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,840
something that came from an AS three

00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,650
hops away so you would probably give

00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:59,430
that one preference so local and

00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:02,130
internal

00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:05,040
routing protocol igp is better than an

00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:07,170
external routing protocol and then you

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,319
need the a s path where did you come

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:14,069
from dude and this may be a hop by hop

00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:16,589
count of a esas of how it got there and

00:39:14,069 --> 00:39:19,440
all these AS IS from which it comes must

00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:22,260
be listed are there and this number of a

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,690
esas establishes the hop count so you

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:26,910
know that I can get to this network if

00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,980
somebody sends a packet to them it'll be

00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:31,470
X number of hops away if a different

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:33,900
neighbor has a lower number of hops you

00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,819
may choose to advertise out I can get to

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,369
this network but take it out this path

00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:41,309
and that's the one that you would want

00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:43,829
to use so it's also used as a means of

00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:46,349
detecting loops because loops in a

00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:48,180
routing world are evil and will shut you

00:39:46,349 --> 00:39:50,190
down because you don't want a lot of

00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:51,900
packets continuously looping around and

00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:55,050
consuming your bandwidth with the same

00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:57,059
information until a time to live die so

00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:59,910
Luke detection and the internet is is a

00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:01,950
very important part and finally the most

00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:03,450
important information is or the heck am

00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,910
I going to send this packet and that's

00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:09,839
the next hop and that's the IP address

00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:12,500
of the adjacent or the neighbor bgp that

00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,049
you're talking to so far so good

00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:18,200
confused yet you will be here's the

00:40:16,049 --> 00:40:21,660
decision factors that go into making

00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:23,700
whether I choose to pick a best path

00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,670
first one is a local preference within

00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:28,410
the a s local meaning I know this guy

00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:29,790
cuz I'm connected to him so I'm really

00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,500
sure that I know where he's coming from

00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:35,220
I'm going to choose that as my most

00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,500
important best path to use routes that

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:39,920
are originated in that local router are

00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:42,480
often considered the very very best

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,650
second thing is I want to look at her

00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,809
the third thing I want to look at the

00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:47,640
shortest path the lowest number of hops

00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:52,710
through autonomous systems to get there

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:54,480
or a lowest origin code meaning a code

00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,150
Anna metric gets in there that says

00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,650
local stuff is better than external

00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:05,250
stuff there's another one when you have

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:08,339
two or more routes to a particular a.s.a

00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:10,530
multi exit discriminator meaning i could

00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:12,059
exit these packets this way this way

00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:13,170
because they're both going to the same a

00:41:12,059 --> 00:41:15,119
s

00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,339
both going to the internet but you you

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,770
assign a waiting to one or the other to

00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:21,359
steer the packets over one and you can

00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:22,799
make that connection and some of the

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:25,890
provisioning that you do of those

00:41:22,799 --> 00:41:28,170
particular routes another one is to

00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:30,630
prefer external paths to internal paths

00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:32,730
maybe I don't want to route something

00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,400
going to Google back down into my

00:41:32,730 --> 00:41:37,049
subservient ISPs and hope that he's got

00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,930
a way to get it back over to Google you

00:41:37,049 --> 00:41:43,530
don't do that you're out up not now and

00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:45,780
then uh let's see select the oldest

00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:47,099
route to minimize a route flapping

00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,290
meaning if it's been there while is

00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:51,720
probably pretty solid Ralph lamping is a

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:55,049
bad thing you start Ralph lamping you

00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,109
may wind up having to take it down to

00:41:55,049 --> 00:42:00,240
start back up again so if you if you're

00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:02,430
still not if you're still tied on a

00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,339
choice of the best path you may choose a

00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:07,440
router ID value or lowest neighbor

00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:09,420
address little things like that to make

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,390
it happen but in the end you have made a

00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,650
choice and this list of decision factors

00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:18,359
is how a particular ISP can choose to

00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:21,510
discriminate one over another to steer

00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,730
traffic one way over another way and in

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:26,309
some countries where the authorities the

00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,930
telecom authorities decide to steer

00:42:26,309 --> 00:42:30,359
traffic in a way that winds up

00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,740
disrupting the internet which is what we

00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:34,130
talked about in Pakistan we have a

00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,130
question

00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:46,970
yes some cases there tiebreakers

00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,770
steering factors but yeah they do but

00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:54,580
the question was are these used to break

00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:54,580
a tie in in these things question

00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:03,110
absolutely the question is can be GP

00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,300
redistribute static from the way ospf

00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:07,490
can and yes you can plug static routes

00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,350
and you often will bugs down its routes

00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:11,240
that's that's part of your preference of

00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:13,940
I know what's best to get the traffic

00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,350
implant-- point A to point B I know how

00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:17,840
to best to get that you can put those

00:43:15,350 --> 00:43:21,280
static routes in there as part of BGP

00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:26,330
yes let us see another question no more

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:29,990
okay all right moving on so once you're

00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:35,090
in side an autonomous system we don't

00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:37,190
use ebgp we use ibgp ibgp is an internal

00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:39,290
form of EGP and some of the rules and

00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:40,580
regulations a little bit different but

00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:42,800
because you've got some different

00:43:40,580 --> 00:43:45,890
problems you you may have to worry about

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:51,110
it now if we went back up this is going

00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:53,810
to freak people out where are we let's

00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:57,440
go to this one right here if we look at

00:43:53,810 --> 00:44:00,860
this this peering of ISPs this this

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:04,570
yellow one in the middle is got two

00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:07,760
connections up to two different ISPs and

00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:09,830
internally he's got to do something

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,770
different than what he would do to these

00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:14,270
other connections internally I bgb

00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,890
requires that you have a fully mesh

00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:18,080
network meaning each of these routers

00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:20,180
must be connected to each other and you

00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,800
don't see all the connections here but

00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,810
each router must be connected to the

00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,830
other router so that one or outcomes in

00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:31,340
from gold or from green as400 a s500 I

00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:33,770
know what to do with that route and I

00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:36,950
give it to each of the routers inside my

00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:39,050
autonomous system who's running ibgp at

00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:40,820
the same time that way we're not

00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:43,040
propagating the same thing over and over

00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,260
and over each adding its own thing we

00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:47,600
must be connected now there's a little

00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,840
problem with that and the problem is

00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,989
called an N squared problem we can get

00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:56,690
to it

00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:58,309
the N squared problem says that if I'm

00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,759
going to make a connection between two

00:44:58,309 --> 00:45:03,049
routers I need only one connection but

00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:06,019
I'm going to make a connection between

00:45:03,049 --> 00:45:08,119
five routers and have them all talk to

00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:09,739
each other router I've got to have five

00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:12,680
routers talking to for other places

00:45:09,739 --> 00:45:14,959
that's 10 links total then links means

00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:16,880
that I've got two interfaces on each end

00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:18,799
so if I'm buying expensive interfaces

00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,359
and these are running hundred gigabits

00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,969
and the costing thousands of dollars

00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:24,890
I've got to put a whole lot of expensive

00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:26,630
stuff in there and not only do have a

00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,339
lot of expensive stuff I've got to have

00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,410
a fiber connection between these things

00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:32,089
which means I've got to run a lot of

00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:34,130
fiber into the ground so it's very

00:45:32,089 --> 00:45:36,410
difficult when you increase it from five

00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:38,719
routers to 10 runners you go to 45 links

00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:41,359
when you double it to 20 routers you go

00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:42,920
to 190 links so you can see this you got

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:44,599
a fairly large sized network and there

00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,859
are networks that have routers of that

00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:51,019
size you can't afford to have everything

00:45:48,859 --> 00:45:53,329
totally meshed and connect to each other

00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:56,329
so what we do in this case is do

00:45:53,329 --> 00:45:58,009
something called a route reflector and a

00:45:56,329 --> 00:46:00,769
route reflector will take those routes

00:45:58,009 --> 00:46:02,839
and send it to these guys so they don't

00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:05,269
have to be connected and those those

00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:07,190
border gateway routers then advertise to

00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:10,549
the rest of the people what that rotting

00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:13,369
that math is eliminated for I need for a

00:46:10,549 --> 00:46:15,469
lot of those interconnections there's an

00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:16,999
RFC that defines all this this is going

00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:19,069
to be beyond the scope of what we've got

00:46:16,999 --> 00:46:21,650
at the time that we've got here and

00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:24,349
another solution that you may need in 22

00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:27,049
here is we use Confederations where we

00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:29,959
divide an AS into smaller a SS and

00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:32,299
subnet these or sub divide these a SS so

00:46:29,959 --> 00:46:34,759
that we have a better way of handling

00:46:32,299 --> 00:46:36,650
things and eliminate the need for all

00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:38,209
the mass connections so essentially

00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:40,130
you're nominating a grouping of routers

00:46:38,209 --> 00:46:41,900
and there's a king at the top and he's

00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:44,900
telling all his subjects worried what

00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,940
they need to know and the router at the

00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:48,890
very top the border gateway router then

00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:52,219
tells these Kings how to pass that

00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:54,469
information on so we've now gone through

00:46:52,219 --> 00:46:56,209
a lot of information I'll pause at this

00:46:54,469 --> 00:47:00,210
point and ask are there any other

00:46:56,209 --> 00:47:02,530
questions before I move on to the ending

00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:05,140
no questions you know what that means

00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:08,470
that means that now you know you know

00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:13,210
when bgp is used you know who requires

00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:15,730
bgp you know how it communicates you

00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:18,460
know what it communicates you know we're

00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:19,900
trying in the internet and you know that

00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,570
you better not try this at home because

00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:25,360
it ain't gotta work and that is vgp de

00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:32,940
beste fide ah we have one more question

00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:35,290
yes sir 38 I don't know what bgp 38 is

00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:38,230
see now you've gone deeper than we were

00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:41,590
able to go here in an hour's time so bgp

00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:56,130
30 or 38 I'm not sure Zach did you want

00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:56,130
to do something thank you very much

00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:59,230
alright so this is my isp's bgp router

00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:01,510
and i'm just going to do a show IP bgp

00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:04,810
and it does take a while to run this

00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:07,720
command it is showing you the it is

00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:10,870
processing the full internet table we

00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,360
had we have to upstream isp connections

00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:17,620
each of them give us a full table and

00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:26,770
that full table is that 50 about a half

00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:28,180
a million route to each um kinda I'm

00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:31,750
ubiquity actually makes it very

00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:37,330
affordable router it costs us less than

00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:43,180
five min a bucks for this router and and

00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:46,450
it is capable of doing to peers so when

00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:49,270
he was going back about showing the path

00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:51,570
so as you see most of these networks

00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:55,240
let's just focus on this one right here

00:49:51,570 --> 00:49:58,000
this particular subnet so if you try to

00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,260
go to the IP address one dot one dot one

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:03,820
dot one it is going to pick this route

00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,980
bgp like all routing uses the most

00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:09,310
specific route and this happens to be

00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:12,100
the / 24 which is the minimum size that

00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:16,240
you can advertise in BGP to help keep

00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:21,850
Ralph small so as you can see for this

00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:24,910
particular route the let's see this this

00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:29,800
host or this link will be the best one

00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:34,540
because it is only it is only to a SS

00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:37,720
away we don't do any any of the prefix

00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:43,440
from any of the local / if any of those

00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:47,660
type so we just rely on the AAS ha as or

00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:51,390
metric that we use and how we actually

00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:54,540
it's difficult to influence incoming

00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:57,510
traffic basically download traffic for

00:50:54,540 --> 00:51:00,480
the client so what we actually use is we

00:50:57,510 --> 00:51:04,950
advertise specific / twenty-fours two

00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:07,940
different ISPs and then aggregate then

00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:11,070
advertise the aggregate to the other isp

00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:14,250
for the failover capability so if these

00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:18,000
more specific route on the primary isp

00:51:14,250 --> 00:51:20,280
goes down it falls over to the more

00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:27,050
aggregated less specific route and that

00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:27,050
gives us the availability and let's see

00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,619
so

00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:36,430
is actually going to show the routes

00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:40,930
that are actually selected and again it

00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:45,009
takes a while to process so this is

00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:47,410
actually showing which of the two it

00:51:45,009 --> 00:51:50,469
which interfaces going out which hosts

00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:59,289
it's going to and also when it was last

00:51:50,469 --> 00:52:02,819
updated no it's it takes a little bit of

00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:05,769
the CPU hit to do it the question was

00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:10,539
when when we run this does our customers

00:52:05,769 --> 00:52:17,410
see it no it it moves a it's more of a

00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:22,059
CQ hit a all right so right there is the

00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:24,579
uptime so that could be it could happen

00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:27,999
from that obtained could change because

00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:30,640
the route get changed because someone

00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:33,160
would drew it or we added it or if the

00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:38,410
link goes down like the bgp pier goes

00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:39,759
down this will get reset back and then

00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:41,319
right there's just the physical

00:52:39,759 --> 00:52:43,299
interface on the router that it's going

00:52:41,319 --> 00:52:47,229
out there is the pier that it's going

00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:53,849
out and of course there is the the

00:52:47,229 --> 00:52:53,849
prefix that is using that's it

00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:18,609
yes that is correct um honestly not that

00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:22,210
many the I think about four or five has

00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:27,310
been the max we we connect us okay

00:53:22,210 --> 00:53:30,339
actually the 1070 network right here is

00:53:27,310 --> 00:53:32,349
probably but about the most that you're

00:53:30,339 --> 00:53:37,410
actually going to see that at least I'm

00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:40,359
on our network the typically is

00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:41,680
typically the IP addresses are a lot

00:53:40,359 --> 00:53:44,500
closer so they don't have to go through

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,060
that many hops where we one of our

00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:53,829
upstream peers is actually very well

00:53:46,060 --> 00:54:11,800
connected yep exactly and I can actually

00:53:53,829 --> 00:54:14,230
do a show bgp pier so that that that

00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:18,700
shows our two bgp peers let me move it

00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:23,290
up on the screen so you can see how many

00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:26,680
messages have been received what's the

00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:29,050
status of the links we had a installer

00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:35,040
firmware 11 weeks ago so that's why the

00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:38,680
reboot so right here this is the

00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,480
interface or this is the bgp pier

00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:44,470
address that we actually appear with

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:47,440
with our upstream providers here is the

00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:48,970
a s number that we connect to that one

00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:56,640
right there's earthlink and that is

00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:59,619
spirit earthlink is incredibly cheap so

00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:01,690
so that this right here again this is

00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:05,069
the IP address that we connect to this

00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:07,390
is the a s number this one right here is

00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:09,220
earthlink they're incredibly cheap

00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:12,570
that's where we put our residential

00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,730
users and here are the

00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:17,630
she's received back back to what he was

00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:23,190
talking about about the updates and then

00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:27,330
here is how many preferences are getting

00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:34,700
from each one and of course the router

00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:48,410
is rebooted 11 weeks ago questions

00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:52,740
you're welcome um I would show you the I

00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:55,200
can't sanitize the config file so the

00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,630
question is is the static are the routes

00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,100
setup statically and I would show you

00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:01,890
all my config file but I can't sanitize

00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:04,380
it and it will show the ospf ospf

00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:07,800
password that we use on our network so

00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:10,800
I'm not going to do that but we do

00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,380
statically set our announcements we

00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:17,580
don't have any downstream bgp peers we

00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:20,460
only peer up so all of our announcements

00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:24,500
that we send up are statically assigned

00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,500
and rarely change a

00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:41,630
it direction the question is is is there

00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:44,180
a route to our upstream know there's a

00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:46,490
fiber that runs from our router down the

00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:48,890
building and into their switch and it's

00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:51,320
just a little layer to layer three

00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:59,900
connection very simple there's an

00:56:51,320 --> 00:57:03,010
incredibly good website this is I use

00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:05,570
I'm in this website almost every day

00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:08,060
first off it will show you who is the

00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:12,230
owner of every IP address just behind

00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:16,490
the ASM here is our lovely a s number I

00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:22,100
know this one by heart one 1672 i go

00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:24,800
here a lot and so here is here is a

00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:27,800
little bit of a graph of how we are

00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:30,170
connected to the global Internet as seen

00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,580
by hurricane electric I'm hurricane

00:57:30,170 --> 00:57:34,100
electric is one of the backbone

00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:37,360
providers what a big backbone from

00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:40,670
providers and then you can also see

00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:44,180
which I which IP addresses we advertise

00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:46,670
which subnets and so forth in even on

00:57:44,180 --> 00:57:50,540
this page you can see some summary like

00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:53,000
we're advertising 24,000 addresses and

00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:55,730
then lower on the screen you can see

00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,110
basically our prefix changes over time

00:57:55,730 --> 00:58:03,170
our peer count changes for the past 90

00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:05,870
days and so you can basically put in any

00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:07,700
domain name any IP address or any AES

00:58:05,870 --> 00:58:09,680
number and basically find out the

00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,780
history of this net of that network for

00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:20,450
the past 90 days using this tool and

00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:23,180
it's just is BG phe net and it's so n

00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:26,030
bgp world there's a concept called

00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:28,790
looking glass which is basically a

00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:30,440
looking glass server is a publicly

00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:34,970
accessible server that someone can

00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:36,560
connect to to show just to wait with and

00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:41,060
someone's network basically show the

00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:42,620
routes as seen by that isp hurricane

00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:45,530
electric took it to a new standard and

00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:47,540
actually made it a usable display of

00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,560
information then looking glass looking

00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:54,280
gas can be

00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:54,280
very complicated to look at that's it

00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,640
you

00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,560
you

01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,510
you

01:00:24,339 --> 01:00:26,400
you

01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,260
you

01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:12,690
your customers rely on your website or

01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:15,059
application if it's slower

01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:17,999
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:19,859
and costs you money keeping your

01:01:17,999 --> 01:01:23,450
business critical systems humming along

01:01:19,859 --> 01:01:25,760
requires insight into what they're doing

01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:27,710
your system metrics tells stories

01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,720
stories that can reveal performance

01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:32,030
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:33,620
other problems but how do you keep an

01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:36,260
eye on all of your systems performance

01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:39,290
metrics in real-time and record this

01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:41,030
data for later analysis enter longview

01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:43,070
the new way to see what's really going

01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:45,260
on under the hood the long view

01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:47,330
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,850
of all your systems providing you with a

01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:53,270
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:55,820
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:01:53,270 --> 01:01:57,530
load and network usage click a specific

01:01:55,820 --> 01:01:59,810
system to access its individual

01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:02,350
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:01:59,810 --> 01:02:04,730
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:06,410
comprehensive network data including

01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:08,720
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:10,700
available on the network tab and disk

01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,860
rights and free space on a disk stabbed

01:02:10,700 --> 01:02:15,020
while the process explorer displays

01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:17,510
usage statistics for individual

01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,700
processes the system info tab shows

01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:21,920
listening services active connections

01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:24,050
and available updates adding long view

01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,760
to a system is easy just click the

01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,920
button copy the one line installation

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,350
command then run the command on your

01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:32,060
linux system to complete the process the

01:02:30,350 --> 01:02:34,280
agent will begin collecting data and

01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:36,160
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,740
start rolling

01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,140
use longview to gain visibility into

01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:44,940
your servers so when your website or app

01:02:41,140 --> 01:02:44,940
heats up it stays up

01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:12,560
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

01:05:10,580 --> 01:05:15,470
you need to integrate manage and

01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:17,600
automate a virtual data center all on an

01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:20,000
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:22,730
platform and at a third of the cost of

01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:24,470
other solutions but why even bother with

01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:26,630
virtualizing your server infrastructure

01:05:24,470 --> 01:05:28,580
in the first place well let's say you

01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:30,890
have a traditional one server to one

01:05:28,580 --> 01:05:32,900
application architecture but you're

01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:35,420
running out of resources and performance

01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:37,750
is suffering once you order new server

01:05:35,420 --> 01:05:40,640
hardware you'll wait for delivery

01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:43,550
configure it install your business

01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:46,310
application stage and test the server

01:05:43,550 --> 01:05:48,500
and finally add it to your production

01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:50,690
farm if you've been through this process

01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:53,210
before you know it can take weeks or

01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:55,070
even months you also know it's a

01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:56,990
manually intensive process that will

01:05:55,070 --> 01:06:00,320
burden your team every time you outgrow

01:05:56,990 --> 01:06:02,090
your current setup with a virtual server

01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:04,880
solution you could accomplish all of

01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:07,460
that in less than half a day server

01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,290
virtualization software separates the OS

01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:11,690
and application from the underlying

01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:13,850
server hardware and with multiple

01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,590
virtual machines on a single server you

01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:18,530
can use each of them to run different

01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:20,300
os's and applications this makes it

01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:22,100
possible to move your virtual machines

01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:22,950
from one piece of hardware to another

01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:25,800
whenever

01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:27,690
want to maximize utilization simplify

01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,030
maintenance or recover from a hardware

01:06:27,690 --> 01:06:33,119
failure and without slowing down your

01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:35,780
applications or users clearly server

01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:38,599
virtualization provides big benefits and

01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:41,000
