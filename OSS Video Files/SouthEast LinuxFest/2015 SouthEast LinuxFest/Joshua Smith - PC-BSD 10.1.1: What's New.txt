your lives hi there I see a lot of faces

00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,960
out there I appreciate you guys coming

00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:27,590
to my talk today my name is Joshua Smith

00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,890
and I work on the pc-bsd project also

00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:33,559
private systems our quality assurance so

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,870
I it's basically a glorified title for

00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,540
me do a lot of different things on the

00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:41,469
project but mainly I leave the heavy

00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:45,050
lifting to the of a two-day developers

00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:47,390
this talk is going to be on pc-bsd it's

00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:49,640
kind of an introductory primer on pc-bsd

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:54,200
and it's also going to have about 10 to

00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,930
15 minutes of seasoning to the 15

00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,660
minutes of new features that we have

00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:04,489
added the PCBs to you just in the last

00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:07,279
couple of months all right so before we

00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:09,590
talk about what pc-bsd is it's important

00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:12,079
to know what pc-bsd is a belt on which

00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,389
is scream VSD there's a lot of good

00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:17,179
things about cream bsd it's a unix-like

00:01:14,389 --> 00:01:19,880
operating systems is descended from ATT

00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:24,590
units it's known for its legendary

00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,939
stability and security we utilize the

00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,310
port system which will allow you to

00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:31,549
basically both your software for your

00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:34,459
system from source it's a unified

00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:36,649
development model which basically means

00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:38,389
it is a complete encapsulated operating

00:01:36,649 --> 00:01:42,079
system in and of itself it is not

00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:44,599
piecemeal together we have excellent

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,810
documentation even if you're who user

00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:49,399
you can feel very comfortable basically

00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,950
getting in our documentation and not

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:53,989
feeling completely overwhelmed from the

00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,789
start in other words it'll basically

00:01:53,989 --> 00:02:00,889
start from a really good point if you've

00:01:55,789 --> 00:02:02,479
never used a VSD for PC PST now there

00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:04,700
are a couple of hang-ups with Ruby st

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,069
for a guy like me I come from a

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,780
background where I was I don't want to

00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:09,950
say this too loudly but a Windows system

00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:13,069
and then

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:15,410
and when you go from something like that

00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:17,870
into an operating system that is

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:19,250
basically very command-line driven it

00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,760
can be there can be a little bit of

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,440
learning curve there just to give you an

00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,660
example just to configure something like

00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,519
my wireless and considering myself an

00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,569
advanced user it took me the better part

00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:34,220
45 minutes which I felt very silly

00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,620
afterwards is it didn't seem that hard

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:40,280
but just not be going with it to me

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,470
while it's also historically been

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,510
lacking some of the more PC oriented

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:47,269
device drivers now the good news about

00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:49,519
that is recently we've gotten a lot

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:52,459
better in the past we haven't had great

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,489
support for AMD graphics cards or ATM

00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:57,530
with whatever you want to call them and

00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,720
we've actually added support built

00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,670
directly into the freebsd kernel for

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,829
those graphics cards we've also just

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,010
recently very very recently in the last

00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:09,980
couple of weeks at a support for has won

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,670
Rodwell still very very new but it is

00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:23,480
available opening pc-bsd and 11 crime

00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:25,790
image so freebsd m pc-bsd used a

00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,530
simplified bsd license I just want to

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:29,540
briefly talk about this in a couple of

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,170
differences just so you guys get an idea

00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:37,910
of what what the differences are maybe

00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:39,829
between PSD and a Linux basically it's

00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,730
very short it's an easy to understand

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:45,410
license it weighs then it just 193 words

00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,989
so very very simple read and understand

00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:50,480
is what we like to consider a permissive

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:53,090
license so if you do want to take that

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,069
and commercialize it later for a project

00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,220
or something like that that is that is

00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:00,139
allowed it also protects the developers

00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:05,239
from liability with resulting from use

00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:07,549
of the original software and this is

00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,859
just kind of an example of a BSD license

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:12,079
just to give you an idea there's just a

00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:15,019
couple of a couple of clauses here few

00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:18,099
paragraphs but nice and easy to

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,099
understand and read

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:24,260
so now I'm going to talk a little bit

00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,389
about the difference that I see in the

00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,490
GPL three license now this I want to

00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:30,440
make a streaming this clear this is not

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:32,930
saying one is better than the other by

00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,280
any means whatsoever just to kind of

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,889
illustrate they do serve different

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,750
purposes it is a little bit longer it

00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,580
can be a little bit more complex to

00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,590
understand especially maybe if that

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,510
person isn't from a technical background

00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,620
if it's a business manager that's just

00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:48,470
wanting to know if they can use the

00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:50,530
software permissibly further use it can

00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,910
be a little more complex to understand

00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:55,310
it offers a lot of protection they keep

00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:56,810
a product open source which obviously in

00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:00,770
a lot of cases it is definitely not a

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,450
shop in some instances of you know we

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,830
have heard businesses that say it can be

00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,050
a little difficult to commercialize not

00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,310
that it can't be just that there can be

00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,410
a little bit of difficulty there it's

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:16,039
just not quite as permissive I guess

00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:17,389
since it is a copyleft license so now

00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:18,860
that we've talked about my freebsd a

00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:22,250
little bit let's go ahead and get in

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:25,370
what pc-bsd is well basically quite

00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,660
simply its previous be simplified what

00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:29,380
we do is we give you a pre-configured

00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,190
desktop and server installations they're

00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,470
just ready to go right from the

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,180
Installer we are desktop environment

00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,590
independent so you can count on if you

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,680
want to choose your favorite desktop

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,180
environment if it's in linux usually we

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,760
have a port for it and previous diaz

00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:45,139
fourth desktop environment scope you

00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,539
know all kinds of different ones and we

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,130
can talk about more of those later we

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:52,130
also have a lot of additions that are

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,320
added on on top of previous team we have

00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:55,940
the graphical installer that will just

00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,760
make it nice and easy lead you through

00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,860
the entire setup process we have the

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,919
word for jail management which basically

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:06,830
just manages isolated versions of

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,200
freebsd it's a type of virtualization

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,490
and you can just have a bunch of these

00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,860
different jails running if you want to

00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,060
run say like a Webster or something you

00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,820
could totally run that from inside of

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,940
jail but again we'll talk about that a

00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,440
little more in depth we have appt cafe

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,570
for our push button in solar

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,039
applications it manages all the

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:27,750
different kinds of applications with

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:30,480
packages and push button installers

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:32,760
we have a whole bunch of other graphical

00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,980
utilities that we do now I won't enforce

00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:37,590
one be able to in all of them but I will

00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:39,540
have a live demo set up at my booth out

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:42,210
there you guys want to have a look I can

00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:44,190
show you all the all the ones and also

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,710
we offer full disk jelly encryption if

00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:48,060
you want to lock down here your hard

00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:49,860
drive basically right there from this

00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:54,690
dollar you can actually kill disk

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:56,250
encryption or an installer so i'm going

00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,440
to show you guys just a few slides and

00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,670
then we're going to move on into some

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,680
showing you guys like the utilities that

00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,780
we offer and uh something about that

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,810
we've been doing but to start with i'm

00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,400
going to show you guys this is our up to

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:11,010
bootloader that we're using we actually

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,910
brought that in because it helps us work

00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:17,130
with departments and also speak on that

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,830
in more detail but it helps us to manage

00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:22,169
our backups of our system so we do use

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,810
that you have a graphical install which

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,580
is what most people are going to use you

00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:27,960
also have a phils take visa mode in case

00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,550
you get into a situation where you have

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,000
a graphics driver it's just not

00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:34,620
cooperating quite right you can go with

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,880
that and hopefully if you get all ironed

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:37,979
out and then select whatever driver

00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,710
package adapter and we have to have a

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,720
text installer emergency console and it

00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:44,220
kind of doubles as both you can totally

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,540
go through an entire first install will

00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:52,919
not have to have any graphical user

00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:54,419
interface ball so this is going to be

00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,380
the first screen that you're greeted at

00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:00,270
when you start pc-bsd you'll see that

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,760
you can select your language which might

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,130
be important in english isn't the first

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,200
language you want to use and you'll have

00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,960
a couple other options you have loading

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:11,970
from USB which you have options

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,640
throughout the install to save your

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:17,130
whole configuration your disk setups

00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,870
your desktop environments however you

00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,030
set up your packages all that can just

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,070
be safe really easily to USB stick and

00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,630
if you're doing a lot of rollouts you

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,979
can just simply roll that same

00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:30,090
configuration out across multiple

00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,490
systems you'll also see in the in the

00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:35,460
bottom left of this window right here

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,770
that is our detected hardware window

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,180
this is just real nice and easy make

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,889
sure you check that out that way you

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,439
don't have to install operators

00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:44,730
just receive your hardware works so you

00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,459
do that just first thing in the

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,929
installer and I even see right here's

00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:51,179
that no Wi-Fi detective to that wasn't

00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:54,149
big deal this was a vm anyways so it's

00:08:51,179 --> 00:08:56,399
kind of expected we have some other

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,839
options down there that I don't really

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,910
have highlighted but you can have a

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,589
virtual keyboard there's also helpful

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,819
hints that can pop up and kind of help

00:09:01,589 --> 00:09:05,220
you guide you through the process but

00:09:02,819 --> 00:09:08,730
it's pretty intuitive I think any of you

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:11,279
would kind of be in use so then we would

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:13,079
just press next and then it would bring

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,869
us to our system selection screen so we

00:09:13,079 --> 00:09:18,299
have our desktop stuff which is what we

00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:20,639
consider pc-bsd that is going to be

00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:22,739
pre-configured to have all of the

00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,639
packages the graphical interface that

00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:26,720
you're going to need to run the

00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:29,579
workstation then we have a server

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,149
installed which is true OS now true OS

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:35,399
is just basically freebsd with some

00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:37,350
additional pc-bsd utility is command

00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,230
line utilities up on top of it but it is

00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:44,069
entire entirely CLI based or terminal

00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:47,299
based then we have another option to

00:09:44,069 --> 00:09:49,559
restore from the life preserver back up

00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:51,509
why preserver is going to be what

00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,009
actually backs up your entire system and

00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:54,389
that's awesome you can actually do a

00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,089
full install right here from the

00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:59,669
installer or a full restore actually

00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:00,660
apparently there's a press pass a button

00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:03,059
there that will allow you to select

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,069
different desktop environments we have

00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:07,470
many of those pre-loaded probably many

00:10:05,069 --> 00:10:09,209
of your favorite ones and you can also

00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:13,249
select different driver packages and

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:13,249
things of that nature at that time so

00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,899
this is the disc selection screen it's

00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:21,209
important to go ahead and press the

00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,249
customize button and select what

00:10:21,209 --> 00:10:26,999
partition you're going to be booting to

00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:29,249
pc-bsd will automatically take me drive

00:10:26,999 --> 00:10:31,230
if you do not specify now it will warn

00:10:29,249 --> 00:10:32,789
you it's pretty explicit it will say you

00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,279
know hey this is a full disc install

00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:37,619
make sure you really want to do this but

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,339
you know just keep that in mind you know

00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:43,669
I not that I've ever actually forgotten

00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:47,749
to do that on a production system yeah

00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:50,249
that's why we made it big and bold now

00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:52,319
so right here you can see you have a few

00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:52,760
different options you have basic which

00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,890
is just

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,170
to be switching between partitions

00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,560
basically you have an advanced mode

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:01,790
that's going to let you select some more

00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,800
in-depth options you can select your

00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:07,370
partition as well as interesting with

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,530
TBT for support a block size and then

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,050
also we have options to basically help

00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,220
out with solid state drive installations

00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:16,990
it will just automatically tune it for

00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,990
you to get the most out of that driveway

00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:25,130
with the ZFS filesystem we have the

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,860
software rate that we can automatically

00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,840
set up for you really nice and easy as

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,550
long as you have the drive to do it will

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,440
help you set it up it's really really

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:35,960
simple and straightforward so any kind

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,280
of rape that you might want to use we

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:43,340
can just set that up for you just

00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:44,890
automatically then we have a button to

00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,030
just go ahead and start the installation

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,380
so not a big deal there we've got

00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:50,750
everything the way we want if so we

00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:53,390
would just press yes and after that you

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:55,790
give it about 15 to 20 minutes depending

00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:58,490
on your packet is if you selected a que

00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:59,300
te or gnome 3 during install you know of

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:01,640
course it's going to take a little

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:03,650
longer but in general I mean it takes

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:06,260
about 15 to 20 minutes it's pretty fast

00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:07,790
installed and then you'll have one more

00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:10,010
chance to save that configuration the

00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:13,280
USB so you can recall that later on roll

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:15,410
it across the whole system so that point

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:18,700
we would just hit finish let this is

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,530
guru do of course take our disk you know

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:23,090
back from installer and then you'd be

00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,000
greeted by this nice 50 screen right

00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:27,980
here that says welcome to pc PST so nice

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,020
to me we don't put a lot of stuff on

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,580
there start with as you can see there's

00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:35,890
three icons and then your trade apps

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,890
forced to automatically come with

00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,970
so now that we talked about pc-bsd let's

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,410
talk about our utilities we're going to

00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,940
talk about our stock utilities that

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:47,650
we've had for a while for a minute and

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,150
then after that I'm going to talk to you

00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:50,320
guys to how some of our new development

00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:53,950
that we've been working on you'll be

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,770
getting excited another so we have the

00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,090
control panel the app cafe which is

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:02,050
going to be your package management and

00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:04,420
the warden for jail management the

00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:06,850
control panel is just exactly what you

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,850
would expect to be nice and orderly all

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:11,800
your system settings all in one place

00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:14,800
you have up there where the Red Square

00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,690
is kind of surrounding that that little

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,160
click box there and you can choose from

00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,000
a couple different options you can just

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,400
have a normal default pc-bsd control

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,960
down or you can select a hybrid control

00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,580
panel which will basically merge it in

00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,560
different desktop environment utilities

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,780
so if you have a utility you like an

00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,720
xfce you want to use it in kidding you

00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:36,370
would actually be able to use that

00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,660
across the different in a different

00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,060
desktop environment in the union's a

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,350
hybrid you have to remember that's a

00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:44,440
little bit more of an advanced features

00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,270
so can't say that all of the features

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,500
wouldn't play nice together but you know

00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:52,930
you do have that option that's an

00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:54,730
advanced user you want to do that so

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,460
here's the app cafe the app cafe is a

00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,170
fully searchable application catalog you

00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,350
can launch all of your applications from

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:04,990
one centralized place here you can

00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:06,760
actually also use it to manage package

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:09,640
installations on other systems so here's

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,260
the cool thing okay if you have a PC PSD

00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,340
box that you're sitting here using let's

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,830
just say that's that's what I'm using

00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:16,390
here and you have a true true a West box

00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,000
sitting over in the corner earth you

00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,740
know if you get Steve for that matter

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,780
during the true OS set up it'll actually

00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:26,230
prompt you to save you want to set this

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:28,600
up for remote package control you would

00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,820
just simply say yes type in whatever

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,560
credentials you wanted to use then you

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,990
can access it from the desktop machine

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,610
which is really really nice neat you

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,960
would just actually click that box where

00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:39,400
it says the local system there's a

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,470
little box there to the right of it and

00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:46,560
then you can select you want to install

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,560
your own pc-bsd system RO system

00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,240
it has a new PHP web interface for

00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:55,459
controlling package configurations we

00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,640
kind of did that to help out with these

00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:00,589
remotes with these remote parts control

00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:03,860
situations that we integrated into

00:15:00,589 --> 00:15:05,630
pc-bsd I do realize looking at it it's a

00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,850
little bit rough around the edges this

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:12,260
is still pretty new and we are still

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:15,500
getting themed and all set so you can

00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,329
actually add any girl any of our video

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,250
or all the desktop environments you want

00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:22,100
right here how are you installing the OS

00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:24,290
as a matter of fact you can install them

00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,300
and there's several you just log out and

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,930
log back into and you don't have to even

00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,490
reboot so that's pretty sweet you can

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,870
also add any additional drivers

00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,060
development tool kits really any

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:38,390
packages you want at that point that's

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,019
what app cafe is port now let's talk

00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:43,760
about the warden the word in an in-state

00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:46,250
jail management system you can create

00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:48,320
isolated versions let me talk about

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,450
earlier freebsd and this will just

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,310
manage them for you okay you all your

00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:55,220
tails be here so let's say that you

00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:56,870
wanted to run a key server and wanted to

00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,790
post a website or something you know

00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:01,610
inside this jail it'll have its own IP

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:03,320
address it will be completely isolated

00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,750
from the rest of your system if somebody

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,949
was to compromise that jail let's just

00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:09,860
say that you know there was a

00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:11,870
vulnerability somebody got unto that

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,310
Jill that hosts your website they are

00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:15,589
not going to be able to touch the rest

00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,050
of the system or other jails so it's

00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:20,630
very very safe and secure a very good

00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:23,480
idea you're posting multiple things like

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,649
that there's three types of GLS what

00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,589
I've been talking about is the

00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,390
traditional freebsd jail we also have a

00:16:27,589 --> 00:16:31,339
ports gel which is just gives you a

00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,440
little more freedom with using ports and

00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:37,399
we have Linux shells which we consider

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,769
experimental do they work yes are they

00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:41,810
difficult to configure probably it

00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:43,940
depends on your set up there are several

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:45,709
people I know that run them but there

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,690
are going to be situations where you

00:16:45,709 --> 00:16:51,649
might want to seek help or somebody who

00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:54,529
is a little more understanding how the

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:55,880
warden works to get that function but we

00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,529
have a very different community we've

00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,949
let you lie to have any of you guys on

00:16:57,529 --> 00:16:59,949
IRC

00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:06,530
you can also export import jails between

00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,780
systems and that doesn't exclude any

00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:10,790
type of any type of freebsd system in

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,750
other words if you want to move a jail

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:16,430
from a freebsd system to a pc-bsd system

00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,470
you can do that do you want to move a

00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,530
jail from a pc-bsd system to a true OS

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,350
system you can do that as well it's also

00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:26,780
available as a min line application or

00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:29,060
as the GUI based application so you can

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,650
if you're just doing a server basements

00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:35,450
volume in totally different from command

00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:38,150
line is very easy games alright star

00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,760
general utilities we have a preserver

00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:43,760
that manages your automatic data backups

00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,810
that will be your full system backups we

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,100
have a couple different kinds we're

00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:50,120
going to talk about here just a minute

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,530
we also have the mount rate which is

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:55,160
just a simple utility for mounting

00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:56,360
external devices it works in any any of

00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,470
the desktop environments so you don't

00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,840
have to have a different one for each

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,730
one and we also have the pulseaudio

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,710
configuration utility we did pull it in

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:05,270
pulseaudio it offers us a little extra

00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,570
compatibility with some of these

00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:10,610
learnings apps that run in our emulation

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,590
we have a boot manager which is our

00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,870
prepa to front end manager or give you

00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,130
for that the network manager of the

00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:18,320
managers your wired or wireless

00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:20,930
connections south configuration where

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,370
you can just select your microphone

00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:24,380
inputs you can switch easily between

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:26,270
them just from the trade out so really

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,590
nice and easy you don't have to open up

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:31,280
a big utility and switch everything

00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:33,350
around there's tons more but I can't

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,320
mention all of them obviously because we

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:40,280
have we have a whole bunch but I

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:42,290
mentioned the big ones today so life

00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:45,140
preserver it's a easy to use backup

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:47,450
interface for pc-bsd this will take an

00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,240
entire ZFS system snapshot of your

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,610
pc-bsd system you can schedule backups

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,960
as frequently as you want or it's not

00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:56,390
crippled into one you know however

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,950
however you want to do it and you can

00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,170
remotely replicate your system to a

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,930
previous d-box the true OS box or

00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,900
freenas to report abusive one that is

00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:07,790
built in to this and like you saw

00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:10,160
earlier where there is that restore

00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:11,990
button you do have the option to

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,890
do a bare-metal full system restore from

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:19,040
the Installer so I'll show you guys a

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:20,780
couple of pictures of life preserver

00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,580
here right here you can see this is the

00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,680
snapshot schedule screen and you can

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,840
just easily pick however you want to

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,490
just however you want to set up you

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:30,890
don't have to be worried I know you see

00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,030
five minutes there and you're like well

00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,040
if it's backing up every five minutes

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:36,620
isn't it can be huge but the way that

00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,590
ZFS works is when that backup is

00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:42,620
creative it literally has there's

00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:45,170
literally no file size okay it's only

00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:47,690
going to grow as it changes from the

00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:49,490
original okay so as you doing more

00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,560
changes and use further away and when

00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,240
that snapshot was created it will grow a

00:19:51,560 --> 00:20:01,550
little bit still they're very convincing

00:19:53,240 --> 00:20:03,140
sighs and that I easy to manage all

00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:04,760
right so here we go this is just showing

00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,680
you the folder structure basically after

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,420
you have your backup done you can easily

00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,370
just go through the folder structure

00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,680
look for whatever file you need or you

00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:15,380
can choose to roll back several folders

00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:17,350
if you so wish that's what it looks like

00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,340
if you're going to do a life preserver

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,050
restore you would just basically browse

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,230
for it and that can be right there and

00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:26,210
selected you'll see a slider bar right

00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,470
there kind of in the middle is this pink

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,200
one back up and then it has a whole

00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,670
bunch of numbers date after that that

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,170
slider bar is just going to let you

00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:35,240
slide back and forth between your

00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,970
backups so that'll just be different

00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,760
dates in time so that's what that's for

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,020
there's tons of other features advanced

00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,160
features i'm not going to go into those

00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,250
two and depth but if you want to know

00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:48,320
more later definitely stop by the pcbs d

00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:53,960
previous use later on we'll talk more on

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:56,120
top now two environments we're very

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,610
proud of food environments they are a

00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,370
feature that's pretty much exclusive to

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:03,230
ZFS what it does is it snapshots all of

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:05,120
your system files and configurations I

00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,190
do mean just your system files and

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:08,570
configurations it's not going to back up

00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:10,220
your home directory that's got all your

00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,250
videos or all your music or all your

00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,320
documents in it this is basically if you

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,020
get into a situation where you're

00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,850
modifying your ex or calm and something

00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,909
kind of goes a little sideways you can't

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,220
get back into your graph

00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:25,889
system you can actually just from the

00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:28,470
grub to boot loader you can just simply

00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:30,809
select an older boot environment and it

00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,289
will instantaneously move you into an

00:21:30,809 --> 00:21:36,239
older version pc-bsd that worked now

00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:37,619
that is dependent in that case if you're

00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:39,749
going to be messing around with like

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,119
some some of the more heavy

00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:43,979
configuration files you know you need to

00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:48,269
remember to go ahead and kick off a

00:21:43,979 --> 00:21:50,429
snapshot in that case but at any rate

00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:51,539
it's very very useful if you know you're

00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,080
going to be modifying a bunch of

00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,580
configuration files it's extremely fast

00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,440
I kind of already mentioned that it is

00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,259
literally instantaneous than you click a

00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,299
button it's done so that backup of your

00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,789
system in configuration files is just

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:08,369
ready to go in case something goes wrong

00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:10,529
I put less than five seconds just

00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,909
because honestly I don't know maybe on a

00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,619
slower system it might take a little

00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:17,399
longer but I mean I've even used it on

00:22:13,619 --> 00:22:18,359
one gigabyte of memory on a ZFS system

00:22:17,399 --> 00:22:22,139
and it was still just about

00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:24,029
instantaneous so very very fast you can

00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:26,129
move between environments for different

00:22:24,029 --> 00:22:27,869
types of setups for your system let's

00:22:26,129 --> 00:22:29,970
say that you have your system configured

00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:32,669
basically to run through a private proxy

00:22:29,970 --> 00:22:34,590
or something on 11 new department and

00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:37,169
you have it just set to take defaults

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,179
for its internet route another that's

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:41,249
easily done you can totally do that and

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:45,119
just select the grub to boot loader

00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:46,950
between the two new one but with

00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,019
environments are also a lot of math and

00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,820
creative doing major package changes now

00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:52,470
this is really really cool this is part

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,789
of our love date managers features and

00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:57,119
we're going to talk about it more in a

00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:59,519
second but basically when whenever there

00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,200
is an update for your pc-bsd system we

00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,590
go ahead and we kick off that system

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,820
snapshot for you and in case anything

00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,379
goes sideways say you're on the

00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,330
developers brand you like to live

00:23:07,379 --> 00:23:10,710
dangerously and you're testing out a lot

00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:13,049
of the new features that are coming out

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:14,999
you may get in a situation where you do

00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,679
need to definitely roll back to an

00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,269
earlier system snapshot so we just do

00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:23,940
that by default every time there's an

00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:25,259
updates as it is instantaneous so i'm

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,330
going to show you our boot manager this

00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:31,200
is basically our grub to you ate let's

00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:32,729
just manage anything new throw to it

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,930
will let you easily manage any of your

00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:36,730
ZFS system snapshots that which

00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:39,220
talk about your boot environments you

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,540
can easily and safely remove any of them

00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,970
it won't let you remove the one that

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,460
you're running that would be bad but it

00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:47,830
does not allow you to do that so you can

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,200
see here that I have one two three four

00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,840
five six boot environments on the screen

00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,120
the top one I kicked off by myself and

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,430
named alpha at that top one since I

00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:00,790
specified that I wanted it kicked off by

00:23:57,430 --> 00:24:02,950
itself that one will stay static it will

00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:04,420
not go away but these other ones will

00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,340
see if the very bottom of that window

00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,740
where says maximum auto-generated new

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:10,150
environments these other ones will be

00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,010
automatically proven since they were

00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:17,950
just automatically done by the system

00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:19,810
when updates were done then we have the

00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:22,720
update manager which keeps your system

00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,730
up to date and in sync automatically so

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,010
basically if you are off on a certain

00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:29,260
pattern set if you are on our enterprise

00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:32,050
branch which is our extended release you

00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:34,150
can select from that basically all that

00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,470
branch the only thing between is with

00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,460
that branch is going to need security

00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,720
updates and packages will change very

00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,510
infrequently and we kind of leave that

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,000
more up to the the user if they're going

00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:47,740
to be updating those then we have the

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,200
production branch production branch

00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,060
updates every about every three months

00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:54,880
it will get security updates of course

00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,730
as they happen those out immediately if

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,290
we find a security issue then we have a

00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,030
dead branch which is our developers

00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:02,890
branch that's usually the branch that

00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:04,650
that's apparent i live on the most the

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:08,710
developers and a lot of our volunteers

00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:10,600
will help us to diagnose some issues new

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:12,970
packages and things like that you can

00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,800
totally use but you will run into

00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,660
occasions where you may need to build

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:19,030
more an advanced user and comfortable at

00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:21,420
least with going into a terminal if we

00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:25,240
need to assist you in helping you with

00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:27,010
something you can see right there you

00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,930
can select from everything you could

00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,210
have just managed security packages or

00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,100
you can have managed nothing just keep

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,810
in mind if you just said to do nothing

00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,100
you are completely responsible for

00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:39,310
managing any of that disk read your

00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,350
system including the security I do

00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:43,480
realize those some some users just want

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:45,100
to have that control though over the way

00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,789
they they want to do their packages

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,629
which is why

00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:51,009
can provide that option all right so now

00:25:49,629 --> 00:25:53,109
that we've talked about some of our

00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:54,309
utilities we've had for a while we're

00:25:53,109 --> 00:25:57,789
going to talk about the new direction

00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:59,710
pc-bsd has been pointing in our and

00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:02,859
already focused on security for the end

00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:06,759
user the gang in late 2014 we started to

00:26:02,859 --> 00:26:08,769
kind of think in more terms of you know

00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:10,330
it's not just windows computers it's not

00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,519
just Mac computers anymore in any

00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,639
computer that you know accessible the

00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:17,909
Internet can be very easily compromised

00:26:15,639 --> 00:26:21,309
these days if a person has the right

00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:23,679
right knowledge so what we've done is

00:26:21,309 --> 00:26:25,059
we've started to develop new utilities

00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:29,080
that are going to help users and protect

00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:30,659
themselves and protect their data so to

00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,460
do that we created in stealth sessions

00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:35,769
persona crepes in Tour mode which some

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,509
of you we didn't obviously create Tour

00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:39,639
mode we just integrate it into the

00:26:37,509 --> 00:26:42,609
operating system that's where you may be

00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:43,989
the only restore mode so with still

00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:46,179
sessions I feel like it's important to

00:26:43,989 --> 00:26:47,619
say this is something that is totally up

00:26:46,179 --> 00:26:50,409
to the administrator to turn on or off

00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:52,029
it's not a default but if you want to

00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,220
have stealth sessions on what it does is

00:26:52,029 --> 00:26:55,809
it will create an empty home directory

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,059
for you basically it's mounted s is

00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:01,479
equal and then it's destroyed a fog out

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:05,200
it uses a one-time key encryption so

00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:07,330
once that session is ended and you log

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,039
out or shut down your computer that key

00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,450
is then lost with the directory and

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,759
since it was never actually saved or

00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:14,200
anything like that then you know you do

00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:19,929
not have to fear about your data ever

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:21,909
being compromised in that situation we

00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:23,349
also have a persona crypt persona crypt

00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:26,349
is a really awesome new feature that

00:27:23,349 --> 00:27:28,210
will allow you to put an encrypted a

00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:31,059
fully encrypted home directory on an

00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:34,720
external media device for instance and

00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:36,849
pc-bsd project we use USB three solid

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,099
state drives that we have hooked up and

00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:41,139
we have boolean group did home

00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:43,899
directories with persona crypt you can

00:27:41,139 --> 00:27:46,169
do this with during install or from our

00:27:43,899 --> 00:27:49,659
user manager utility after the fact is

00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:52,570
formatted using GPT the ZFS filesystem

00:27:49,659 --> 00:27:54,519
and jelly encryption and it can also be

00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:56,630
called for maternal instance as well if

00:27:54,519 --> 00:27:58,640
you do have servants

00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:02,360
you that you want to use this for now

00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,130
the cool thing about that is and let me

00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,960
explain a little more about it it will

00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:08,420
only work on the system that generated

00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,000
the original key ok so somebody takes

00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:12,500
that key and you know say it got stolen

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,590
or something and they try to pop it into

00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,240
another pc-bsd box or any box for that

00:28:15,590 --> 00:28:19,610
matter it will not work in that other

00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,130
pc-bsd system and since it is fully

00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:25,450
encrypted you know that that would be

00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,560
extremely difficult to compromise that

00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:29,000
you'll see here on this window right

00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:32,510
here we have a couple of different

00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,100
options under change password one that

00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:36,080
says initialize device you would click

00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,120
initialize advise if you wanted to set a

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,980
new user as a person upper fuser in our

00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:41,690
news we have internal what that would do

00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,340
is just prompt you it would say hey I'm

00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,470
going to erase this USB stick that I

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,140
detected is that okay and you would just

00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:49,970
allow to do so then it would initialize

00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:52,280
the back to work with this computer that

00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,800
you initialize com now if you want to

00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:56,720
take a key stick that you use on say

00:28:54,800 --> 00:29:00,200
your desktop and you want to add a

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,720
persona crypt a user to a laptop you can

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,760
then use this import key function so as

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,040
long as you know your key you just

00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,840
simply type your key in or you know you

00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:10,940
have it encrypted you know somewhere

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,860
else or something you would just import

00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:16,160
that heat at that time and then you

00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:18,770
would be able to use that encrypted

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,480
persona device on both devices in that

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:22,610
case and then you can also of course i

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:29,240
revoke privileges if you want to in that

00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:32,210
case so tor moto tour mode is something

00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:33,770
we added very recently it will allow you

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,910
to browse anonymously via the Tor

00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,560
network some of you may be familiar

00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:38,990
there are some linux distros that know

00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:41,570
that habit built-in we've actually built

00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:43,580
it directly into our update managers

00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,740
right-click menu so if you want to turn

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:47,930
it on with just a couple of simple clips

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:50,120
you can do so you would just right click

00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:53,510
on the update manager icon and then just

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,070
select they'll enable remote it won't

00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:57,200
fear on reboot which is awesome it's

00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:58,970
going to persist so you have it set to

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,910
run through Tour mode it's going to stay

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,440
that way until you tell it not to it

00:30:01,910 --> 00:30:05,150
will automatically adjust your firewall

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,670
for you so you don't have to be an

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,930
advanced user and benefit from it we

00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,620
were just talking to set all of those

00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:12,210
rules for you and then

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:17,640
horse change the back if you decide to

00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:19,500
disable it all right so now that we

00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,360
talked about those I'll show you guys

00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,059
something the desktop environments is

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,050
piece of work that was worth we have que

00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:29,340
te xfce the Lumina desktop environment

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:32,460
which is actually developed by the

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:35,730
pc-bsd team ourselves we have known

00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,160
three cinnamon lxde and there's tons

00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,750
more you know I would know exactly how

00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,130
many there are the top of my head but

00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:43,260
there are a bunch and if you have a

00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:49,050
favorite on linux that one month a 400

00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:51,960
EST so here's just a screen just to show

00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:54,390
you kind of what que te looks like you

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,610
know with a basic theme and with PCBs

00:30:54,390 --> 00:31:01,200
installed this is what it's going to

00:30:56,610 --> 00:31:05,550
look like for you or xfce if you're

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,679
familiar with that and then i want to

00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,540
talk a little more in depth of alumina

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,880
desktop environment this is actually a

00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:15,330
desktop environment that was created by

00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,480
Kim more at the PCB st project it is

00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:19,890
completely and fully bsd license which

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,270
we've actually found there's actually a

00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:24,750
lot of people out there that have found

00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:26,600
a lot of vitamin that it was designed to

00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:29,340
offer vista maximum performance

00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:34,650
functionality while also streamlining

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:38,460
your overhead so is to design a very

00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:40,770
compact very fast very responsive it's a

00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,270
minimal size last I checked it was 33

00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:44,490
megabytes that may have grown in just

00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,140
the last last month I just a little bit

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,390
but is still extremely extremely small

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:52,500
and that is it with dependencies so very

00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:54,960
very small it still is beta stage but

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,179
it's very functional it has a lot of

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,460
features that are already built in that

00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:01,890
maybe other desktop environments don't

00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:04,590
even have so I definitely check it out

00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:06,900
it has some very very cool features and

00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:11,429
it is designed to work a hundred percent

00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:13,170
with pc-bsd it's also available for many

00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:17,429
popular Linux distributions including

00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:19,679
debian arch linux and slackware and you

00:32:17,429 --> 00:32:20,880
can also use auto store functionality is

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,360
built directly in

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,160
to incite file manager so that is super

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,840
super cool if you are actually browsing

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,420
for a file you have one of those Oh

00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,730
proud moments you know either you know

00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:34,800
somebody got my computer you know one of

00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:36,600
the kids is messing with it you know how

00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,190
I hope that wouldn't happen but if

00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,660
something like that did happen you can

00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,240
just easily roll back to a previous

00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:44,310
version of that file or recover the

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:51,470
followed right there from the file

00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:53,850
manager so and then there's a picture

00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:57,270
right there at illumina desktop

00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:59,460
environment so you i do have iphones on

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:02,100
there they're kind of hidden and from

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:03,780
that drop-down menu right there but

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,400
there's just three icons so they're just

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,660
kind of covered up there but then you

00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,310
just of course have your date time and

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,740
you know whatever plugins that are

00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,970
running in the background for pc-bsd you

00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,730
have this video over here on the

00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:17,220
left-hand side of the on the right hand

00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:21,900
side of the screen that will basically

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:25,350
show you your different applications

00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:30,360
that you have installed so nice and easy

00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:32,670
to use very sleek and unmolested all

00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,570
right so we'll talk about the highlights

00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:39,990
for pc-bsd at this time it is free

00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:42,180
completely free to use in any situation

00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:44,160
you can employ on as many systems as you

00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:46,860
want and servers that you want it can

00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,080
run as a server so issue it uses the

00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,470
freebsd simplified license which is

00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:54,660
small and user in business friendly and

00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:56,580
it has a simplified gui-based install

00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,380
that is similar to a lot of the

00:33:56,580 --> 00:34:00,000
graphical linux is that hopefully you

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:02,250
might be comfortable with if you come

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,200
from a linux background we're very

00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:05,730
focused at this point on security for

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,129
the end user and look for that to

00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:09,270
continue going forward we're going to

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:13,110
put more and more of our development

00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:15,800
time into making sure the software is

00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:18,000
just even more and more secure forward

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,629
we have a good environments which

00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,190
obviously let you roll back to previous

00:34:20,629 --> 00:34:25,889
system States I'm actually kick those

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:27,260
out or if you have an update to your

00:34:25,889 --> 00:34:29,030
packages

00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:32,000
it will be automatically keep operating

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:35,330
and then we have the lumina desktop

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,179
environment that is I pcbs DS team and

00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:41,270
resources so we actually has been quite

00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:43,490
a bit of time of work and work on the

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,950
lumina developing that every single week

00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:48,320
so if you want something that is just

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:50,659
absolutely designed to work as well as

00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:54,280
humanly possible with PTSD the moment

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,280
maybe think desktop environment for you

00:34:55,090 --> 00:35:00,140
all right so with that being said I've

00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:03,680
kind of reached the end of the top

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,900
portion this day and i'll go ahead and

00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:15,320
open the floor for questions if you guys

00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:17,210
have any linux jails is that the guests

00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,640
are not running with learning center

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:24,110
space so the question was with lens gels

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,740
is that basically the bsd colonel

00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:30,350
running with the linux user space is why

00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:33,220
you've said basically what it is I mean

00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,990
it the freebsd kernel is running but

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,360
when you're setting up that linux jail I

00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:43,760
mean we're actually running a script

00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:51,950
basically to basically to configure it

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:53,090
with the with the big let me I tell you

00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:57,890
what I'm going to do I'm going to do

00:35:53,090 --> 00:36:00,890
some port yeah it is ok button volt

00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:04,640
becomes with scripts to install Debian

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:09,200
yep what is it Jessica yes yeah Jimmy

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,480
you in dfw so those ones are very easy

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,830
to run with the bsd which is why i

00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:18,110
suppose but if i can run start scripts

00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,480
for other linux distributions as long as

00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,950
april so this didn't yet it's not

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,670
actually installing so the answer is i

00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:27,890
watch this user yeah so the answer that

00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:31,520
question was yes that tape so that I

00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:36,980
appreciate your help Darrell now anyone

00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:38,990
else yeah features are they

00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:44,930
on dizzy as best analysis from what

00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:46,640
longest work features and also yes he we

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:49,490
talked about how thick wants to do

00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:52,040
backups to CFS basically do a hash to

00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:55,430
the class system and is that house

00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:57,619
workers are doing it basically on file

00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,900
level lot of work to do your hash you've

00:36:57,619 --> 00:37:04,910
been running for differences not and

00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:08,480
reconstructing that how is that working

00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:11,780
so so basically the question was is is

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,880
the lot of utilities that pc-bsd is

00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:16,700
running are they dependent on ZFS and

00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:19,369
also your question was kind of how how

00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:21,760
is the ZFS filesystem doing the instant

00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:24,560
backups that we kind of talked about so

00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,590
first of all yes it is entirely

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,660
dependent on the ZFS filesystem now with

00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:32,630
that being said you can set up Z balls

00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:36,050
with ZFS and actually run so you wanted

00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:37,430
to have a ufs data set running on the

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:39,619
system you can do that you can actually

00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:41,990
have multiple different kinds running on

00:37:39,619 --> 00:37:44,000
it but they are entirely dependent on

00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:47,180
the ZFS filesystem we kind of mine

00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:49,369
exclusively to ZFS to take advantage of

00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:51,109
those awesome features with the instant

00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:53,720
restore now to answer your other

00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:58,000
question about how its kind of doing it

00:37:53,720 --> 00:38:01,070
is using checks and hashes to basically

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,570
that's basically what it's doing the way

00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:05,359
it's been explained to me and I'm by no

00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,250
means a ZFS expert if you want to find

00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,020
out a whole bunch more on ZFS I

00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:13,480
encourage you to look online for jewel

00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:15,560
amines talk on ZFS but drew drew louie

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,240
truly mean she works with us over the

00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:19,430
pc-bsd project and she is our resident

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,840
expert on it and a lot of her talks are

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:22,369
already on there but the way that it's

00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:24,369
explained to me is it's basically like

00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:27,350
it's leaving a series of pointers

00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:29,680
basically to show it from each snapshot

00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:32,600
how to get back to its original version

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,000
then when you make another snapshot it's

00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:37,790
getting back to that last last snapshot

00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,560
so but yeah it is using a series of

00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:41,400
checks and hashes that is if you can

00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,820
down to the base that is

00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:48,630
as long as I'm hopeful that yeah it's

00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:52,800
doing those caches looks really not I'm

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:56,070
leaving a lot of data so it just does it

00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,410
work on like the implication across the

00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:01,830
back outsourcing doing an impression

00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:04,470
possible and that work job would it be

00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:06,540
something that smells good at that

00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:09,480
fashion across the network you're saying

00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,120
is I mean yeah I mean totally it that's

00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,030
actually where ZFS is the strongest is

00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:18,030
moving data large amounts of data huge

00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,770
amounts of data you know across and that

00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:22,470
works however you want to do it it has

00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,840
some ridiculous hi cap I mean I can't

00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:27,240
even remember how high but it's it's

00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:29,760
it's it's ridiculously huge it'd be very

00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:39,030
difficult to reach that yeah thanks for

00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:43,170
your question anybody else yeah how big

00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:45,390
is the team working on a CG is the team

00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:48,810
that works exclusively on BCBS d is

00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:50,760
three people it's myself is the lead

00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:53,820
developer of his crystal more he's the

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,740
person in that design pc-bsd about eight

00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,320
or nine years ago and started as just a

00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:01,350
hockey for him and then also his brother

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,210
kenmore works on the project so if you

00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:06,480
see a pc-bsd talk it'll probably one of

00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:08,520
us order levine with drew's that we have

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,350
four people she handles documentation

00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:13,800
and then I handle the Quality Assurance

00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:16,290
I do a lot of bug tracking and reporting

00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,200
all that fun bug management stuff that's

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,240
usually calls on me so we have a poor

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,720
people that work directly on it and then

00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:26,760
of course freebsd is huge they have huge

00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:28,170
huge teams of people working on several

00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,570
different sections of the operating

00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:32,310
systems so hopefully that gives you a

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:37,230
good idea but that's that's how many you

00:40:32,310 --> 00:40:40,080
have working directly on it yes just a

00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:42,210
sore subject but the change of

00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:46,410
surveillance distributions to exist

00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:49,270
indeed yes that EST concord source

00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:52,030
development I mean

00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:56,880
it was quite Oracle recently you know

00:40:52,030 --> 00:41:00,340
you would have enough I guess

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:05,530
similarities between lenox and right EST

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:06,820
that you basically library better I'm

00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:09,880
just wondering yeah that's going to

00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:13,060
affect DSD in the future so the question

00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:15,820
is basically how how is systemd going to

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:18,310
be affecting our development with PTSD

00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:20,830
because historically in the past we've

00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:23,020
been so close we consider ourselves very

00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:24,820
close cousins to each other so that we

00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,990
can take software back and forth we can

00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,250
pour things from one experience

00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:32,290
installation vice versa I'd imagine so

00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,670
the way that it's impacted us there's a

00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:36,250
couple different ways it's impacted us

00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:38,110
if you're just talking about we've seen

00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,750
a lot of users that have come over from

00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:44,800
linux that are not happy with the way

00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:46,510
system z is done you know it's kind of

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,070
one of those things to each their own

00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,680
there's a lot of people that liked it as

00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:53,290
far as development how it's going to

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,450
affect us we haven't really seen any

00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:57,880
real ways that is impacting us at this

00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:01,300
time but those may become more apparent

00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,650
as that riff grows a little bit we may

00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,690
have to get a little more creative in

00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,930
finding ways to make that work but at

00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:11,260
this time we have not seen in any great

00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:12,730
customs that we can't bridge so far no

00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:14,680
that's not a great answer because it's

00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:18,070
not really you know there's just not a

00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:19,660
lot that we have right now to know but

00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:22,960
you know hopefully going forward we'll

00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:26,220
know a little more about that thanks

00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:30,550
great question again anybody else yeah

00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:36,550
system heart he has affected a few

00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:39,040
things like we come we have a poor play

00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,560
a little a question or anything like

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:43,580
that because it does have

00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:48,660
never see on which is not a sookie now

00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:52,020
so there are some quiet ones like this

00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:54,960
but it's not like you want you to wait

00:42:52,020 --> 00:43:00,150
over here and pretty much every lot but

00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,120
if you read anything else right now is

00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:04,740
so Ali was basically explaining that

00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:08,910
there has been a little bit of an impact

00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:12,780
with freebsd itself so appreciate you

00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:16,790
speaking up and telling us that is there

00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:16,790
anyone else that has any questions today

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,680
if not you can always stop by the booth

00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:24,120
and find me afterwards I want to thank

00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,860
you guys so much for stopping by it

00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,140
means alot to me I know a lot of you

00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,180
guys stop by the biz thanks so much for
