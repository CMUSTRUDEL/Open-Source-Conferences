which is going on right now in Atlanta

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:11,849
so perhaps you're at the wrong self all

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:13,590
right so with that out of the way yeah

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:18,840
if you're watching the self hashtag you

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:23,310
find interesting things alright with

00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,959
that out of the way real quickly so I'm

00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:27,269
a recovering sysadmin i worked in

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,769
operations for about a decade and i

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:33,329
still have the scars and all of the all

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:36,810
the emotional baggage that comes with

00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:38,400
carrying a pager for 10 years i'm now a

00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,590
director at the apache software

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,590
foundation and i also run the

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:45,780
infrastructure group there separately

00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,510
from that because the foundation is a

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,970
corporate entity keeps a pretty bright

00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,650
line separation i'm on the project

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,430
management committee for a number of

00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,700
projects at the asf notably j clouds

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:00,810
which is a cloud abstraction library

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:03,810
cloudstack which is an infrastructure as

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,720
a service platform and the attack Apache

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:11,459
Incubator which is how projects come

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,870
into the asf and Citrix employs me and I

00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:16,350
work in the open source business office

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:19,560
at citrix and so I've been around for a

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:21,510
little while doing cloud stuff and and

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,420
before that I was involved in things

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:29,190
like fedora where I worked for a number

00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,630
of years and got involved in a number of

00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,609
things there but I want to ask some

00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:34,980
questions of you because now you know

00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:37,410
everything about me and I only know a

00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,049
few things about you one of them is that

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,590
you're here very early so let me ask you

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,959
some questions how many people are using

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:48,150
open source software here anybody not

00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:52,019
maybe that's the better question okay

00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,370
one outlier our contrarian how many

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:58,680
people are using it in their work

00:03:53,370 --> 00:04:01,049
environment okay almost everyone how

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,260
many of this group are contributing to

00:04:01,049 --> 00:04:07,510
an open source project okay

00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,239
so if you've seen how many people in the

00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:13,150
room are raising their hands it's an

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,500
order of magnitude less for people who

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,049
are contributing compared to people who

00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,479
are using open source in a commercial

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,820
environment I do know that you know I'm

00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:24,669
i am asking these questions at an open

00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,440
source conference so I'm probably

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,550
actually getting a higher return that I

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:33,490
would that I would expect otherwise but

00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,410
let's talk about I want to talk about

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,100
some history when we're talking about

00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:44,370
tragedy so let's talk about anyone

00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:47,130
recognize this logo this is heartbleed

00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:52,330
anyone have pain caused by heartbleed I

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:55,090
did ah so if you're not familiar

00:04:52,330 --> 00:05:00,539
heartbleed was a security book found

00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:04,630
with the open SSL encryption library and

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:10,090
it was found in April of 2014 and it was

00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:12,940
horrendous if if you believe Forbes they

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,560
said that it is the worst vulnerability

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:21,580
found in software since traffic began

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,750
progressing over the Internet and there

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,699
were a number of things that we learned

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:39,010
out of that you raising your hand for

00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:42,099
something um yes well so maybe by impact

00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:45,130
in terms of impact it may not be the

00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:48,340
worst in terms of true exploitability

00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:53,050
but I think in terms of impact that it

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:56,639
had that that's true one of the things

00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,889
we did learn though is exactly how

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,470
openssl was being cared for anyone know

00:05:59,889 --> 00:06:04,060
how many people were working on openssl

00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:08,080
full-time at the time of the bug was

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:10,840
discovered one one person was being paid

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:15,490
full-time anyone want to know how much

00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,310
he was paid for that work 20 grand a

00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,990
year

00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:21,840
exciting opportunities for your career

00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,560
in open source can make 20 grand a year

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,849
maintaining something quarter to the

00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,860
security of the Internet yeah so one guy

00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:33,219
that there are there since been more

00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:35,590
people and actually for the year leading

00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,810
up to heartbleed the total income

00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:40,900
brought in our total donations brought

00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:48,210
into the openssl foundation two thousand

00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:51,789
dollars think about that for a second so

00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,039
when you when you look at when you look

00:06:51,789 --> 00:06:56,560
at a lot of the analysis that was done

00:06:54,039 --> 00:07:02,680
after a lot of people said oh openssl is

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:04,449
too complex openssl is you know they

00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,789
didn't have enough people reviewing and

00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:09,099
all of these problems that people cited

00:07:06,789 --> 00:07:12,520
many of them technical and they're valid

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:16,419
points but someone said what we have is

00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,370
an economic problem our software is not

00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:22,770
sustaining itself from an economic

00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:26,139
perspective anyone recognize that logo

00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:28,240
this is shell shock anybody want to

00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:35,580
guess how many maintain errs there were

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:39,699
four bash when shell shock came out one

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:44,139
this is this is a common theme right one

00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:49,029
person and shell shock is Chet Ramey is

00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:52,620
was the maintainer again one person who

00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:55,620
was focused on this full time and

00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:58,839
everyone else is doing it you know as

00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:02,529
they saw fit which is fine that's that's

00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:06,310
how open source grew up right is people

00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:08,370
would people would work on it to scratch

00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:11,289
an itch and that's still perfectly valid

00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:13,599
but when you consider how crucial this

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,689
is how many systems it affected because

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,330
it wasn't just desktop machines it

00:08:16,689 --> 00:08:21,610
wasn't just you know servers running

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,560
somewhere a lot of appliances were had

00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:30,599
bash as the default shell so

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,599
shell-shocked is yet another example

00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:40,400
anyone read this article and ProPublica

00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:51,980
all right so it's too early for that

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:56,890
loud thank you sir so this article in

00:08:51,980 --> 00:09:01,460
ProPublica broke if you use encryption

00:08:56,890 --> 00:09:08,750
from g PG or PG p you're probably using

00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:11,230
this guy's canoe PG tools one guy at one

00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,790
point again another pattern here one guy

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,460
he was averaging actually he was doing a

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:22,160
little better than the ssl guys he was

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:23,450
averaging about 26,000 a year and he had

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,480
gotten some grants from the federal

00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:29,330
government in germany and they allowed

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,600
him to hire an intern at one point but

00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:36,110
then that funding ran out so again

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,850
another core library that a lot of

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,000
people depend on maybe not to the same

00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:43,940
degree as ssl but it's a big deal

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,830
nonetheless and we discover hey there's

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,800
only one guy paying attention but you

00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:55,130
know this isn't even limited to that

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,320
anyone here familiar with code house no

00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,290
okay code house is based in australia

00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,360
was based in australia and they provided

00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:06,230
project hosting and support so they

00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,630
would do mailing lists and bug trackers

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:12,080
they provided a jira instance and a

00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:18,410
confluence instance and places like

00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:20,240
maven and groovy and grails ran there

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,970
along with scores of others i mean

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,170
literally hundreds of projects and this

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:31,340
year early this year in march they said

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,320
you know we can't sustain this and what

00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:36,590
they determined was they become so

00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,390
popular that their bandwidth and server

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:41,360
costs were so great that it was out

00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:42,950
stripping their donations and people

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,420
were having to pay a thousand dollars

00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:48,260
out of their own pocket

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,910
just to keep servers online and it's not

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:53,060
like they didn't have free resources

00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:56,450
donated so contagious for instance

00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,620
donated most of the infrastructure for

00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:03,170
code house but it still wasn't enough an

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,910
India at the end of the day code house

00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,279
and all of the projects there had to

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:09,889
find a new home and and it went shut it

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:14,690
shut down and here's the obligatory Star

00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:16,519
Wars reference you know we we

00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:19,220
essentially lost this resource that

00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,060
people had gone grown accustomed to for

00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:26,959
over a decade and you know code house

00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:29,510
was probably the European and Australian

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:32,180
equivalent of sourceforge at the time

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:34,339
and instead of people slowly migrating

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,290
away as they did with sourceforge a lot

00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:40,070
of people were still very active at code

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:46,639
house and despite all of the good work

00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:49,070
they did that disappeared so with that

00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:52,070
is a framework just kind of some of the

00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:53,709
recent history in the past year or so I

00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:58,459
want to talk about some other things

00:11:53,709 --> 00:12:00,980
ways of evaluating some of this so at

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,360
the asf for whatever reason there are

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,730
some people who are fascinated with

00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:09,740
ponies and so some of the math has taken

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:12,560
on pony references and one of them is

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,720
Pony factor it's a way that we we

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,820
evaluate projects it's one factor it's

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:23,209
not not the only one so as a director at

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,100
the asf I have about 70 projects in mind

00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:29,329
that submit a report to the board and

00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,519
the nine directors go through each of

00:12:29,329 --> 00:12:33,730
those reports and we also look at

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,410
statistics around the project we look at

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:38,360
you know how many emails are traversing

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:40,160
the list how many commits are happening

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,500
how many releases of software have

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,680
occurred and projects report to us

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:48,620
generally on a quarterly basis so we've

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:53,269
got a little over two hundred and two

00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:54,290
about 70 a month submit a report so one

00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:56,510
of the things that I care about is

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,290
sustainability and it's one of the

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:01,769
things that I'm looking for in a project

00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:03,690
and so we have a number of measures Pony

00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:08,329
factor is one of them that I look at

00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:11,190
closely because there's something that

00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,320
you know if a project is active and it's

00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,940
vibrant and it's making releases and

00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,769
there are plenty of people who care

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,050
about it that's great that's what you

00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:20,880
want in a project but if we let a

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:23,759
project appear to be active you know

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:26,100
they have an active website they still

00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,779
have software for download then people

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,680
assume that it's going to be active and

00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,899
you know that's at worst are at best is

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,040
false advertising it worst it's it's

00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:41,100
irresponsible behavior and so the asf

00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,529
has a process called putting a project

00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,449
in the Attic that essentially deprecates

00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,709
that and kind of says you know there's

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,899
nothing inherently wrong with the

00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,810
software just nobody paying attention

00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:53,790
anymore so you know take that make that

00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,990
part of your judgment whether you use it

00:13:53,790 --> 00:14:00,990
or not so pony factor haven't told you

00:13:57,990 --> 00:14:03,510
really what it is so we look at source

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,630
code and and a lot of projects you know

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,610
if you look at the Apache web server

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:11,370
source code tree it goes back about 20

00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:13,110
years at this point now actually a

00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:17,790
little further 20 years since the Apache

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:20,250
group began working on it a lot of that

00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:21,690
history is is well and good but we want

00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,569
to look and see if it's being actively

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:28,769
maintained so we're taking a two-year

00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:30,839
chunk of time and we're saying first of

00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:34,829
all how much is happening in that

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:38,190
two-year chunk of time and who is who's

00:14:34,829 --> 00:14:39,750
actually working on it and when we start

00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,939
looking at the list of authors we try

00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:44,519
and figure out what is the smallest

00:14:41,939 --> 00:14:48,089
number of people that have written more

00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:51,000
than fifty percent of the code base and

00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:54,810
so that's Pony factor so we did this

00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,240
with Apache projects right and I'm I'm

00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:00,600
thrilled to death that project that I've

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,220
worked heavily on cloudstack it has 17

00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,720
people who've written fifty percent of

00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:06,620
the codebase that's the smallest number

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:11,610
you can you can get hit fifty percent

00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:14,670
Hadoop has 13 the Apache web server nine

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:17,279
subversion which I find interesting had

00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:19,079
seven people in the past couple of years

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,420
who've written more than fifty percent

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:26,459
of the code base so this is interesting

00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,260
and you know obviously this isn't all of

00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:30,870
the Apache projects and we have a number

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:35,760
of projects that are getting down below

00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:38,760
that four three two type of number and

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,620
are cause for concern but then we said

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,329
you know how do we compare with the rest

00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:47,360
of the world maybe apache is is doing

00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:50,279
better or doing worse but how do we know

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,310
so we went and looked at a number of

00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:58,490
other projects so of linux is and that's

00:15:55,310 --> 00:16:02,550
completely off the linux is at eleven

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:04,980
which you can't see i don't know why the

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:09,959
numbers are cut off there anyway linux

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:12,450
is at eleven you have ruby on rails at

00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:13,980
at seven but you also have a lot of

00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:18,060
projects on the opposite end of the

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:20,850
scale so get arguably the most popular

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,230
version control system today one person

00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:26,160
has written fifty percent or more of the

00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:29,640
code in the past two years compare that

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:34,140
just for a second with subversion seven

00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:41,180
people something something uh feels a

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:47,040
Miss there but engine X also one person

00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:50,880
node has to a lot of lot of interesting

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,620
things VLC has three people that are

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,910
writing fifty percent of the code or

00:16:52,620 --> 00:17:00,540
more so you know there are problems

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:02,790
everywhere and it's it's in places you

00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,770
wouldn't expect yeah right who would

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:10,490
expect that one person would be writing

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:10,490
more than fifty percent of get yes

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,819
commit logs because you can

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,839
by how far to go back so we're looking

00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:24,630
at lime count with a commit range of two

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,699
years back i actually have detailed map

00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:28,890
on that if you feel really interested in

00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:32,909
it there's actually a great graphical

00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:34,230
representation of that which is so the

00:17:32,909 --> 00:17:37,980
person who actually came up with pony

00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:39,630
factor his name is daniel grunow and you

00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:45,659
can follow him on twitter at humber

00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:48,450
dough which is H um b.ed o.o.h and his

00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:50,610
uh his twitter avatar is a stuffed pony

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:54,000
so you can kind of see where this came

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,880
from a couple of interesting other

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,590
interesting things openssl was listed at

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,370
two people having written fifty percent

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:06,780
of the code and we ran this in spring of

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:09,390
2015 the other interesting to me is

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:11,750
pearl pearl currently has three people

00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:14,400
who've written fifty percent of the code

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:17,100
there's a lot of pro code still running

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:27,500
and three people maintaining the

00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:27,500
languages at least concerning right so

00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:35,580
this is this is brief overview of how we

00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:39,860
were evaluating Pony factor so we

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:42,840
continue our farmyard animal series

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:44,309
Commons tragedy of the Commons is an

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,360
economic principle that really came

00:18:44,309 --> 00:18:52,169
about in 1968 but originally an English

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,350
economist William Lloyd wrote about the

00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:57,720
tragedy of the Commons in 1833 and the

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:00,330
commons were a common grazing area

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,890
available to everyone so it wasn't

00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:04,260
anyone's property you could bring your

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:08,750
animals there and graze in England and

00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,650
people did so and he saw a problem

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,650
specifically the problem that he was

00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,929
seeing were that people were were

00:19:13,650 --> 00:19:17,789
essentially grazing it bare and they

00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:20,820
would bring their sheep in their goats

00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:24,480
and cows and they would graze the entire

00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:27,000
place bear and leave nothing for anyone

00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,100
else which is part of a problem but also

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,380
it would destroy the environment for

00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,050
them

00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:38,880
for the future instead of using it

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:42,150
responsibly in 1968 Garrett Hardin a

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:45,850
ecologist why I can talk an ecologist

00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:48,670
wrote about the tragedy of the Commons

00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:50,860
building on that and essentially it's a

00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,070
situation where individuals acting

00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:58,180
independently and rationally for their

00:19:54,070 --> 00:20:01,360
own self-interest behave contrary to the

00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:03,940
best interest of a group by depleting a

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:09,580
common resource and ultimately acting in

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:12,010
contrary to their own best interest this

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:15,370
this kind of struck home with me but

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,350
it's not a perfect analogy right so the

00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,020
commons there's only a limited amount of

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:21,880
land and a limited amount of grass

00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:25,180
whereas we can duplicate software really

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,210
easily copying bits is essentially a

00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:32,590
zero cost function but developing and

00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:35,590
maintaining is not and so there's a lot

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,210
of this there are a lot of similarities

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:41,470
but there's also some places where it

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:43,540
breaks down and at the same time I think

00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,600
Wow open source has come a long way when

00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:48,880
I started an open-source you know there

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,910
was a lot of resistance especially from

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,030
businesses no one wanted that free

00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:57,910
software hippie software in their in

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:04,080
their data center and you know we've

00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:07,690
come really a long way just to you know

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:13,000
Mark andreasen is a venture capitalist

00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:14,560
he runs a VC firm in the Bay Area and in

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,540
the Wall Street Journal he wrote he

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,950
wrote an article there and one of the

00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,260
quotes out of that was software is

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,390
eating the world and we have places

00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,640
where we're replacing hardware with

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:27,640
software we're replacing what used to be

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,830
a human only function with software and

00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:35,800
really software is not just changing but

00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:37,690
consuming the world open source has

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,030
become the de facto you are not going to

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:42,160
deploy a new technology that is not

00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:43,480
going to be open source you want to do

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:46,480
containers

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,309
every container technology of note is

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,919
open-source you want to do cluster

00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:54,500
management that's started out as

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,350
open-source you want to do big data all

00:21:54,500 --> 00:22:00,980
the defective software packages you

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,630
would use our open source basically any

00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,690
new technology that's coming out there

00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:09,620
is written is assumed to be open source

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,909
I was in Tokyo last week and had dinner

00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,929
with gems Emlyn who's the executive

00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:16,520
director of the Linux Foundation and he

00:22:14,929 --> 00:22:19,010
told me about his experience with the

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:20,779
node folks they said you know they don't

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:22,940
remember all of the open source

00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:26,929
struggles they don't remember the

00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:30,700
reasons for rms being so insistent on

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:33,350
copyleft they don't remember all of the

00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:38,090
pushback we had from businesses who were

00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:40,820
so scared about liability they assumed

00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,200
that sharing is by default and they

00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:45,080
assume that people will just share back

00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:48,289
with them and that has become or better

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,240
or worse what we assume we have open

00:22:48,289 --> 00:22:52,190
source has really changed the tech

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,610
industry and certainly the software

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:59,630
world one of my favorite quotes that

00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:02,840
builds on the earlier one is from

00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:04,220
Ibrahim Haddad and he said it's not just

00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,289
software that's eating the world it's

00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:11,000
open source software that's eating the

00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:14,000
world even him works at Samsung now and

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,029
he went on to say you can't build a

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:21,590
product today without open source if you

00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:24,529
go buy a TV or a camera or a cellular

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,850
phone or even a refrigerator there is

00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:32,539
open source in it and you know it is the

00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:34,100
foundational level of so much that we so

00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:37,820
much that we buy now even when we're not

00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:40,250
buying software and it makes sense right

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:42,880
why would you go and invest the time to

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:45,820
build all of that foundational

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,279
infrastructure turning a TV on

00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:51,440
essentially booting a TV why would you

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,940
go do that with a proprietary operating

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,919
system you're going to have to build and

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:57,170
maintain why not build the top what

00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:59,300
other people are doing so it makes

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:06,550
perfect sense that you would build that

00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:09,080
on open source but so much of the time

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,570
we're focusing on building new

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:15,950
functionality and we're focusing on

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:18,740
building new features into software

00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:25,100
we're not focusing on maintenance so I'd

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:31,610
like to offer some contrast let's take

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:34,970
Google web fonts anyone using Google web

00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:36,140
fonts for stuff okay if you're doing

00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:40,040
anything on the web you're using google

00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,580
web fonts and don't know it they are

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:46,490
pervasive at this point and and widely

00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:52,400
used an S great resource right Google's

00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:54,620
providing freely licensed thoughts but

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,980
in the past year google has dedicated

00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:02,720
more developer time to optimizing font

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:06,230
sizes font colors icon shapes and other

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,590
trivial visual details especially for

00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:11,480
their ads and applications that openssl

00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:23,180
developers have spent over the lifetime

00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:24,500
of their project it's not right we focus

00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:28,070
on the things that we think are

00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:35,110
important and apparently thoughts and

00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:35,110
colors are more important so RVs right

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:43,850
arby's has a dedicated website team

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:45,470
right and they sell basically one type

00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:47,150
of sandwich you can get different

00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,410
toppings and stuff like that they sell

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:53,530
one type of sandwich and they need a

00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:56,930
website to advertise that apparently so

00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:59,750
it's that website is staffed by a team

00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:03,350
of well pay professionals who do that

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,500
only the website is their day job in a

00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:09,950
week the arbys website team has more

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,700
developer resources that openssl does

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,760
any

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,770
year because obviously we care about

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,090
selling sandwiches more than we care

00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:19,090
about securing traffic on the Internet

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:34,250
Joe Joe has pointed out that i do not

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:36,050
want the Arby's website team responsible

00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,030
for the security of all the internet and

00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:40,300
that is probably a fair statement

00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:43,150
however I would happily take the dollars

00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:47,260
allocated to the website team and

00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:51,380
allocate that to openssl or our bash or

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:53,390
canoe PG for that matter and that's

00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:56,090
really what it is it's not you know i'm

00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:58,250
not saying hey those website developers

00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:59,420
are doing terrible things because why

00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,320
aren't they doing open source instead

00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:06,230
you know we all have jobs to do and and

00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,450
have to make money to live so I'm not

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,400
vilifying them in any way but when I

00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,220
think about arby's as a company or

00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:18,440
Google as a company that depends upon

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:21,920
this core infrastructure you know it's

00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,040
hard to rationalize a choice like the

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:31,280
resources tossed behind Google web fonts

00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:36,170
compared to what Stas behind openssl so

00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:41,270
I want to toss out a couple of ideas the

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:42,410
first is that it is radically easy to

00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:46,640
become part of a critical software

00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:48,640
project for a lot of them there just

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,950
aren't many people even paying attention

00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:56,330
so another person showing up that's a

00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:58,610
big deal you know yes there are projects

00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:00,860
like Linux that have thousands of

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:03,080
contributors there are projects like

00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:06,370
OpenStack that have hundreds or

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:08,630
bordering on thousands of contributors

00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:10,130
yes you can get involved there and it's

00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:12,860
probably even easier for you to get

00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:16,100
involved there because lots of lots of

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,380
hype around both of them but you could

00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:19,730
also go and get involved with bash or

00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,840
you could go and get involved with

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:24,650
openssl or help out canoe PG and even as

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,140
a volunteer

00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:31,100
have a huge impact on that project and

00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:33,380
also a huge impact because those are

00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:35,270
critical software projects and there are

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:40,100
scores of them you know I called out

00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:42,050
three examples one of the one of the

00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:44,870
researchers I think this was David

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:48,730
wheeler dr. David wheeler who does a lot

00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:53,120
of military research around open source

00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:56,860
and I think he said that it's not a

00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,050
question of you know how did this happen

00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,850
but with the number of people paying

00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:05,600
attention it's a question of why is it's

00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:07,790
not happening more frequently so I I

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,460
think I think the first thing I would

00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:12,740
say is find an open source project that

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,320
you can help if we took more

00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,360
responsibility for the awesome ecosystem

00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,760
of software that open source is made

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,690
available to us maybe we wouldn't be

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,790
having these kind of problems I'll bring

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,160
up the common infrastructure initiative

00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:30,340
this is something that the Linux

00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Foundation started after heartbleed and

00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:38,270
essentially it's a pool of money that

00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:41,360
companies contribute to and then they go

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:45,710
and look for things like openssl renew

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,300
PG and they say hey let's fund some

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:49,550
people to work on this full time or

00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:52,640
let's audit all of this software and pay

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,950
a professional auditing company to go

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,380
through and do a security audit now I

00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:00,170
think that's interesting if you work for

00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,320
a company that's large enough to

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:08,050
participate in that your company should

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:10,700
I think there are currently 24 members

00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:13,550
who are part of common infrastructure

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,470
initiative but there should be more and

00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:20,810
really any company of any size should be

00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:23,660
ponying up for that and but here's

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,750
something I think if you can't get your

00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:29,720
company to toss money into common

00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:31,160
infrastructure initiative and you're not

00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,540
going to go do it yourself you're not

00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,640
going to go get involved in a project

00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:38,390
make the case that your company should

00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:40,870
invest and I think there's two ways

00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:43,700
you can invest I think the first is that

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:45,590
you could pay a vendor and you could pay

00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:50,690
a vendor that does a good job of up

00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:52,310
streaming and you know yes vendors are

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:55,700
there to make money and open source

00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:58,730
we've gone we have this expectation that

00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:00,380
the software itself will be free but a

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:03,740
number of vendors do a good job of up

00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:09,620
streaming work redhats probably the

00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:14,720
poster boy for if anyone hasn't noticed

00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:16,070
Joe works for Red Hat but you know Red

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,900
Hat does a good job of not just

00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:21,820
investing in the technologies they sell

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:24,800
but investing in the ecosystem around it

00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:28,340
you know there are plenty of vendors

00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:32,990
like that you know pick one that's this

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:38,240
actively contributing there is a there

00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:43,520
is a large company in Northwest who

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:45,830
sells cloud services and for the longest

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,980
time my complaint with them was your

00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:51,230
building on open source and you're

00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,750
virtually invisible in the open source

00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:55,670
ecosystem you're not contributing back

00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:59,390
and helping ensure that that thing that

00:31:55,670 --> 00:32:01,370
makes your service possible continues to

00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:02,990
function that started to improve and

00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:06,590
that's right why I'm not calling out a

00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:08,840
name but and they're starting to cycle

00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:11,480
back but if you're using a vendor and

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:12,710
that vendor is building all of their

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,920
stuff on open source and they're not

00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:17,030
contributing code back in the process

00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,510
that should be a huge warning flag

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:22,100
that's an active threat to your business

00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:24,920
quite honestly all of this is an active

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:27,290
threat to your business right you know

00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,870
you wouldn't you wouldn't go buy a

00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:32,120
building or take a building for free and

00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:38,840
then never maintain it for 20 or 30

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:40,820
years would you have your employer allow

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,680
you to contribute upstream and this is a

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:47,510
big hurdle for folks but most people are

00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:50,060
I find even the stocks admins are

00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:51,110
patching stuff locally to scratch their

00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,960
own itch

00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:55,130
they could be contributing that upstream

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,929
much less if they were actually having

00:32:55,130 --> 00:33:02,900
to do any real development you know get

00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:04,640
some of that twenty percent time talk

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,920
them into that make them understand the

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,120
value proposition that really what

00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:11,660
you're doing is you're doing that

00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,010
maintenance the ongoing maintenance one

00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:17,150
of the interesting things that I found

00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:18,980
was when looking at openssl is that lots

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,990
of people were funding developers to

00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:25,640
work on new functionality in openssl

00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:31,130
they were adding new features they were

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:33,559
adding new new content and new

00:33:31,130 --> 00:33:34,970
encryption types to openssl but they

00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:36,770
weren't actually keeping up with the

00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:39,350
ongoing maintenance no one was going

00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:41,960
cleaning up code or anything of that

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:46,760
nature and no one certainly no one was

00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:49,760
paying for it so I think it's important

00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,429
that we look at this from a maintenance

00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,760
perspective not hey I've got to go fix a

00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:58,549
bug that's really annoying me and I'm

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,809
going to fix that one bug and stop you

00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:03,200
know there needs to be some long-term

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:06,049
dedication to things that matter to us

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,419
as individuals and to businesses and I

00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:10,040
think businesses make the most sense

00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:15,440
because they have the most to lose out

00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,909
of it and so I want to have your

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,359
questions your comments and your flames

00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:38,190
right now tell me where I'm wrong and

00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:40,440
I'm not going to pick you yes sir so

00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:42,119
tell you about a couple google Summer of

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,089
Code does a good job with individual

00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,520
students there are a couple of other

00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:51,980
interesting programs out there one of

00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:56,250
them is outreach II they're targeting

00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:58,160
largely females and they're going to

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:02,849
start targeting other underrepresented

00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:11,490
classes those two are the immediate ones

00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:18,420
that jump to mind there's Posse POS SI e

00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:22,940
which is what's Posse stand for anyway

00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:26,670
it's essentially educating cops I

00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,990
professors in open source practices so

00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:32,310
that they can then go bring their

00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:36,599
students doing like a capstone project

00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:41,520
in open source and but that's focused on

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:44,160
on the instructors themselves ah if

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,990
there's a there's guy out here I think

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,599
he's wearing a blue shirt he's sitting

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:50,910
in front of the 3d printer his name spot

00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:53,339
Callaway you should talk to him because

00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:57,180
he's focusing on trying to get open

00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:58,290
source into universities and he's doing

00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,270
that with a number of other folks but

00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:04,500
he's the only person i know that's here

00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:06,420
that's focused on it so there are some

00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:12,869
of those initiatives but the cost is

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:15,960
very high for that so about five years

00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:19,890
ago maybe six years ago I worked with I

00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:21,780
worked with a group at RIT Rochester

00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:24,510
Institute of Technology and we brought

00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:27,599
one of their classes on board to work in

00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:29,970
the Fedora project and we essentially

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,740
had them for a semester and we spent a

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,410
lot of that semester ramping them up

00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,440
because comp side generally doesn't

00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:40,079
teach how to use version control the

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,829
concept of mailing list especially on

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:49,140
you know 19 20 21 22 year olds is a

00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:51,930
foreign thing so is IRC so acclimating

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,640
them the cost is very high and the

00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:56,250
then you know typically they're gone in

00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,770
the semester ideally you'll get a few

00:36:56,250 --> 00:37:02,640
people who will stick around and we'll

00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:05,880
continue contributing but you know the

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,550
cost to do that is pretty high not

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,460
saying it's a bad idea just understand

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:15,180
the costs involved and really without a

00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:19,320
really engaged professor who understands

00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,660
it has been through the process I'm

00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,980
almost pessimistic enough to say that

00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:57,750
the cost is too high without that

00:37:22,980 --> 00:38:00,750
heavily involved prof yes sir so this

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,980
gentleman was talking about university

00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:05,330
system in South Carolina and

00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:07,650
specifically Clemson being tasked to

00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:11,340
provide support for all of the Medicaid

00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:13,740
servers in the state and how that as a

00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:15,480
part of that they were contributing back

00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:19,500
to open source and specifically Dassault

00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,510
both paying a vendor and getting code

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:23,960
back upstream as well yes sir in the

00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,960
back of the room

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:46,830
you

00:39:28,589 --> 00:39:34,380
so and i'll repeat real quickly if you

00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:39,609
want to hand the mic to the next person

00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:43,049
he was saying that really the only the

00:39:39,609 --> 00:39:46,150
only contribution back is when

00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:48,880
universities are having side projects so

00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:53,130
he specifically cited Indiana University

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,450
and their cybersecurity research group

00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:59,470
and you know they're getting in grant

00:39:55,450 --> 00:40:02,500
money from NHS and NSF to do various

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:05,380
types of work and and are able to do

00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:11,309
some of that right but it's it's

00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:11,309
directly funded yeah yes sir

00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:25,420
with the small size of these these the

00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,370
number of contributors to these large

00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:30,520
projects these very important projects

00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,440
I've worked with development teams I'm

00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:36,820
not a developer but I've worked with

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,160
them and on for companies and usually

00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,230
there's a QA department I don't see how

00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,280
with one developer you can have a

00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:47,440
separate person doing QA and so that

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,990
means that this stuff isn't isn't really

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,330
being tested and I've heard that you

00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:54,970
know that we rely on millions of eyes

00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:56,320
looking at the source code but it

00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:58,390
doesn't really look like anyone's

00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:03,040
looking at it or at least not very many

00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:05,410
people are looking at it so uh how do

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,540
you address that because when you make

00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:10,030
changes to stuff that people are

00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:12,970
depending on all over the world and it

00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:20,610
really hasn't had anyone banging on it

00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:24,010
to see well what could yeah so

00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:26,440
specifically that that problem is so

00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:29,800
first of all lanús is law right with

00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:33,010
enough with enough eyes any problem is

00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:35,380
shallow right any bug is shallow and

00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:36,550
that's true but as you pointed out a lot

00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,470
of these projects with one or two

00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:41,880
developers they don't have enough eyes

00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:45,130
to even do basic code review much less

00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:49,720
much less you know doing any kind of QA

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:52,360
or serious testing out of out of heart

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,060
bleed a lot of the commentary that was

00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:57,280
done a lot of the research that was done

00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:59,890
there's a paper actually entitled how we

00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,870
prevent the next heartbleed and it says

00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:04,660
you know if we had a basic test suite

00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:10,030
that did you know just stupid things

00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:12,760
that you know push invalid push invalid

00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,330
feeds to these libraries and see what

00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:19,180
happens we would have found this problem

00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:21,070
and you know why did we not have a test

00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:23,710
suite that a developer could run against

00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:27,300
it as opposed to you know committing

00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:31,270
code compiling shipping and done with it

00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:35,590
it's a very real problem it's it's

00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:41,650
you know we depend upon a lot of these

00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:45,320
very esoteric sometimes but very common

00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:48,620
libraries and software packages and

00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:50,480
there aren't enough people with eyes on

00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:53,330
it and not enough people paying

00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:57,770
attention I think it's the biggest

00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:59,510
threat to open source is that we're

00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:01,520
going to develop a reputation for having

00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:07,370
things like heartbleed and shell shock

00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:09,470
and that because no one is quote/unquote

00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,780
paying attention we suddenly go from

00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:15,470
this reputation for having very robust

00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:19,340
peer-reviewed software to that's not

00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,810
really different than paying my paying a

00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,370
developer in-house to write something

00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:24,320
and never letting anybody look at it

00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:26,330
before we press it into production which

00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:28,250
no business would do right no same

00:43:26,330 --> 00:43:31,160
business would would take something and

00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:35,830
inject it into something that's

00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,830
important to the business yes ma'am

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,960
check okay um I'm wondering if a little

00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,910
bit of it is also sort of cultural so

00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:00,550
when you share the statistics on how

00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:04,300
many developers had pushed up patches I

00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:07,630
I don't know if there was a way to look

00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:10,120
at who did review of patches alongside

00:44:07,630 --> 00:44:12,910
that and so many of the tools that we

00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,970
choose to use and be like oh here's our

00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:17,350
star contributor Dave nalli who's put in

00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:20,410
like ten thousand lines of code this

00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:21,760
year he's awesome and then it's like who

00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,990
reviewed all that code and it's like oh

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,580
I don't know we don't have a way to

00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:28,120
check that someone must have I'm sure

00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,950
and so we don't also put like and thank

00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:31,690
god Joe brockmeier looked at all that

00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,600
code because like otherwise it would

00:44:31,690 --> 00:44:36,910
have been on holy nightmare so we

00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,980
culturally sort of reward just lines of

00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:40,900
code and we never do the thing where

00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,540
we're like hey could review that was

00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:46,090
also awesome or we rarely do it I've

00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:48,010
seen it maybe once out in a wild the

00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:51,760
twisted project was having that problem

00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:53,890
where they were getting lots of patches

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,690
submitted and and new contributors that

00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:57,400
were really excited and then no one

00:44:55,690 --> 00:44:59,440
would review it because they weren't

00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,130
getting any gold stars for doing it and

00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,340
so they game ified it like you got you

00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:09,190
know like 10,000 points for 3 code

00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:12,070
reviews and then like your lines of code

00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:14,320
you got less gold stars for and then all

00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:16,180
of a sudden everyone was like as soon as

00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:28,090
something came up for review people were

00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:30,280
fighting over it no so I think that's a

00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:32,200
good point because we have version

00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:36,790
control systems that's an easy way to

00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:39,010
look at who's committing code we have we

00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:42,520
have github pull requests we have a

00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:44,410
review board Garrett we have people who

00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,240
don't do code review through any of

00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:49,390
those tools so getting metrics on that's

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,250
a little more what's a difficult it's no

00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:53,650
more difficult than than anything else

00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:55,660
but it's it's more fractured and because

00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:58,150
it's more fractured we don't have a

00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:00,220
common interface for it we also don't

00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:02,360
have a good common interface for rating

00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:05,090
the quality either of lines of code

00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:08,560
mitted are of raiding the quality of

00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:14,120
reviews and and that's also problem and

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:17,300
you know pony factor is is a great great

00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:19,370
back of the napkin health check it

00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:22,550
shouldn't be the only one there are

00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:23,900
projects there are projects in there

00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:26,720
that have that look like they have a

00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:29,690
great help statistic that I wouldn't

00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:36,310
necessarily trust Joe do you want to say

00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:36,310
something now I assume so

00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,310
yeah I'll go back and I'll say something

00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:23,740
else I don't think that it's just

00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:25,420
developers I do not think developers

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,780
developers developers should be our

00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:33,849
mantra and someone's already taken it

00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:37,000
anyway right um but I think open source

00:47:33,849 --> 00:47:39,820
projects deeply need someone who cares

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:43,300
and it may not be writing code it may

00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:46,200
not be triaging bugs it may not be doing

00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:50,040
code review but a lot of these projects

00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:52,540
desperately need someone who cares and

00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:56,740
you would be surprised at the difference

00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:58,329
that can make them even if it's i'm

00:47:56,740 --> 00:48:01,839
going to write a blog post about how to

00:47:58,329 --> 00:48:03,700
use whatever package that's probably

00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:05,290
more public exposure than a lot of these

00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:09,490
projects that aren't in the hype cycle

00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:11,670
have gotten in years and is well worth

00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:11,670
the investment

00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,550
you

00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:25,270
so I'm down to five minutes I'm going to

00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:31,780
take this gentleman's question real

00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:37,890
quickly and hang on one second hey hang

00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:40,450
on one second so so a lot of the

00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:47,170
previous question and comments were

00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:48,910
around school systems are are not open

00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:51,490
sourced friendly and so we end up with

00:51:48,910 --> 00:51:54,069
an education system that tends to not be

00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:55,720
open source friendly which inhibits a

00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:58,240
lot of what we want to try and achieve

00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:59,829
an open source and there was some

00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:03,430
discussion back and forth in the room

00:51:59,829 --> 00:52:05,349
about you know taking matching donations

00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:07,390
from employers and funneling that into

00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:12,010
open source getting involved with the in

00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:15,810
the local school system to start some of

00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:15,810
those changes and yes sir

00:52:17,609 --> 00:52:19,670
you

00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:51,460
so and the final comment there was that

00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,620
the school system has a limited budget

00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:56,440
and they get contract deals with

00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:58,870
companies like Dell or Microsoft wherein

00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:01,090
they can buy 20 computers at a discount

00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:02,920
but they have to run Windows they are

00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:05,980
limited in the application suites if

00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:08,530
they can install thereafter by the terms

00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:09,970
of that contract anyway folks I will be

00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:12,220
here the rest of the weekend feel free

00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:14,830
to come talk to me or harass me via

00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:17,340
email or Twitter thanks very much for

00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,340
coming and staying

00:53:43,990 --> 00:53:46,050
you

00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:55,980
your customers rely on your website or

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,320
application if it's slower

00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,290
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:03,090
and costs you money keeping your

00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:06,580
business critical systems humming along

00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:08,920
requires insight into what they're doing

00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:10,870
your system metrics tells stories

00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,910
stories that can reveal performance

00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:15,220
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:16,780
other problems but how do you keep an

00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:19,420
eye on all of your systems performance

00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:22,450
metrics in real-time and record this

00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:24,220
data for leader analysis enter long view

00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:26,230
the new way to see what's really going

00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,420
on under the hood the long view

00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:30,430
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:32,890
of all your systems providing you with a

00:54:30,430 --> 00:54:36,250
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:38,830
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:40,570
load and network usage click a specific

00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:42,970
system to access its individual

00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:45,480
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:47,890
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:49,450
comprehensive network data including

00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:51,790
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:54:49,450 --> 00:54:53,440
available on the network tab and disk

00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:55,360
rights and free space on the disk

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,240
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:54:55,360 --> 00:55:00,790
displays usage statistics for individual

00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:02,980
processes the system info tab shows

00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:05,200
listening services active connections

00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:07,300
and available updates adding long view

00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,980
to a system is easy just click the

00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,140
button copy the one line installation

00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:13,630
command then run the command on your

00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:15,310
linux system to complete the process the

00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:17,530
agent will begin collecting data and

00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:19,380
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:21,960
start rolling

00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:24,390
use longview to gain visibility into

00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:28,160
your servers so when your website or app

00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:28,160
heats up it stays up

00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:49,580
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,580
you need to integrate manage and

00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:54,620
automate a virtual data center all on an

00:56:52,580 --> 00:56:57,050
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:59,780
platform and at a third of the cost of

00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:01,520
other solutions but why even bother with

00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:03,650
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:05,600
in the first place well let's say you

00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:08,000
have a traditional one server to one

00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,070
application architecture but you're

00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:12,620
running out of resources and performance

00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:14,950
is suffering once you order new server

00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:17,840
hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:20,720
configure it install your business

00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:23,510
application stage and test the server

00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:25,640
and finally add it to your production

00:57:23,510 --> 00:57:27,830
farm if you've been through this process

00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:30,350
before you know it can take weeks or

00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:32,210
even months you also know it's a

00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:34,160
manually intensive process that will

00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:37,220
burden your team every time you outgrow

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,200
your current setup with the virtual

00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:42,200
server solution you could accomplish all

00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:44,720
of that in less than half a day server

00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:46,550
virtualization software separates the OS

00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:48,980
and application from the underlying

00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:51,020
server hardware and with multiple

00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:52,760
virtual machines on a single server you

00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,850
can use each of them to run different

00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:57,530
os's and applications this makes it

00:57:55,850 --> 00:57:59,270
possible to move your virtual machines

00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:01,340
from one piece of hardware to another

00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:03,650
whenever you want to maximize

00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:05,690
utilization simplify maintenance or

00:58:03,650 --> 00:58:07,850
recover from a hardware failure and

00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:10,790
without slowing down your applications

00:58:07,850 --> 00:58:13,940
or users clearly server virtualization

00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:16,940
provides big benefits and Citrix

00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:19,190
XenServer provides even more since it's

00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:20,960
built on an open platform send server

00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:23,240
plays well with your existing hardware

00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,490
storage systems and IT management

00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,280
software as well as with the industry's

00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:30,200
