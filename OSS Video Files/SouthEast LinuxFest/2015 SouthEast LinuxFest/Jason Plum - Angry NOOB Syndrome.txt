okay all right everyone i'll go ahead

00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,980
and get started and set his Marlon we

00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,130
still got a couple triggers in but I'm

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:26,040
go ahead and say hi and you guys hear me

00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:33,370
clearly the better yeah it's not is it

00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:41,019
sounds fine in my head it's green what I

00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:48,839
gotta yell on it what that was fine okay

00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:48,839
good all right little technical problem

00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,659
all right everybody I thank you for

00:00:53,499 --> 00:00:57,640
coming out I know that I'm in line with

00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:00,159
the keynote for the day so I do

00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,079
appreciate everybody that's come for a

00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:03,429
little tiny bit of background for

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,880
everybody who may not necessarily know

00:01:03,429 --> 00:01:09,100
me or where I come from a little under

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,799
five years ago I was a top-level windows

00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:15,130
system admin I was the top of the tier

00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,560
when it comes to engineering and left my

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:20,880
windows job as VP of a technical

00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,920
operations at a medical billing company

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,740
what I ended up doing was transiting

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,630
what knowledge I knew into learning

00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:31,539
about linux and deep diving and really

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,490
getting to understand it and now i am a

00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:35,859
core developer with arch linux arm and

00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:37,390
for my day job i'm actually employed as

00:01:35,859 --> 00:01:40,479
a distribution manager and senior

00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,280
software engineer with Devin IT so I

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,969
have a little bit of experience with the

00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,429
topics i'm going to cover today so the

00:01:45,969 --> 00:01:51,609
question would be what is hungry noob

00:01:48,429 --> 00:01:53,469
syndrome so angry noob syndrome is

00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:55,960
something that I've seen or what I'm

00:01:53,469 --> 00:01:57,609
decided to call it as a topic of

00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,850
conversation that I had with a fellow

00:01:57,609 --> 00:02:02,320
friend and what we have is we have

00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:04,810
people that come into our communities

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,479
they may not be familiar they may not be

00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:09,009
very well informed but they're angry

00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:10,899
because they're not being treated with

00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:13,840
respect or they're being completely

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:14,100
ignored okay this is not something that

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,250
we

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,560
actually do as a community as a project

00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,660
whether it's in phos in linux bsd or

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,490
anything that you're trying to do right

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,500
because when they come in and they're

00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,540
angry whether they're yelling at you or

00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,060
you are mistreating them the only thing

00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,500
you end up doing is actually harming the

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,920
community that you're attempting to be

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,920
beneficial to so we have many things

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,710
this can actually mean it can be your

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,200
community actually has an S or a person

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:46,170
in your community has a ms all right

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,870
this can be many things but in the end

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,970
we all know that is a very bad thing so

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,440
let's talk about a couple things that

00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:55,650
are there and how we can actually

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,350
address them moving forward a couple of

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:01,680
symptoms right frequent regurgitation of

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,690
flood Oh has ever been in one of those

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,500
chat rooms or one of those mailing list

00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:10,020
or at that conversation right

00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,060
everybody's happy somebody says

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,160
something you know it was a little bit

00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,690
of snark but then some guy who doesn't

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:20,910
know takes as fact and then gets fanatic

00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,610
about it and just start spewing into

00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:26,610
people right this is not a healthy

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:27,930
behavior when you come into a community

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,670
and you're asking question you're

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,470
genuinely interested or you're just

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,940
inquiring about something to see if you

00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:37,020
actually have a deep of interest on it

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,310
and you yell at them or someone does

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,860
because they're not making the same

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:44,220
decision or they're not knowing as much

00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,840
about the project or Linux in general or

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,840
free and open source software and how it

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:51,120
might work this is not healthy behavior

00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,800
you are creating an angry new because

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,990
you're going to incite anger him because

00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,150
the first thing he gets on is a simple

00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:01,050
question that may be uninformed and

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:02,790
you're insulting for no reason then we

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,400
have of course the intensive and elitist

00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:08,400
behavior we've all seen this in all of

00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,520
our distributions we know arch has its

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,430
issues with its public disability so

00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:18,180
does gentoo so to slack so does anybody

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:21,390
okay but that behavior that's bad for

00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:23,760
everyone who is in your community you

00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,740
need to be aware of it and try to not do

00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,590
it yourself unless you're in a community

00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,010
and a tight-knit

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:33,100
members that you know already know that

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,540
what you're saying is snark okay because

00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,610
if somebody comes in they're walking off

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,060
the street you hear something in passing

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,919
in any restaurant and gone what them

00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:43,360
that is exactly what somebody walking in

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,320
your community is going to get what

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,919
they're going to say what they're gonna

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,889
think and if they know nothing about it

00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,820
snap judgments happen all right and then

00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:55,900
we have the entitled and petulant Maggie

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:59,380
this is kind of a societal problem

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:01,120
outside of phos but if you're not

00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:03,880
supporting my project and you come in

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,560
and you yell at me because I'm not doing

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,450
whatever thing and you're accelerated

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,070
graphics on your brand new nvidia isn't

00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,400
working perfectly because it's got some

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,770
glitch seriously you're not making me

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,430
want to help you but i know it's my job

00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:21,600
to actually attend to help you so coming

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:26,470
at me angrily isn't doing anybody good

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,110
so let's get right into that fear

00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,700
uncertainty and doubt let's try and not

00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:33,460
in sight these things let's be accurate

00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,560
in the things we say because we really

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,810
need to know what we're going to have an

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,580
argument or a discussion actually about

00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:41,530
and I'm saying really understand your

00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,490
talking points if you're going to get

00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,510
into why gen 2 is better than a bow to

00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:48,760
then you need to know everything about

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,979
why jens who is actually better than

00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:53,139
abou two for that person's use case or

00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:56,530
your own use case if you've never used

00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,419
it and you're just some guy what are you

00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:01,500
doing you're literally thinking what

00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:05,349
you've read I'm spewing it that is but

00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,960
it's not helping anybody what about the

00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:11,200
the amount that we actually here we see

00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,349
we read when guys pushed randomly all

00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:17,860
over the Internet anybody seen down with

00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:21,400
systemd and that case I really do say

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,979
vomited onto the internet so let's cover

00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,500
a couple of these gentoo as a case right

00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:30,160
outside of gentoo and people who don't

00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,229
run systems that are highly tweaked and

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,539
I'm not saying it's a ricer distro here

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:37,930
it's very customizable so it's extremely

00:06:34,539 --> 00:06:39,869
usable I'm extremely targetable there

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,459
are more embedded systems

00:06:39,869 --> 00:06:45,159
applications running on gentoo than any

00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:47,619
other distribution in the world so

00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:51,029
before you say it's a ricer distro get

00:06:47,619 --> 00:06:54,580
your facts and I'm not a gentoo user

00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,869
pulseaudio right how many people say

00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,569
they've had problems with pulseaudio

00:06:55,869 --> 00:07:01,360
it's really annoying I really hate it

00:06:58,569 --> 00:07:06,399
I'll never use it again do me a favor

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,979
try it again it's a fuss project things

00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:12,369
have been fixed something's broke and

00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:14,889
they fixed it again it happens one bad

00:07:12,369 --> 00:07:16,479
experience does not mean that it's

00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:20,740
completely screwed for the rest of its

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,819
life Cindy I'm sorry that s really was

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,899
lower case it look it's Leonard again

00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:27,459
often the same people who were mad at

00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:30,519
pulseaudio because they had really bad

00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:32,469
problems when it was young system he's

00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:35,469
really not a big of an issue if you

00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:37,119
understand what it is how it works why

00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:41,889
it does it and you're not just reading

00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:45,219
but okay details are horribly important

00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:47,139
to make sure that this crap doesn't get

00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:51,309
spewed and regurgitated and regurgitated

00:07:47,139 --> 00:07:52,539
and continue the cycle wine we can all

00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:54,550
make that argument why am i running

00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:57,490
Windows applications on my free and open

00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,729
source software and there's use cases

00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,619
that's why the software exists there's

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,749
pluses there's minuses some of them are

00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:05,860
actually portable without line some of

00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:07,930
them you actually have to have extra

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:12,419
stacks from my google yours something

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,419
like that to get it to work well but oh

00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:18,969
yeah no there's just some of it that's

00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:20,860
using some hidden API Yeah right and at

00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:24,129
least someone tried to court the devil

00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,509
you know right and then we have all the

00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:27,459
stuff that has surrounded certain

00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:29,339
communities or outrages because people

00:08:27,459 --> 00:08:32,680
in pay attention to the details

00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,029
elementary OS some of you know what

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,439
happened with that some of you don't

00:08:34,029 --> 00:08:36,849
know what happened with that some people

00:08:35,439 --> 00:08:39,810
thought hey they're charging everybody

00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:42,159
know the look was just tiny little early

00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:44,740
because they were trying to get some

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,130
funding because people didn't look long

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,750
enough to see the details that crap

00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,540
happened and it became a shitstorm

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,560
across all of the internet and

00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:59,000
communities and people weren't outraged

00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,490
for no reason at all okay that took two

00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,440
three weeks to settle down and it should

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:06,110
not have ever taken more than a couple

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,570
of hours people don't regurgitate things

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:12,830
you haven't personally zaman check your

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,930
facts once we're pacified we have to

00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:16,580
worry about fanaticism and I bring it up

00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,250
second because foot can induce

00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:21,230
fanaticism that can be about hardware

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:25,100
all right I can be about Intel vs AMD

00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:28,310
Nvidia versus a TI samsung versus

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:32,120
anything the point is you can go left

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,620
and right with this one but again if you

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,080
haven't used it and all you're

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,610
regurgitating media and you don't

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,000
actually have any basis for either of

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,100
these things then what round do you have

00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,830
without having either at personal

00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,810
experience or actually done something

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,370
with it besides reading what the media

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:56,060
says anybody noticed marketing

00:09:49,370 --> 00:10:00,020
materialise anybody yeah systemd versus

00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:03,560
sits V versus and nine versus opener see

00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:05,390
does it really matter if you're using it

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:09,530
for your needs it meets your needs in

00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:11,990
the way and meet your needs use the one

00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,670
that you work for you that's one of the

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,910
beauties of working in the environment

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,580
that we work in there are options there

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,200
will continue to be options you don't

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,780
need a racist think about it make your

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,850
choice work with the please

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:27,800
networkmanager versus con men this is

00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,839
not so much of an issue these days but

00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:32,150
still people have this argument and I've

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,010
had to deal with this with people not

00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:36,140
understanding why network manager works

00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,510
this way but this one works this way and

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:40,490
people arguing why you should have one

00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:44,960
or the other don't ask me it's an arch

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:47,030
thing but then we have the distros right

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:49,130
you should be using a bow to or you

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,589
should be using vb Anor slackware or red

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:55,100
ever this doesn't happen as much in the

00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:56,630
circles that we are in but have you ever

00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,290
asked somebody who's interested in

00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:01,940
possibly trying Linux but they haven't

00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:03,649
yet because it can't get a straight

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,540
answer from anybody

00:11:03,649 --> 00:11:07,579
one guy will answer one way and the guy

00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:10,449
beside him launcher another way the guy

00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:14,059
beside him says no you're boasting wrong

00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:16,220
that's not helping you need to know what

00:11:14,059 --> 00:11:18,769
the person capable of you know what

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,509
they're capable of doing and what they

00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:22,399
know because you can't just take

00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,499
somebody who's used windows aid the last

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,240
five versions and go you're somewhere

00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:30,920
right in that case Abu two mins

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:32,959
elementary may actually be their best

00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,610
option but if they're a technical person

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,800
who knows the innards of hell windows

00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,230
behaves they may actually be able to go

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,720
yes I want a deep dive and actually go

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,670
to that you have to make educated

00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,149
decisions across all of these

00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:51,470
discussions that were having let's go

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:55,269
skip them so this fighting children

00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,920
right let's really not have this problem

00:11:55,269 --> 00:11:59,809
we have do we want to compile everything

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,309
ourselves do we want to package it if

00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:02,480
we're going to package it are we doing

00:12:01,309 --> 00:12:03,860
it the right way or dealing with

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,679
dependencies right you're not doing it

00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:08,300
your true simple you're too complex

00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,550
right there's a reason we have eight

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,600
package managers and we have two more

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:17,899
helming right and then there was do you

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,509
patch do pads at all how much do you

00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:22,550
patch who's doing the patching why did

00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:23,720
you patch so many things these are all

00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,240
discussions that happen but there

00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:29,059
between distros and inadvertently this

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,490
infighting becomes bud this Fudd because

00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:33,559
fanaticism and we feed the cycle all

00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,350
over again these are things we have

00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:39,529
really have to watch out for and we all

00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:40,910
do it I know I do I try to catch myself

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:42,980
and when I do say these things I make

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:45,379
sure I'm with people who understand what

00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:47,779
I'm saying at some background and that

00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:52,220
they know why what I'm saying probably

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:54,730
as a joke this is not what we want to

00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,499
look like anybody agree with that one

00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,360
right for mac and Windows users this is

00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:04,959
what we look like when we have an

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,959
argument that okay

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:15,350
so yeah it's a good square shot to the

00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:17,540
face might have some head trauma so the

00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:19,940
next thing after all this and what keeps

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,209
everything in check is definitively

00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:27,230
communication all right we've all seen

00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:29,810
things that blow up we've all been at

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,720
the other end of somebody blew up the

00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,279
question is when that person blew up

00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,399
we're the accurate in going after you

00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:41,149
did they have a reason and a right in

00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:43,070
the circle and respect to actually do

00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:45,199
that to you when Linus goes after

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,540
somebody all right these are guys that

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,459
are put in place their trusted their

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,260
expected this isn't some guy on his

00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,149
first patch killing your absolute crap

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,130
what the hell are you doing this is some

00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,769
guy who's trusted to maintain a stable

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,600
branch of the entire kernel or an entire

00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:02,329
subsystem he's been doing it for a

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,610
couple of years it's their job to get it

00:14:02,329 --> 00:14:08,720
right everyone expects them to get it

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:11,149
right you call them out if you don't

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,680
have that if you don't have that circle

00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:14,480
and you just go after somebody for

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,470
making a bad decision doing something

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:22,250
stupid or just not agreeing with you

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:24,949
yeah let's try not being the dick

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,690
because while you're making that

00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:29,110
argument with that person that's all

00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,180
they're thinking is that came to you

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:38,899
because you know and you just chewed

00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:41,300
them out without any valid reason so the

00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:44,600
thing you have to keep in mind is very

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,880
succinct how you treat your community is

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:51,500
an evolution of the people that are

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,880
actually in the group okay the people

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,260
you know the people you work with you

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,060
know what kind of communications are

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,589
going to accept whether they're going to

00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,060
take something that's abrupt but it's

00:14:57,589 --> 00:15:00,440
something that's straightforward or if

00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,399
you have to be a little more politically

00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,319
correct okay among my group of people

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,959
yeah we have occasionally had the line

00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,339
this explosion happens but if we're very

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,310
tightening group and we working together

00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:14,899
for seven years right I would not do

00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:16,790
that to someone who's just come on to my

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:18,750
project because the very first thing

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:20,910
they're gonna do is like okay

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,310
that's not what I want I want to grow my

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:25,410
project I want to extend my community I

00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,710
want to show people what we as a whole

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:31,880
are capable out when someone does this

00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:34,350
to you don't take offense immediately

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,020
everybody's culture everybody's

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:39,180
mannerisms everybody's behaviors even in

00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,680
our societies of the world are just a

00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:43,650
little bit different you need to see

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,950
what they're trying to say to you take

00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:50,460
that evaluate what they've said then

00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:53,640
respond or directly apply the response

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,560
of your an idiot might be because i know

00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,930
you're better than this what are you

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,770
doing but if you do this is somebody new

00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:04,110
they don't know that but keep in mind at

00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,970
the same time this can actually be

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:09,540
assigned to you that you have reached

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:12,750
that point in respect so if it happens

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:17,970
think before you flip out in response

00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:23,100
okay the one thing you don't want to do

00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:25,589
is ever ignore anyone I have people that

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,810
I unfortunately did lose from my project

00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:31,290
because they asked me questions over and

00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:32,130
over and over again I really should have

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,130
answered a couple more of those

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:38,250
questions I had to take that I had to

00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:40,530
learn what I've ended up doing is he

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:42,450
cleaned me out of respect to ask me

00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:44,400
questions to get my feelings on a

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,839
problem or what I thought was the

00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:49,200
correct way to do it within our bounds

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,880
and our procedures and I didn't answer

00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,830
him because I thought he should know

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,560
where she should know where to go and

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,640
get that information turns out he left

00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,950
and he's now Ryan a different

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,660
distribution on his own so he was

00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:04,290
perfectly capable of joining my inner

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:08,880
circle but because I chose to behave in

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:13,520
a way that angered him I ended up losing

00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
that possibility yep

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:28,199
right now note that I said the surest

00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:29,490
way to be ignored is to ignore that what

00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:31,290
you don't want to do is ignore somebody

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,550
on a consistent basis there are times

00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:33,990
when we all know that the something has

00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:35,760
happened at we indicate step back

00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,140
sometimes people just aggravated

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,820
sometimes we just had a really bad day

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:42,750
and somebody can so we need to be

00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,250
careful I'm saying don't go oh okay well

00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,900
this guy I don't want to deal with any

00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,800
of the noobs today I'm not gonna answer

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,240
this guy's question at all right at some

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:53,730
point they may ask a really stupid

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,120
question in your eyes but then you have

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:59,550
to remember that it's at some point you

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,650
didn't know that much either less than

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:05,070
five years ago I barely knew anything

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,210
about linux and I I definitely got my

00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,830
fair share of what the hell are you

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:12,930
asking is for you should know better

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:14,700
right it happened so there are times

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,530
when you do need to step down the

00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:24,810
communication but I'm saying don't be

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:26,300
dead silent that makes sense so we're

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:29,340
going a little faster than I thought but

00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:31,050
education right how can we deal with

00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:32,190
this within our community how can we

00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:33,690
deal with this negativity that we've

00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,550
actually brewed within it and as a

00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,580
result of everything that we've had to

00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:40,110
deal with in our time and unfortunately

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:42,920
because we had done us we've then

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:46,020
inadvertently done it for somebody else

00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:48,210
the key component to the foss community

00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:51,360
in the linux workspaces and things like

00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,710
that is definitively the fact that we

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,180
want to share our knowledge we want to

00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:55,590
take what we've done be able to give it

00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,970
to other people and know that they can

00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,380
make use of it take our knowledge and

00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,790
share with other people so they can then

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,090
make use of that the benefit of others

00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:05,070
as well right I do have some proprietary

00:19:03,090 --> 00:19:06,540
projects that's obviously slightly

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,800
different story but for what I do with

00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:10,410
unex and I do with my open source

00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:14,790
projects this is extremely well I'm

00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:16,170
going for the active learning and

00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,200
growing as individuals of community if

00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:21,990
that were to stop when mentoring stops

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,910
when the acceptance of guidance stops

00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:25,710
because we think somebody's I can do

00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,760
hide and mighty but

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,600
they're just failing to communicate

00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:34,230
clearly there are no longer that there

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,480
we feed directly back into the cycle you

00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,789
create another hungry person or you

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,750
become that person who is angry at the

00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:43,950
noob right this is a cycle you want to

00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:45,179
know why we're not in the year the

00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:48,990
desktop while we're not doing whatever

00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:51,809
it is because we have these problems we

00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:56,399
have to as a community take an effort

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:57,990
and a step to go beyond this we need to

00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,620
be welcoming we need to understand that

00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,390
they're going to people that are

00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,470
becoming in they're not going to know

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:03,179
anything about linux or they're not

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:06,240
going to know anything about IP tables

00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:08,640
or the way a penetration testing distro

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,340
works any number of examples I can bring

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,169
out right you may have somebody who's

00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,730
interested they have a minor interest

00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:16,610
that you may actually be able to feed

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,169
them a small amount of information and

00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,090
they will become highly interested and

00:20:19,169 --> 00:20:25,529
they'll become actually a contributing

00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:28,890
developer these things that's called

00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:31,260
being a mentor it's highly critical

00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:33,059
there's an entire time in all of our

00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:35,159
societies where you did not become a

00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:37,169
tradesman without somebody directly

00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:39,899
mentoring you and teaching you what you

00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,669
needed to know college doesn't fix all

00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:45,000
of that you need real world experience

00:20:41,669 --> 00:20:47,039
and the way we do that is by actually

00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,720
going out and talking and answering the

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,429
questions that people have and not

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,419
glossing over them because you don't

00:20:50,429 --> 00:20:56,669
think it's worth your time evangelism is

00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,470
a critical piece we need to tell the

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:00,899
people what we're doing why we're doing

00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:02,580
it why we think it's important but we

00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:04,380
can't be fanatic about it because the

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:07,140
moment we go into that fanatical

00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,669
behavior we go back into producing fud

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:14,399
we go back into producing angry news so

00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:17,010
we have a problem as people and as a

00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:22,140
community in this individuals we have to

00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:25,919
deal with that greg kroah-hartman made a

00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:27,000
very small comment when asked what

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,230
happens when you go into this place in

00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,789
they don't know anything when he said

00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,770
essentially it's and this is this piece

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,630
of the quote is accurate it is always

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,490
kindergarten somewhere because it going

00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,299
some people will know something some

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,059
people will know it

00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,100
and some people will know diddly they

00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:47,029
know how to use excel and now they have

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,860
to go manage a Linux or a boss project

00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,869
did you imagine dealing with someone

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,720
like that think a second thing about on

00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,649
your own what kind of steps you would

00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,769
have to do it would you mean your

00:21:55,649 --> 00:22:01,019
response be just forget it or would it

00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:02,100
be okay I'm going to have to take a

00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:05,929
slightly to even approach with this

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,929
person and guide them a little more

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,039
moving forward we can pretty much all

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,320
agree i believe you know you knowledge

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:15,269
to say the least that this is

00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,970
definitively a bad thing and that we

00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:19,590
need to look back in my opinion and look

00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:22,799
at all of our individual and as our

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:24,720
group and our communities and what we've

00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,249
actually done how we've reacted to these

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,539
people coming in these people asking

00:22:26,249 --> 00:22:30,059
these questions these people wanting to

00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:33,210
learn or maybe wanted to learn but we'll

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:35,399
see how the community is first then can

00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:38,279
we commit actually being welcoming to

00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:40,109
these people can we take our pride out

00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,710
of the way our elitism out of the way

00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:48,779
and actually take the step it's required

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:50,639
to bring and grow these communities most

00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:53,279
important when those people come to you

00:22:50,639 --> 00:22:55,019
with a simple question even if it's a

00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:57,659
simple question you know that's in the

00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:00,059
documentation or it's on the wiki or you

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,690
can just do man or you can just pull it

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:06,649
up and do help on the command line

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:10,850
sometimes they don't know that yet so

00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:13,889
just saying rtfm is not a correct answer

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,509
you need to actually find out did you

00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:18,929
run the help don't say you need to run

00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:20,429
help rtfm you need to say did you run

00:23:18,929 --> 00:23:24,359
help have you checked for the manual

00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:25,919
entry be welcoming if you chase them off

00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:28,799
on their first question you never know

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,119
what you're going to miss your we pretty

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:36,929
much agree that these are things that we

00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:37,919
as a whole have to do now I know that

00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,139
some people thinking well I've never

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,470
done that and while nobody in this room

00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:44,970
may be thinking that I know that there's

00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:47,100
a people watching and some of those

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,659
people that's never been me I'm not that

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,700
angry nubra I'm not the one inducing

00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:54,210
angry noob

00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,530
yeah you kind of did at some point in

00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:57,590
some way if you take the time and you

00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:59,550
think about it you have done this

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:01,470
whether you've done it mentally or

00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:03,500
you've done it verbally you've done it

00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:06,270
to somebody there will always be those

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:08,160
users the ones that annoy you the ones

00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:11,670
that ask the questions that are just

00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,250
problematic but it's up to us to educate

00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:17,160
and convert those people into valuable

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:21,090
members of our communities of our

00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:23,370
projects okay sometimes the person can't

00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:26,700
write a lick of code that's fine there a

00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:28,590
user maybe they love the project they

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,080
love what it does but instead they can

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:34,920
actually contribute greatly by improving

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,720
your wiki that's the first step for

00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,830
somebody who doesn't write any code to

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,930
actually get involved in the false

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:43,620
community be in the discussions be an

00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:46,520
advocate in the process of doing this

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,490
you're adding value to yourself and to

00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,020
the community because that person will

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,930
come to respect you they will come for

00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,340
you to get advice and acknowledgment on

00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,990
things that they can't manage to find on

00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:02,520
their own those are key things that

00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,740
allow us to actually grow going forward

00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,600
we already live in a society that's

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,140
heavily consumer eyes and live in a

00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,090
black box do you really want everyone

00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:13,920
you know to be somebody who just works

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:15,960
in a black box this is what it does I

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,580
don't care what it can do I don't care

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,830
how it works do you really want

00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:23,220
everybody to be like that we have entire

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,560
things right raspberry behind into our

00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:27,300
education stem from that the entire stem

00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:32,090
system within the United States

00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:38,070
education are made to fix that problem

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:41,180
don't feed the problem be a member of

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:43,980
your community but be an active and

00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:46,320
valuable member of your community by not

00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,710
being angry noob and not chasing the

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:52,320
noob off or inciting the anger in the

00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:54,750
new we've all been there we've all been

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:58,710
in kindergarten and in my case I've gone

00:25:54,750 --> 00:26:00,830
from diddly everything i'm at in sub

00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:04,470
five years

00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:06,090
it's been a weird and bumpy road and I

00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:08,580
hope that other people can follow that

00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:14,730
same road but maybe with a few less

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:17,220
bumps and a few less hammers that's the

00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:20,220
end of my slides but if anybody has a

00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:45,750
question feedback this is obviously a

00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:48,630
perfect time to do that mmm those are

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:52,200
fun ones they are but from my experience

00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:54,470
and this is both in Windows and

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,080
application programming and just users

00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:00,029
okay what you have to do is explain to

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,940
them that it's not a simple question

00:27:00,029 --> 00:27:04,140
even if they want a simple answer

00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:05,490
because I know that those are people out

00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,090
there like I just wanted to do this I

00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:12,210
get that you have to take the step and

00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:14,610
guide them very gently that what their

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,580
answer is going to be I can summarize it

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:20,970
but you need to know more and try and

00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:25,140
point them to those points of fact and

00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:27,049
you know what those people are not going

00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:30,570
to be around long of their own volition

00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:33,120
because they have a perception and an

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:34,799
observation of what they want not what

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,289
reality is and it doesn't matter whether

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,549
you're dealing with anything's or Navon

00:27:39,289 --> 00:27:43,440
it happens in every society with

00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:44,880
everything that you're doing look I just

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,909
want my car do this you can make it do

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,960
that right doesn't mean I can it doesn't

00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:53,580
mean it's going to be simple but you

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,770
have to understand and try and get them

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,370
to realize that their choice or

00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:01,789
assumption may be inaccurate and it's

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,789
not easy

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,220
right

00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,270
how

00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:42,130
right right inviting how do you deal

00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:45,220
with infighting when somebody you notice

00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:47,650
somebody in your community doing the the

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:50,710
fun or saying just going around flatly

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:54,190
this attitude the only way that you can

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:56,830
do that is be attempt to be polite okay

00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,480
if you're if you know that this person

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:01,210
only responds to start take it to a

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,890
private channel take it to a public out

00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:04,890
of the public eye long enough to tell

00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:08,770
the person look you're not being helpful

00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:10,180
you can do this gently in public I have

00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:12,010
users and you've seen it in my channel

00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,000
personally they come in and they're like

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:15,790
well maybe you should go back to

00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,780
whatever and my immediate response is

00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:19,240
you're not helping and you're not

00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:23,170
answering the question please allow me

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:24,580
to actually do that I know some people

00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:26,920
are touchy about that they don't like

00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:28,870
being told that they're misbehaving or

00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:30,700
they're not helping things but i

00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:34,060
encourage you to explain over time

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:36,370
doesn't always happen in a day that this

00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,660
is not good for the benefit of the

00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:39,520
community and if they're going to

00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:41,160
continue to do that no one in the

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,410
community will actually respect them

00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:46,240
because truthfully if you're angry every

00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:48,670
day at your family or at the people at

00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,610
work and you're responding in short

00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:52,600
snide comments what are they going to do

00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:59,310
they're going to get angry with you and

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:59,310
eventually taper you out okay yes

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:19,310
yes

00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:07,649
or

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:16,120
right and forgive me the the question

00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,830
was with assistant e versus an anti

00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,300
system d and the behaviors that are that

00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:21,640
are happening there there are valid

00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,350
points on both sides of the discussion

00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,090
and the same thing is with dnf versus

00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:28,030
young man changing an expected behavior

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:30,220
in a program when somebody changes a key

00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:33,670
component out or provides an alternative

00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:36,820
it can induce both fanaticism because

00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:38,980
not necessarily all parts have actually

00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:41,860
read and looked into all of the details

00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:44,380
I agree that there are definitely times

00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:46,000
when our expected behaviors change and

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:48,700
when that happens it can be detrimental

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,130
if they haven't been clearly noted that

00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:55,630
things have occurred in the particular

00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:57,190
example case was dnf versus yum and with

00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:59,320
the new behavior with yum you could

00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,270
actually have your running kernel

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:02,700
deleted but you know hey we designed it

00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:06,760
that way every you can use this flag

00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:09,630
right that's a perfectly valid point and

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,890
that's not necessarily new related but

00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,860
what happens when the people on the

00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:18,360
outside of the discussion see us they're

00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:22,050
seeing us having heated fanatic debates

00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:25,630
instead of having relatively reserved

00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:27,190
discussion right and I'm not saying that

00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:29,950
the discussion about Susan to you or

00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:31,330
about um change or dnf flip flip over

00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:33,010
and things like that are completely

00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:34,720
inaccurate I'm not saying in or that

00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:37,710
they're detrimental what I'm saying is

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,410
if you take something somebody his head

00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:43,810
said and they put it out there and you

00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:47,800
read it and you don't actually check any

00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:49,710
of the facts even just the slightest

00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:52,240
detail to see whether it's right or not

00:32:49,710 --> 00:32:54,130
then you don't have a play as jumping in

00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,720
and saying hey you know I really think

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:58,180
he's right and you're an idiot for

00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,470
thinking otherwise because somebody

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:00,940
outside that community will see our

00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,040
discussions because we as a community

00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:07,720
have open and public discussions on a

00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:10,410
regular basis that can induce that kind

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:13,330
of behavior from the people that are new

00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:17,320
so that's how those discussions can be a

00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:18,850
problem when they're not educated that's

00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,610
a problem the people that are having

00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,440
educated discussion

00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:25,590
managed to have it but you end up with

00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,720
the fanatics on either side the fanatics

00:33:25,590 --> 00:34:20,820
are the problem not the educated

00:33:27,720 --> 00:34:31,250
discussion okay two weeks later I've got

00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:31,250
unis same as ours liar duration

00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:41,909
hmm does this is the best ones

00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:44,159
unfortunately those happen in public and

00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:46,500
private projects and it doesn't really

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,220
matter the people that just want you to

00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,020
do their job for them no matter what

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:54,360
those people can be a problem in any

00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,190
community and your best chance if you

00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:58,590
can't get them and guide them to

00:34:56,190 --> 00:35:02,540
actually be an active role in their own

00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:05,220
knowledge then you need to very gently

00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,880
met them understand that you are

00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:10,560
literally not their support person and

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,620
that you will guide them but you can't

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,570
do their job and if you they want you to

00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:20,310
do their job they can hire you right

00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,570
they need to understand that just

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,990
because we're free and open source

00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:27,360
software does not mean we are free right

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:32,430
we're contributing to a community and a

00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:35,070
cycle and an ecosystem when we are not

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:37,320
able to do it because we don't have any

00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:40,170
funds because we're literally doing it

00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:42,960
for free then the entire thing spirals

00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:45,690
back down out of control and that person

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,930
although a user they're not an interest

00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:50,760
user in any way shape or form they're

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,970
they're definitively a problematic user

00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:58,160
to the community's support but they're

00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:58,160
barely a user of the software in any way

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,440
unfortunately there's also those people

00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:24,330
and for the people in the stream that

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,560
may not have heard him the first time

00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,140
you the people that come in and just

00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:30,780
demand to know how to do something or

00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:32,670
tell you hey just show me how to do it

00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,770
right now without filling out the

00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:37,020
fleshing details especially if they come

00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,810
in and say you've got Apache with a V

00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,090
host and they don't have either multiple

00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:43,710
IPS or they've necessary routing and DNS

00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,570
configured but they want to have a V

00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:47,220
host with five subdomains and all this

00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:49,590
stuff and they've never even touched an

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,830
Apache configuration file or an HD

00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:54,540
access those people are the ones that

00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:56,160
you just have to deal with the fact

00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,810
they're not going to like you because

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,500
you told them they can't have it for

00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:04,410
free that's the entitled user that's the

00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:08,460
petulant child behavior and it doesn't

00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:11,940
matter if you're 10 15 30 90 they exist

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:35,310
and it's really unfortunate but we still

00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:37,950
have to be polite that one can be a fun

00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,510
one when you have somebody that's saying

00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:42,480
hey you're being a funnel neck about

00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:44,670
this then you as a person who is being

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,080
accused of being a fanatic you need to

00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:47,990
take your step back and do a very quick

00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:51,570
evaluation am I actually being a fanatic

00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:53,130
okay then you have to say I'm not being

00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:55,860
a fanatic about this this is an educated

00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:57,930
I'm a little lively about it but it is

00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,460
an educated discussion and here's all of

00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:01,500
my back and points and ask them why

00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,850
they're calling you a fanatic they're

00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,160
saying you're a fanatic then they need

00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:08,250
to back up why what you're saying is

00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:10,830
either ignorant or wrong and that's how

00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:13,650
an actual debate occurs how a discussion

00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,900
really occurs what we have happen is

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,240
that we have

00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,910
immature communication and then things

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,069
like fanaticism occur and the literal

00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,630
bickering starts happening you're not

00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:26,880
even on subject anymore and people are

00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:29,309
starting to Becker about things that is

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,670
a problem but the only way to do that is

00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:33,960
to properly bring debate points and that

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:36,410
comes down to communication and

00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:36,410
education

00:38:55,300 --> 00:39:01,210
right and for the audience we have a

00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:04,510
gentleman who has grad students and they

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:06,910
asked him about a linux box and the

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:09,220
first thing he does is he shows in the

00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:10,630
app repos and he shows in the main

00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:12,040
command and showing hey there's

00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,160
documentation right off the bat and

00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:18,220
sometimes these people glaze over like

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,430
that was there the whole time because

00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,780
they didn't necessarily know to go look

00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,450
for those things because they didn't

00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:26,740
know that they could expect those things

00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,660
that's one of those times when you're a

00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:34,090
simple education of the community around

00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:36,190
you and popping their bubbles gently can

00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,980
really produce a lot of growth in that

00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:52,170
person just because it will incite

00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:52,170
curiosity in them to explore yeah bird

00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:58,980
anyone else want anything yes

00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:11,230
you

00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,260
right and we have a comment from one of

00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,320
the fellows in the audience who has a

00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,260
answer to anger knew the petulant child

00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,530
the person who's decided that they can

00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,750
come after you because it's not XP Haven

00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:42,750
as they expect versus how it actually

00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:45,900
does and I'll go ahead and have that

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:50,120
checked up on the notes but I can't

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:52,110
remember the entire URL so my apologies

00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:57,020
maybe else any other feedback any other

00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:57,020
topic yes

00:41:17,859 --> 00:41:28,580
okay you're very right right and you're

00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,050
completely right okay the comment is

00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,420
that the people from the outside need to

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:33,800
understand then you did column to the

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,390
realization that in our community we

00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:38,570
have open discussions sometimes they

00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:40,070
become heated right and I'm not saying

00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:42,710
that discussion shouldn't happen and

00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:46,760
that they shouldn't be heated because

00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:51,850
sometimes people are brick walls what

00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:54,710
I'm saying is that you can't necessarily

00:41:51,850 --> 00:41:58,070
expect somebody not to take what you

00:41:54,710 --> 00:42:02,270
said out of context so even in the heat

00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:04,730
of the moment we say things but try to

00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:06,230
make sure that when you're saying it who

00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,390
you're saying it's you and the context

00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:10,400
of what you're saying is clear right

00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:13,310
because we literally have the entire

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,570
internet that is listening to us and

00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:19,910
then some person at a reporting agency

00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:21,680
pulls out one stupid quote and the next

00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,740
thing you know we've got the entire

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,170
internet in a report he's a meanie all

00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:28,790
right in our groups within our

00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:31,609
conversations within the cultures that

00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:34,460
we have created yes those discussions

00:42:31,609 --> 00:42:38,900
happen we're grown men worker-owned

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,280
women we are able to understand the

00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:42,460
difference between what someone is

00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,840
saying and what they're trying to convey

00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,400
right that comes down to part of the

00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:49,550
communication you need to know how to

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,840
actually step aside from the words being

00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:55,730
used versus what's being expressed right

00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,980
if they're using expletive language

00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:59,000
they're probably really frustrated

00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,869
because the other person is not

00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:05,090
listening at all right but what they're

00:43:02,869 --> 00:43:07,220
saying the merits of the technical

00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,810
points that is in the discussion that's

00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,760
what needs to be paid attention to and

00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:14,180
yes the people that come into these

00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,010
communities have to understand that they

00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:17,180
need to do this which is why I'm doing

00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,309
this

00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:22,490
it covers both us in the communities and

00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:24,440
those outside the communities you need

00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,150
to know you need to know that people are

00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:31,490
observing you and people that are doing

00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:33,589
the observing you need to know stuff

00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:35,240
happens communication gaps occur

00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:39,520
sometimes people get into heated

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,520
arguments and you buddy ever seen a bar

00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,160
you

00:44:04,059 --> 00:44:08,799
it doesn't get a pass you're right the

00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:10,479
the gentleman back had made that the

00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:11,920
points that I'm making the observations

00:44:10,479 --> 00:44:14,410
that we've had in the discussion here

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:16,539
are applicable to any community whether

00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:19,180
it's in what we do whether it's in our

00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:21,579
communities or within our own corporate

00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,439
culture there's no reason as an example

00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:25,630
that Linus should be the one that gets

00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:28,150
away with it I'm not saying that he

00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:29,650
should write but people need to

00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:31,299
understand when he's saying this he's

00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:33,130
saying this to his tight-knit group but

00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:36,489
there's somebody out here listening in

00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:38,410
that's the observational person we need

00:44:36,489 --> 00:44:40,809
to be aware that they're saying is but

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:43,660
you made a very valid point personal

00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:47,259
attacks are never a valid discussion

00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:49,719
topic ever don't do that it doesn't

00:44:47,259 --> 00:44:51,039
matter who you are where you are doesn't

00:44:49,719 --> 00:44:52,479
matter if you're in church doesn't

00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:54,699
matter if your dinner table it doesn't

00:44:52,479 --> 00:44:58,749
matter if the office personal attacks

00:44:54,699 --> 00:45:01,180
are off-limits because it's going to

00:44:58,749 --> 00:45:04,420
degrade and you know as soon as you say

00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:06,189
it it's going to degrade you're going to

00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,979
ruin the entire conversation and

00:45:06,189 --> 00:45:10,329
everybody now has to come back to it and

00:45:07,979 --> 00:45:20,579
rehash the whole thing after they've all

00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:23,499
calm down very true and this ties back

00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:24,939
right here that gentleman said if you're

00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:26,650
in the channel or if you're in the

00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:29,199
communication medium and you have the

00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,589
ability to respond and you do not say

00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:33,849
hey this is a problem in your behavior

00:45:31,589 --> 00:45:37,739
then you're just as complicit because

00:45:33,849 --> 00:45:37,739
you're turning a blind eye to it

00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,750
yes and he's exactly right sometimes no

00:45:56,950 --> 00:46:00,550
matter what you do the person thinks

00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:02,350
that you're being aggressive that you're

00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,810
having an attitude with them you're

00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:06,250
dismissive and sometimes that's just the

00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:09,430
person's personality cuz they're not

00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,570
getting what they want and that comes

00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:12,550
right back to the petulant child

00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:15,640
attitude you're not doing what I asked

00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:18,190
you to whoa it's ryan here and that's

00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:20,800
unfortunately part of our communication

00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:24,990
as a society whether it's within Foss or

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,070
not the other trick is people say things

00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:30,280
because they think they have some guard

00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:34,540
of anonymity and in our community people

00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:37,390
learn who you are right we have these

00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:39,430
meetings you're on social media people

00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,320
know and get to know you over the time

00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:43,840
that you spend in the community you

00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,430
can't just say things and expect no

00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:47,770
ramification from it and some people

00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:50,880
really do just do that and some people

00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,880
really do just do this in person

00:47:17,349 --> 00:47:19,410
you

00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:26,840
very accurate both backing up of what

00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,760
I've just said in regards to who and

00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:30,470
what people say whether they do it in

00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:31,940
person versus behind a keyboard and then

00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:34,430
there's the other fact that we're using

00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:36,050
a medium that can't convey facial

00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,990
expression that can't convey the

00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:40,670
connotation of body language and for

00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:42,920
that reason you need to take everything

00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:44,900
you read with a little bit of a grain of

00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,850
salt because they may not have intended

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:49,250
to insult you or they may not have

00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:50,360
intended to dismiss you what they may

00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:53,500
have actually tried to give you an

00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:55,760
answer but they failed to put it into

00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,310
written word on what they're trying to

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,920
express that happens sometimes clarity

00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:27,410
can be an issue because the mediums we

00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:29,810
use for communication exactly when you

00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:33,200
when you have the the example that I've

00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:35,600
given is that we have a child who's

00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,160
playing a video game right sometimes

00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:38,900
they can get very animated you get a wii

00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,280
and it's flinging around like crazy and

00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:41,780
they get upset or frustrated with

00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:43,730
themselves it just starts getting flung

00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,470
around even harder or the the xbox

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:47,480
controller goes across the room is there

00:48:45,470 --> 00:48:50,420
so frustrated with it however if you're

00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:53,180
playing a board game with a parent a

00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:55,790
friend you know that you've got somebody

00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:57,410
right there they're going to be upset if

00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,840
you start getting petrol in it or anger

00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:03,410
it throwing a piece they're gonna be

00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:06,140
like okay well this is over and in our

00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:08,120
online media channels outside of voice

00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:13,100
conversations outside of a video chat

00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:15,050
this is a problem because we at this

00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:16,730
point should know that there are

00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:19,820
contexts of connotation that cannot come

00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:21,860
through text alone but it's a perfect

00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:25,040
example with the children they know the

00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:26,240
difference between this medium on this

00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:28,250
medium because there's actually another

00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:29,700
person and they know that they don't

00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,730
want to be treated that way

00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:34,620
when it comes to electronic media the

00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:36,770
person may never seen the person may not

00:49:34,620 --> 00:50:00,540
know their name doesn't give a rats and

00:49:36,770 --> 00:50:02,430
it just blurts out of people right right

00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:05,610
there there is a certain amount of snark

00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:07,200
but you're very right extra connotation

00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:10,560
that you cannot put in text through a

00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,910
particular use of emoticon can be very

00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:14,160
helpful in people understanding that

00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:16,020
it's actually a joke hopefully there

00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:20,750
aren't already bad mood because they may

00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,750
not read the emoticon over here

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:34,290
right we're not talking to bots and

00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:37,050
that's exactly what you're right the

00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:39,860
young lady in the crowd commend you for

00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:43,230
being at this conference I add thank you

00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:47,580
just for your age to be here I'm very

00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:49,650
happy to see you here but because people

00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,290
don't associate a real person on the

00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,720
other end they don't get any emotional

00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,130
attachment to their own behavior when

00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,020
you disassociate the fact that you're

00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,750
actually interacting with a person this

00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:02,460
isn't some chat bot on the other end

00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:04,290
this is somebody who's either trying to

00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:07,650
work or trying to help you because

00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:09,990
they've done this before right you can't

00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:12,420
just blurt at someone but you have to be

00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:14,790
able to accept that people may not have

00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:18,810
made that jump that maturity in their

00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:22,830
own behavior to not do that so that can

00:51:18,810 --> 00:51:25,080
be very hard as the receiver or if you

00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:26,670
don't recognize that you're doing it the

00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:28,680
education of the person hey there is

00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,540
actually someone on the other end can

00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,030
actually be something that's really hard

00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:35,880
to do if these people never get out they

00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:38,220
never attempt and even sometimes people

00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:41,070
with know that they're on camera and

00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,520
they say things and it's just the

00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:46,500
dumbest thing you have ever heard it

00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:48,810
happens unfortunately we're all human I

00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:57,470
don't know about you but I can't walk on

00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:57,470
it I tend the sink nobody else yes

00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:14,340
huh the the comment is that even when

00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,930
you're working a global company there's

00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,820
people that you may work with on a very

00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:19,590
regular basis but you've never met in

00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,330
person right and then when you actually

00:52:19,590 --> 00:52:23,940
do me in person now you have a face to

00:52:21,330 --> 00:52:25,500
the name and the communication right now

00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:27,450
you have somebody that you've had at

00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,950
least five minutes to have a

00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:31,890
conversation and get a judgment up

00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:35,460
that's part of our natural behavior as a

00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:37,650
human we're social animals when you've

00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:41,400
never had that physical interaction your

00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:45,000
brain literally does not have that piece

00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:47,160
in your behavioral setup right we're

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:49,260
based on our observations we're based on

00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:52,500
our interactions if your interaction is

00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:53,790
only ever a screen or an email maybe a

00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:56,700
phone you at least you've heard the

00:52:53,790 --> 00:53:01,040
voice like okay well the name is Janice

00:52:56,700 --> 00:53:04,460
but it is from Germany Oh is he whoops

00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:07,110
but if you meet this person face-to-face

00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:09,960
right that's totally different now you

00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:12,180
have a person you can put now you have

00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,120
an archetype that your mind can wrap

00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:18,570
around as a personality and now you

00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:20,040
become far more personable which is why

00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:22,680
for those people who may be listening

00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:24,150
and you've never attended the fest if

00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:26,160
you really want to make sure that you

00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:29,510
have this through your head attend a

00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:32,400
fast attend a lug attend any group that

00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:35,580
you've communicated exclusively through

00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:38,430
text me of some kind put any name to any

00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:41,910
face and realize that you may have said

00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:46,410
something once that was right on that

00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:48,810
line or a little above just even five

00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:50,550
minutes of that and you'll begin to

00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:51,870
register that you have to consider that

00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:54,600
there is somebody living at the other

00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:56,790
end of that keyboard and if you say

00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:59,870
something that pisses them off you're

00:53:56,790 --> 00:53:59,870
not helping the community

00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:12,019
anybody else know okay well thank you

00:54:10,519 --> 00:54:16,930
all for being a part of the discussion

00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:16,930
and listening Oh got one more back

00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:40,090
you

00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:49,289
okay Seaton step careful in this crowd

00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,289
we know

00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:15,290
okay and the comment from the back is

00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:17,390
that the in our communities we have

00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,740
documentation in multiple places some of

00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:21,080
it's not documented and that's some

00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:24,110
things that we need to fix as opposed to

00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:26,210
some some groups or pieces of software

00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:29,390
projects where all the documentation is

00:55:26,210 --> 00:55:32,180
entirely centralized right now the

00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:38,150
particular example was a proprietary OS

00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:41,720
in that case while you do have note that

00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:44,210
I kept that civil that note that you do

00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,369
indeed actually have one point in the

00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:48,890
end to ensure that all the documentation

00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:50,210
is in place right you may have thousands

00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:52,040
or tens of thousands of people that are

00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:53,690
actually committing and adding to the

00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:55,340
documentation or realizing the part of

00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:57,020
its missing and then adding it didn't

00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:00,380
you in that way even in those

00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:02,420
proprietary os's gaps occur but they

00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:04,190
have people that explicitly take the

00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:07,970
time to ensure that those gaps get

00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:09,380
closed and we as a group come back to

00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:11,150
the education we need to make sure that

00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,340
those manuals are accurate we need to

00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:15,590
make sure that they're updated we do

00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:20,450
have black in that we don't have a

00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:22,850
cohesive single point but do the danger

00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:25,310
ever distributed behaviors we can't have

00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:29,570
that but what we do need to do is come

00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:31,730
to a consensus as a whole that we are

00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:34,700
going to make sure that it's easy to

00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:37,420
access and to the information is indeed

00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:41,920
available and not hold away held in some

00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:41,920
accidental elitist knowledge

00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:20,790
you still have

00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,069
right and the comment is that if say you

00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:41,650
have somebody's trying to understand why

00:57:39,069 --> 00:57:44,859
something isn't clearly labeled when it

00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:48,160
comes to Windows versus a linux desktop

00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:50,980
or a Windows Server versus linux server

00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,259
or a mail server on post fix versus

00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:54,369
exchange there are still gaps in the

00:57:53,259 --> 00:57:56,859
communication there's still user

00:57:54,369 --> 00:57:57,819
feedback creates natural documentation

00:57:56,859 --> 00:57:59,799
and what we need to do is take the

00:57:57,819 --> 00:58:02,109
effort to make that public and noted

00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:04,869
that when it creates viable

00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:05,980
documentation we fill that gap I'm not

00:58:04,869 --> 00:58:07,900
saying it's easy i'm not saying it's

00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,609
going to take a very short amount of

00:58:07,900 --> 00:58:10,720
time it's going to take time and effort

00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:12,640
because the discussions are going to

00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,809
evolve and we're going to get better

00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,460
documentation because people are going

00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:17,349
to say this isn't good look this didn't

00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:19,599
work for me why did it not work for me

00:58:17,349 --> 00:58:21,609
and make a note of the use case things

00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:26,710
like that happen even in proprietary

00:58:21,609 --> 00:58:28,180
projects but we as a community tend to

00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:31,119
have a little more often because we've

00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:32,410
come to the default that hey you should

00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:33,730
just go search for it you should check

00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:35,380
the forms you could go look for the

00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:38,230
wikis and see if anybody else has had

00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:40,210
this discussion whereas if you go to

00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:42,039
some of these other communities they say

00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:43,329
okay I can I've seen this one before

00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:46,119
I've had this discussion with someone

00:58:43,329 --> 00:58:48,009
will find it for you I have had the

00:58:46,119 --> 00:58:49,299
experience where people don't always do

00:58:48,009 --> 00:58:51,160
that they say well it's out there go

00:58:49,299 --> 00:58:52,720
find it I know I've done it to people

00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:55,089
and I apologize to those people

00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,769
afterwards because I realized I was just

00:58:55,089 --> 00:58:59,109
pointing them with a little bit of money

00:58:56,769 --> 00:59:00,460
time and effort not saying I can give

00:58:59,109 --> 00:59:02,759
them an hour and a half to solve the

00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:08,529
problem but it's something about do

00:59:02,759 --> 00:59:10,890
personally did you want to squeeze one

00:59:08,529 --> 00:59:10,890
in real quick

00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:32,700
pan privatized catharsis versus

00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:34,410
publicized Anthony hmm oh and right and

00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,760
the comment here was that that is

00:59:34,410 --> 00:59:37,250
definitely something there go to

00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,160
communicate you medium to get an answer

00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:42,450
don't go that event that's entirely true

00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,250
because then you're just feeding the

00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:50,490
problem all over again it's right into

00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:53,480
that cycle thank you again thanks

00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:53,480
everybody for coming and listening

01:00:29,609 --> 01:00:31,670
you

01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,820
you

01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:03,290
your customers rely on your website or

01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:05,690
application if it's slower

01:02:03,290 --> 01:02:08,630
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:10,430
and costs you money keeping your

01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:13,970
business critical systems humming along

01:02:10,430 --> 01:02:16,820
requires insight into what they're doing

01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:18,800
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:21,020
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,210
resource limitations and other problems

01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:25,970
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:28,460
your systems performance metrics in room

01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:31,099
and record this data for later analysis

01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:33,170
enter longview the new way to see what's

01:02:31,099 --> 01:02:34,910
really going on under the hood the

01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:37,700
longview dashboard lets you visualize

01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:39,230
the status of all your systems providing

01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:42,290
you with a bird's-eye view of your

01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:45,260
entire fleet you can sort by cpu memory

01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:47,660
swap processes load and network usage

01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:50,030
click a specific system to access its

01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:51,980
individual dashboard then click and drag

01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:54,830
to zoom in on chokepoints and get more

01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:56,840
detail comprehensive network data

01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:59,540
including inbound and outbound traffic

01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:01,520
is available on the network tab and disk

01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:03,710
rights and free space on the disks tab

01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:05,750
while the process Explorer displays

01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,150
usage statistics for individual

01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:10,280
processes the system info tab shows

01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:12,530
listening services active connections

01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:14,660
and available updates adding long view

01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:16,369
to a system is easy just click the

01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:18,530
button copy the one line installation

01:03:16,369 --> 01:03:20,960
command then run the command on your

01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:22,670
linux system to complete the process the

01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,859
agent will begin collecting data and

01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:28,369
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:30,589
start rolling use long view to gain

01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:34,779
visibility into your servers so when

01:03:30,589 --> 01:03:36,579
your website or app heats up it stays up

01:03:34,779 --> 01:03:38,739
citrix xenserver gives you everything

01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:41,739
you need to integrate manage and

01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:43,869
automate a virtual data center all on an

01:03:41,739 --> 01:03:46,239
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

01:03:43,869 --> 01:03:48,999
platform and at a third of the cost of

01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:50,709
other solutions but why even bother with

01:03:48,999 --> 01:03:52,869
virtualizing your server infrastructure

01:03:50,709 --> 01:03:54,849
in the first place well let's say you

01:03:52,869 --> 01:03:57,130
have a traditional one server to one

01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:59,140
application architecture but you're

01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:01,779
running out of resources and performance

01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:04,079
is suffering once you order new server

01:04:01,779 --> 01:04:06,969
hardware you'll wait for delivery

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,849
configure it install your business

01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:12,609
application stage and test the server

01:04:09,849 --> 01:04:14,829
and finally add it to your production

01:04:12,609 --> 01:04:17,019
farm if you've been through this process

01:04:14,829 --> 01:04:19,509
before you know it can take weeks or

01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:21,400
even months you also know it's a

01:04:19,509 --> 01:04:23,349
manually intensive process that will

01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:26,679
burden your team every time you outgrow

01:04:23,349 --> 01:04:28,839
your current setup with a virtual server

01:04:26,679 --> 01:04:31,359
solution you could have pumped all of

01:04:28,839 --> 01:04:33,939
that in less than half a day server

01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,769
virtualization software separates the OS

01:04:33,939 --> 01:04:38,079
and application from the underlying

01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:40,119
server hardware and with multiple

01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:41,859
virtual machines on a single server you
