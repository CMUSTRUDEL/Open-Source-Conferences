thank you sorry add it off first off you

00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:48,219
know my opinions are my own they're not

00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:51,039
my employers so about me my name is

00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:52,149
Jason edgecombe I'm the a linux

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,629
administrator in the College of

00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:57,699
Engineering at UNC Charlotte I open

00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:00,010
source work my personal time I'm the

00:00:57,699 --> 00:01:03,149
belmont admin for the open AFS project

00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,379
and I'm also contributed documentation

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:07,690
we have various websites up here

00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:12,610
including work and couple my personal

00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:16,179
sites including my github so let me give

00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,450
you a breakdown of the college we have

00:01:16,179 --> 00:01:21,340
five departments we have a most of the

00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,490
major engineering disciplines civil

00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,690
mechanical electrical well set of

00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,740
systems engineering and engineering

00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:31,690
technology for those who don't know the

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:34,119
systems engineering is more of an

00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:36,899
engineering management it's touted as

00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,220
the alternative to the NBA and

00:01:36,899 --> 00:01:42,509
engineering technology is more of

00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:45,460
applied so this is your technician level

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,040
to put in perspective an electrical

00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,680
engineer would design your pacemaker an

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,439
electrical engineering technician would

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,350
picture television that's the you know

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,759
they're more of applied that stuff and

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:00,189
in addition to the major departments we

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,689
also have various research centers one

00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,630
of the bigger ones that's been in the

00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:06,340
news recently as the epic center the

00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,829
electrical power and infrastructure

00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:13,209
Center big deal got a whole new building

00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:15,910
out of it so yeah epic so here are some

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:18,400
stats we have roughly thirty three

00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:21,880
hundred students who majored in the

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:26,769
College engineering in fall 2014 you

00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:30,070
2700 undergrads 600 grads all told we

00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:33,640
have rough a little over 200 faculty and

00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:36,519
staff that we have to support over 4,000

00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:39,760
login accounts as of as of last month

00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:42,100
and we have a 10-person IT team so these

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,109
are the full-timers plus various student

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,690
interns or actually students who we

00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:49,840
employ and that's part of their their

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,610
training their education we pay them and

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
they help us

00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,740
and in turn we help train them in or

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,360
their degree we have to linux admins for

00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:04,600
the college and we still manage to

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,210
support everything so we have to manage

00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,790
platforms of course we have windows you

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,130
can't avoid it and we have about 1200

00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:15,870
workstations for windows various

00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,870
supporting servers under windows as well

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,350
burden for mosaic linux and these are

00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,270
the titles of our platforms we have

00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,310
these branded platforms because the

00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:30,190
managed platform is called mosaic and

00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,650
mosaic windows is a managed platform the

00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:36,070
managed windows platform mosaic Linux is

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:38,530
our managed linux platform so on the

00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:41,110
linux side we have about 41 production

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:44,739
begins there's our servers mixture of

00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,080
bare metal and vm 65 linux desktops

00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:49,780
these are split amongst office and

00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:53,670
research labs and all told we have about

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:57,310
141 Linux machines between all told

00:03:53,670 --> 00:04:00,700
workstations pm's servers development

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,799
servers all that now I mentioned that we

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:05,220
have our mosaic platform we also have

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:08,110
very standalone machines so these are

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,390
semi managed they're not running the

00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,970
standard corporate style desktop that we

00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,220
like to support but this is how

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,680
researchers work is you know they cannot

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,769
be constrained by you know things like

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:26,680
you know actual best practices and IT

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:28,630
because that slows them down and no

00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,280
matter what we do it's it never seems to

00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:34,030
be fast enough they want to be able to

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,130
do it themselves so just so you know the

00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:39,040
college is one engineering college is

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:40,030
one college or one part of the

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,600
University of North Carolina at

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,280
Charlotte so we actually have multiple

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,800
distinct I key groups the colleges have

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,300
most colleges have their own IT group

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,910
and then we have a central group that

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,460
provides support for the entire campus

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,260
in addition to some of the colleges and

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,900
departments that don't have what we call

00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,430
distributed IT so the things that we

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,490
don't maintain in the College

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,900
engineering our campus Network it's a

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,590
network switch we typically don't mess

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,480
with it

00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:12,530
we don't you know have to maintain the

00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,840
websites central IT does that they you

00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,690
set us up with Drupal and some of our

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,480
staff and faculty just do edit Drupal

00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:23,510
pages we have a research cluster that's

00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,460
run by main campus ite that's called the

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:27,590
university research cluster they handle

00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:32,570
the kind of the big compute you know

00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:34,820
multi-node compute jobs so we also don't

00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,900
handle noodle or the campus ERP which we

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,940
use called banner so what we do support

00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:43,040
or what I support day today is the

00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,620
mosaic linux platform and on that

00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:48,440
platform we have over 50 commercial and

00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:51,130
open source software suites I mean

00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:54,410
sweets not just programs I mean you

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,360
synopsis or cadence I mean these are

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:58,910
each of these have like dozens of

00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,220
programs underneath them so it's a

00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:04,550
pretty big footprint currently we're

00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:07,100
runnin Red Hat Enterprise Linux five we

00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,800
run the client flavor on the

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,690
workstations and the client facing

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,060
servers where they log in and run big

00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:16,220
compute jobs and then we have the server

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,350
component or flavor that we run on our

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:22,760
back-end servers that only the IT staff

00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:26,840
login to so one of the critical things

00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,090
we've been you know very adamant about

00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,610
is only IT staff a fruit or pseudo

00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:33,290
access so this goes back to the manage

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,810
versus unmanaged and that's one of the

00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,390
reasons that people don't like to you

00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,070
might not like our managed platform is

00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,600
because they can't install stuff that

00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,600
they want or at least they don't have

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,640
the control that they want and one of

00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,860
the big things that stands out is the

00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,390
lenox team is actually responsible for

00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,420
the network storage for the entire

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:56,270
college so we run open FS as our network

00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:59,600
storage and we have those spread across

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,730
many servers so the lenox team is

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,640
actually porting the storage they even

00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:09,230
the windows team uses so everybody uses

00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:11,690
the links team so key philosophies that

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:14,870
we have we strive for a high level of

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:18,840
customer service automation is a way of

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,460
life now we don't typically use imaging

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,720
the windows team tends to use a little

00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,500
bit more that just for some server

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,930
backups but both teams use scripted

00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:30,169
installations so our windows team is

00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,340
doing okay they're doing you know

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,410
scripted install and then they have

00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,080
scripts after the install that start

00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:40,169
installing applications on Linux we're

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,780
using kickstart from Red Hat and then we

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:45,330
have post installation scripts that fire

00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,060
up their firing up running CF engine

00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:52,020
which in manages the machines that kind

00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:55,020
of thing so not much imaging going

00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:57,510
around like I said we store everything

00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:00,479
on the network or at least it as much as

00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:03,290
possible we store our scripts we have

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,800
roaming profiles and home directories

00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:09,320
one of our key philosophies is

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,240
workstations and servers are disposable

00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:14,100
by that I mean I can walk into someone's

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,520
office and so long as they're not

00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:20,430
storing data on the local drive which

00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,050
some do but if they're not then I can

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,720
take that workstation throw it out the

00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:27,450
window put another one in pop in the

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,750
boot disk wait a while and they're back

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:32,940
up and running or they can just you know

00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,130
the machines down walk to the next

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:37,950
office walk outside walk into a computer

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:41,130
lab start working their files are there

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,099
they didn't lose anything something

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,810
that's really kind of interesting even

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,670
on our file servers we treat them as

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:51,330
kind of disposable which seems a bit

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:54,300
weird the primary disk is disposable we

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:57,630
do not like to store a persistent data

00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:59,459
on this the primary system disk so what

00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:03,150
that allows me to do is if a server is

00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:05,100
active a server is just so messed up

00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,440
that it I can't get it to boot or I

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,089
can't get something to work all right

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,839
boot it off the network run the

00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:15,570
Installer clobber the system disk

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:19,200
company's backup it's good and then it's

00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:21,510
in fact since I install doesn't touch

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,450
the secondary tertiary and extra discs I

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:27,390
actually didn't lose any user data so

00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:30,780
it's been this weird scenario where I've

00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:32,310
actually rebuilt a production you know

00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,220
it's been down but of production

00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:37,710
server ducting up he's got user data on

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,390
it we build it 30 minutes later it's

00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:42,090
back up and working I didn't have to

00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:47,130
back up I didn't have to restore so

00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:49,830
that's a pretty cool thing I think so we

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,650
do offer remote access to all of our

00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:55,380
constituents all the way from freshman

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:58,080
all the way up to researchers and grad

00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:01,650
students and PhD students so currently

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:04,110
we have 10 servers these are some dell

00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:07,890
rackmount servers they have roughly

00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,930
about eight cores each 16 threads some a

00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:13,140
little less like 64 gigs but the best

00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:15,360
ones have 96 gigs of RAM for our future

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:19,230
we're going to two servers and those

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:23,339
have eight cores 64 threads and 256

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:26,910
gigabytes of RAM so we offer both remote

00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:30,230
and graphical SSH access and that's

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:32,820
actually more of a remote desktop style

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,700
environment and what that does is that

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:39,210
offers us kind of a virtual lab type

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,060
scenario now right now today we're we

00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:45,630
use free and x4 the graphical desktop

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:48,660
and that's available over all over the

00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:51,240
world globally accessible SSH but we're

00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,220
looking to go behind the VPN at some

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,620
point pretty soon because our security

00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:58,530
guys don't like that and I you know I

00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:02,540
get you lots and lots of fail domain

00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:05,640
emails every day as you can imagine and

00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,260
free and X is no longer really supported

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,380
or maintained so we're looking going at

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:14,490
xrdp as our remote graphical solution

00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,310
and interesting thing is we don't have

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:20,600
very many Linux labs so we this is

00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,190
actually used on-site and off-site so

00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,230
with people need to use Linux the heck

00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,959
should go to a Windows machine and a lab

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,779
they fire up our DP or they fire up the

00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:32,310
NX client and then they connect o

00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:35,339
graphical desktop and they do all their

00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,380
computing and that works fairly well as

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,050
long as they don't have to plug in

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,820
hardware

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,550
so current automation like I said is a

00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,410
kickstart automated installation we're

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:51,390
actually running masterless CF engine

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:53,610
with AFS to distribute the files we used

00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:56,370
quite a few scripts a mixture of bosch

00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:59,190
power Perl and Python so see if engine

00:11:56,370 --> 00:12:02,430
is the coordinator that kind of runs on

00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,890
every machine it copies down files does

00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:07,860
things and then it will install the cron

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:11,580
jobs or which run programs or directly

00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:14,270
run programs which will help get the

00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:16,530
machine into the into the desired state

00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:18,660
we use get for our version control

00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,550
system and for moving code changes

00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:23,490
between the different environments

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,310
between dev tests and prod so that's

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,770
mainly just you you do each developer

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,230
has their own repo once they're done

00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:32,430
they commit they pushed testing and then

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,980
from testing we can push to production

00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:36,510
and we can take different machines and

00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,670
can move them between the different

00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:44,790
environments fairly easily it's just a

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:48,510
flag file that we have to touch for rpms

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,060
and packages we use a just folders of

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:55,890
RPM sitting in a FS these are actually

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,030
distinct and separated from get I'd like

00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:59,220
to improve that a little bit in the

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,070
future but we can release those

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:05,700
independently for our future platform

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:07,590
we're going to go to Red Hat 7 and we're

00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,050
looking to use red hat satellite which

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:12,300
brings us with puppet which I'm looking

00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,340
forward to that also includes gatillo

00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:16,980
foreman and pulp as are all rolled in

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,420
the satellite this has the advantage

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:21,570
that we have these lifecycle

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,810
environments now so we can use our

00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:27,290
puppet code and our packages actually

00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:29,850
roll out as a unit they're no longer

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:31,350
managing the penalty and we can keep

00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,470
them together so we have the same

00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,180
snapshot and it's going to be looking

00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,710
forward to saying we have a nice life

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,720
cycle environment that goes from dev to

00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:42,360
test the prod and keep those coordinated

00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,860
the content views are used to

00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,100
synchronize the puppet modules and the

00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,050
RPMs which is nice and our one of our

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,089
key goals is to reduce the dependency on

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:53,220
a shared file system for our management

00:13:51,089 --> 00:13:56,069
tools so right now we're

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,660
everything running out of AFS you know

00:13:56,069 --> 00:14:01,170
everything is a script that just reads

00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,870
from AFS and AFS success accessible on

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:07,949
every machine and essentially that is

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:10,079
the message bus and the distribution

00:14:07,949 --> 00:14:12,240
mechanism for all of our scripts and all

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,430
of our machines so we're looking to be

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,540
couple that so we can have the option of

00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:20,730
moving to something else so ongoing

00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:23,670
challenges and how we've responded to

00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:26,370
them so we all have the usual suspects

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:27,779
budget and staff time so the way we tend

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:29,490
to deal with that is we automate and

00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:34,439
streamline things and that's works

00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:37,500
fairly well so far for example it does

00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:39,000
not hurt me in the least if someone says

00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,660
hey I want another workstation hey I

00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,769
want another cookie cutter web server

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,379
yeah I could go spin up another one of

00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:49,529
our production web servers no big deal I

00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:51,449
mean the hard part is it takes longer

00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:54,029
for me to go coordinate the DNS changes

00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,709
and the firewall changes with central IT

00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:59,389
than it does to actually get the server

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:01,949
up and running where it comes in the

00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,259
where it requires more time is when you

00:15:01,949 --> 00:15:05,370
start diverging you need configuration

00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,009
changes or something's that's

00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:11,819
drastically different from the one of

00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:13,709
our current builds so other things we do

00:15:11,819 --> 00:15:17,040
is we engage stakeholders to set the

00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,689
priorities because well you know all

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,370
right if you can't have everything what

00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,250
what is neat what do you need what do

00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:25,230
you give up you know just making sure

00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,660
that they understand that and pushing it

00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:29,610
back onto the faculty because there's

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,430
like hey I want everything like no no

00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:35,699
decide what you really need I'm not I

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:38,279
can't be the one in the IT team cannot

00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:40,680
be the ones to say oh this professor is

00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:41,670
more important this professors research

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,500
project is more important than

00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:45,209
professors know that's a business case

00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,360
that's a business level decision that we

00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:50,569
need to push back on them so we're

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,189
making some of some progress with that

00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:54,779
interns for some of the stuff I've been

00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:57,480
pleasantly surprised by some of the

00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:59,009
interns I've hired I have one of them in

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,550
the audience over here Thank You Daniel

00:15:59,009 --> 00:16:04,199
and some of them I they've got some of

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:05,850
my interns have been so good I've

00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,600
actually given them admin

00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:13,199
rights yeah they've had not just soo do

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,899
but you know can full admin like domain

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,870
level admin type rights in Linux you

00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:21,209
read everything you missed I picky and

00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:24,839
hundreds of machines go down kind of

00:16:21,209 --> 00:16:27,149
thing other challenges we've had we've

00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,449
had quite a good bit of growth twelve

00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:33,180
percent growth in the last five years so

00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:37,230
you know you hear on the news it's a big

00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,300
push about stem silent you we get the

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:41,519
responder receiving into that you know

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:43,920
everyone wants to be an engineer yay

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:50,759
please send us your send us yours your

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:52,649
kids will take good care of and the way

00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:55,079
we deal with that is we automate we try

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:58,410
to streamline set priorities like i said

00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:02,040
before something that's very interesting

00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,289
kind of a bit quixotic people don't

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:06,809
quite understand is we tended we

00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:09,809
actually tend to have a bimodal user

00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,400
population or if you look at the

00:17:09,809 --> 00:17:14,010
standard bell curve we're just really

00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:17,929
really stretched flat so we tend to have

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:23,220
both the early adopters and the

00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:25,470
Conservatives so on the same department

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,799
or possibly in the same professor it's

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:30,510
like all right I want program X to be

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,150
the latest and great why don't you have

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:34,830
the latest and greatest program x why

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:38,070
aren't you running the latest linux

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:41,549
kernel and then on the same token is

00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:44,340
wait we can't upgrade this program

00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:48,360
because the chip fabricator will not

00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:51,090
take anything newer I had a professor I

00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:53,490
kept basically emailing him and

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:55,770
screaming at him saying look you need to

00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,659
get off this program the vendors already

00:17:55,770 --> 00:18:00,000
given us the you know we're

00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:03,030
discontinuing it this is your last

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,010
license file you know license file will

00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:08,110
issue for this older version where's

00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:11,140
really serious this time

00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:14,200
and I can't blame the guy because he was

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:16,900
were relying on third-party libraries

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,720
that no one had updated yet so I think

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:23,080
they finally got it upgraded so it's

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:25,150
just a very interesting and both

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,440
rewarding about trying to deal with this

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:32,950
you know you've got latest and greatest

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:35,980
and conservative it's just interesting

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:38,070
so other ongoing challenges user want

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,990
users want root or sue to access

00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,910
especially the electrical engineers you

00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,010
know trying to do hardware development

00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:48,669
it without rude is kind of a buzzkill

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:49,960
and I get that so the way we address

00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:52,450
that is we do this through better

00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:57,640
customer service you know it's like hey

00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:59,620
I need this you know why it becomes a we

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,059
make it so easy for the professor look

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,400
we'll handle that for you we will

00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:06,970
upgrade the applications for you why

00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:10,360
should you spend your time managing or

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:12,640
administering a Linux system instead of

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,960
doing research or instead of doing

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:18,669
teaching and it it usually comes they

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,820
usually come around we make the managed

00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:24,040
offering almost irresistible and what

00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,480
tends to happen is we get new professors

00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,460
come in and the first thing they ask

00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,799
scores why can't I have my own box why

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,880
can't have my oh I want rude I want to

00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:35,049
do I want to install applications and

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,000
takes them about six months or a year

00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:39,340
and they finally kind of calm down was

00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,049
like I you know oh wait i actually have

00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:43,470
I don't have to worry about this it's

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,820
taken care of let me go do other stuff

00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:53,590
you know I let me go work on getting

00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:56,410
tenure but we do have people who don't

00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,840
you know for which the manage model does

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:01,030
not work well and for those people we

00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,320
set up standalone machine so those are

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:05,380
the same i managed or kind of the

00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,540
unmanaged machines where the grad

00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,309
student or the professor is the one

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:12,220
who's actually doing the administration

00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:14,380
and we we will help them but we have a

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,679
different hybrid team for that which

00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:20,140
I'll get into so in order to support

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,820
both the central people the management

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,310
desktops and thus my manage

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,610
tops with the distributed user model the

00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:29,380
laptops that kind of thing first off

00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:31,480
people can choose which one they want to

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:37,420
do we have professors who actually have

00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:39,400
one of each in their office and that you

00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,440
know granted one of those machines is

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,120
you know fairly new within three or four

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,760
years old the other is usually you know

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,960
five or six years old so it's not unless

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,590
they're buying the machine they're not

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,410
getting you know two new machines but we

00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:56,020
have a hybrid team we have a hyper team

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,700
that does kind of the laptop standard

00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,880
support and then we also have the

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,440
managed team which supports the

00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:07,870
centrally managed stuff and it's

00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:10,600
actually worked fairly well so as I said

00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,360
before we have you know the mixture the

00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:18,450
bimodal user populations so we have some

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:18,450
also divergent application requirements

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:26,140
so you have this application X wants

00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,700
this version of the library or one of

00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,070
the more interesting things is for

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,920
example console has to install a version

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:37,990
of matlab as a dependency and I actually

00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:39,750
had to instant we installed console and

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,550
then a slightly older version of matlab

00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:44,020
inside the same folder just for console

00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:46,990
and then we had the normal matlab

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,610
installation in a separate folder for

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:53,080
people who just just wanted to use

00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:54,940
matlab so we have this is when we do the

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,590
network applications our network

00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,180
installation so we typically have about

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,790
three two or three different ways to

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,010
install applications we have our pm's

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,930
for open source if we compile it or

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:07,570
install it from a vendor we're going to

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,970
install it on 2likes op CU e which is

00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,880
assembling into an AFS network shared

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,160
folder every application gets its own

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,050
folder and we try to install the

00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:19,420
applications into that folder along with

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:22,660
dependencies we have things called

00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:25,450
wrapper scripts which settle LD library

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,120
path just for that application so we're

00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,360
not polluting the entire namespace works

00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,059
out pretty well we can't but we can't

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,309
always fix this things like G Lib C

00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:39,379
I'm you know that's been a big deal as

00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:41,749
far as hey you know your g ellipses to

00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:44,210
all your on redhat 5 where we already

00:22:41,749 --> 00:22:46,789
have some applications that were no

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:48,499
longer upgrade like MATLAB you know I

00:22:46,789 --> 00:22:51,860
can't upgrade matlab until i go to a new

00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:53,120
version of red hat but that's not the

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,029
only thing that's had things like g

00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,379
lipsy dependencies that are too old or

00:22:56,029 --> 00:23:02,720
too new so I'm hoping it docker may be

00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:06,169
able to help with this but we haven't

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,240
gotten there yet one of the things it's

00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:10,369
kind of interesting is you know and many

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,110
businesses you have a corporate network

00:23:10,369 --> 00:23:16,580
and it's trusted and you know what's on

00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:21,679
there we don't I call it a semi trusted

00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:24,470
network it's like it's like a difference

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,299
between having your server somewhere in

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:29,330
Charlotte versus having your server

00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:32,059
somewhere you know out of the country so

00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,940
first off I assume that the attackers

00:23:32,059 --> 00:23:37,399
are already inside the firewall or even

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,039
inside the machines so I try to lock

00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:43,279
down the machines i mean i have grad

00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,499
students or undergrads who trying to

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:48,740
write a c-cup program and they you know

00:23:45,499 --> 00:23:51,049
made you ate at a scanf loop and all of

00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:55,039
a sudden you have a you know program in

00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:57,039
an infinite loop so through either not

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:00,289
necessarily malicious intent but

00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:02,749
accidental intent we have to monitor to

00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:04,369
this so we have to keep things running

00:24:02,749 --> 00:24:07,779
even though the users are trying to

00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:10,460
bring things down sometimes

00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:13,539
intentionally I run failed the ban on

00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,639
all my work stations all my servers and

00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:18,850
something I have to I'm really careful

00:24:16,639 --> 00:24:21,289
try to be careful about is wary of

00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:26,269
applications that little or no security

00:24:21,289 --> 00:24:29,299
as an example we have ipython well it

00:24:26,269 --> 00:24:33,440
uses zeromq so your room so your room Q

00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:35,570
has no bloody security if you run

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,929
ipython and you're on the same machine

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:41,389
you can you can know how you can go and

00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:43,850
read someone else's session thankfully

00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:47,350
ipython can put a little bit of security

00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:50,590
in there on top of zeromq

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:53,740
but we get we run into this mindset that

00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:56,830
oh you're on a you're one user and one

00:24:53,740 --> 00:25:01,600
machine no that doesn't that doesn't fly

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:03,610
I'm sorry I you know the taxpayers we

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,190
would just be laughed out if he said oh

00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:08,860
hey I you know I can't say that give

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:11,350
every researcher a 256 gigabyte of RAM

00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:16,150
machine I mean that's just not

00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:19,720
cost-effective so what I've noticed is

00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:22,030
kind of a an assumption even though

00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,820
we're using the we're back in the kind

00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:28,000
of the unix time sharing days linux does

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,470
that very well and what I find is

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,440
there's this kind of movement away from

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:34,480
that in the community saying oh hey oh

00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,429
now you're on the laptop your route you

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,380
know we try you're on a machine we trust

00:25:36,429 --> 00:25:41,980
you like no I can't do that that

00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:45,940
violates my core assumptions so that's a

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:47,950
sometimes I'm working against the

00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,679
vendors at the distros or they're

00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:53,500
working against me I guess that's a

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,620
another way to put it challenges yet to

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:58,840
be conquered research it's always a big

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:02,289
deal it's becoming more of a big deal

00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,280
especially with just trying to

00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:07,360
supplement get more research dollars in

00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:08,890
we have special requirements that

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,440
sometimes can't be handled by the

00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:13,360
managed offering and those are both from

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,600
security a security aspect and a

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,440
technical aspect so for example okay

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,600
yeah this application needs a newer

00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:24,789
version of the library that we don't

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:28,000
have on redhat 7 or we don't have run

00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:31,000
right at five so technically we can't

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,480
deal with you or security wise this

00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:36,809
thing is so hairy that you know we can't

00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,700
let anyone else login to the machine or

00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:43,390
this software has to be limited to you

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:47,429
know it can't be used by people who are

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:49,600
non US citizens stuff like that and

00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:51,370
we've gotten around a good chunk of that

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,460
but it's becoming more and more hairy

00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:55,850
and what's what's really frustrating is

00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,530
that

00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:59,480
you think okay just beefed up the

00:26:57,530 --> 00:27:03,919
security but that's not good enough

00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,750
because each research grant or each

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,850
funding institution has slightly

00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:10,160
different permutations of security

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:15,320
requirements so you can't necessarily

00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:17,240
satisfy both or multiple grants with

00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,970
they don't have a common set that you

00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,770
can say all right if I do a B and C I

00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:24,740
will be able to satisfy all these grants

00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:27,650
no they don't they don't match they

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:30,080
won't they aren't compatible so you end

00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,750
up with these forking these one-offs

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,970
okay this is for research grant a this

00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:37,419
is for research grant be because they

00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,690
have such divergent requirements and

00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:43,580
believe it or not federal agencies

00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:45,860
drastically different requirements even

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:48,580
not for the not for the you know not

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,870
even not DoD just you know some of the

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:53,480
you know the less sensitive stuff but

00:27:50,870 --> 00:28:00,679
they still had they they don't mesh it's

00:27:53,480 --> 00:28:02,059
weird so another big thing is storage we

00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,190
want more of it we want it for free

00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:09,530
that's it I'm not kidding when I say I

00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:11,450
have a faculty member and his research

00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:15,169
team they treat threat to 3 terabyte

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:17,270
hard drives like floppy disks I mean

00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:19,190
they have a little USB hard drive dock

00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:21,200
you two or three USB hard drive dogs

00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,840
connect to the workstations they just

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,830
they start swapping them out they have

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,830
you know Stockholm sitting on their desk

00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:33,220
security again you know kind of the you

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:36,140
know trying to keep the managed platform

00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,490
together and consistent without letting

00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:44,440
everything bifurcate and for because

00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:46,820
keeping avoiding the forks is how we are

00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:49,460
effective and how we leverage the

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,159
automation and how we can manage all

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,080
these machines the overhead of

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,600
management is not a function of how many

00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,080
machines were managing it's an overhead

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:03,289
of the function of how many different

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,299
configurations were managing I can make

00:29:03,289 --> 00:29:07,340
you know I can go fire up you know 100

00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:09,130
web servers if they're all the same

00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,770
cookie cutter config

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,050
no problem if they're all different you

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:17,110
no one's running up you know lamp stack

00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:22,270
the others running tomcat and the others

00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:26,950
running you know python that's when

00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:32,080
things start getting crazy and as far as

00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:36,070
security goes the core values of a

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,500
university our openness so we sometimes

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:40,060
are forced to be the software police and

00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,860
the security police and we sometimes

00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:47,680
have belligerent users sometimes very

00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,780
very well-funded users that you know

00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:52,840
they don't want to be under the

00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:57,160
constraints of these tighter security

00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:01,060
which we're bound by by either contract

00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:05,550
or regulation or conditions of the grant

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:09,240
or software licenses so we're both

00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:12,190
trying to serve the user and trying to

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,690
coerce them to play nice at the same

00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:21,070
time I guess it's been compared to being

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:23,890
a parent other things you know are we

00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:26,650
going to consolidate you know in order

00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:30,310
to be more efficient what services can

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:35,800
we shift to central ite what needs to

00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:38,290
remain in house these types of things so

00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:39,790
the future is uncertain for example

00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:42,570
we're looking to replace our network

00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:45,010
file system which is why we're trying to

00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:46,780
you know the couple all of our

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,090
management infrastructure from the

00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,890
network file system we're looking to

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,510
replace our user directory which you

00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,970
don't currently have one we have a

00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:57,850
password file that's distributed and

00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:01,090
then up pushed out into a Berkeley

00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,760
database you know what NSS DB is that's

00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:08,560
what we're using and our backup system

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,060
is in sore need of updating I was in the

00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:13,510
speaker's lounge yesterday and I said oh

00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,010
I'm going and rotating the tapes and

00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,050
even though I can do it remotely it's

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:18,400
like he's like and one of the other

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,100
speakers in their psyche you're still

00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:23,789
using tapes like yeah

00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,750
they're not even managed automatically

00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:29,770
other things we're looking at doing

00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:30,970
docker hey I'm really excited that hey

00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,820
maybe I'll be able to have these

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,470
multiple environments encapsulate the

00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,590
environment for every application so

00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:41,110
that we can have that newer G Lib C or

00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:45,760
that newer version of X library that

00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:48,010
needs to be done cloud amazon private

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,289
whatever you know how can we spin them

00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:56,350
up how can I have computing on demand

00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:57,700
wonderful stuff it's exciting and one of

00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,929
my personal favorites is continuous

00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:03,400
delivery trying to be better faster you

00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,929
know how can we automate this to

00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:07,630
automate a test make sure things are

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:10,240
working this is one of my personal goals

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:15,909
just to try to see are we getting better

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:18,850
I mean can we measure that so that's the

00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:30,760
end of the can talk so the other half of

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:32,110
this is questions discussions yes ok so

00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:36,340
how do we manage communication between

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:39,370
us and the users we have several things

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:41,830
first off you know personal contact you

00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,659
know i'm i have i've been in people's

00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:46,659
offices they call me directly but you

00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:48,789
know me directly i try to avoid the

00:32:46,659 --> 00:32:50,740
adoption problem where people always

00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:53,590
come to me I keep telling them go

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:56,440
contact the help desk I'm on vacation go

00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:58,299
to contact the help desk but no we

00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,120
seriously we have will send out

00:32:58,299 --> 00:33:04,270
broadcast emails through listservs we

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,890
have actually have a custom application

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:08,169
in the system tray on Windows and Linux

00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:11,530
that called the message of the day and

00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:13,900
when we have an import a an important

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:16,000
message that doesn't necessarily go over

00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,890
email because people they just have a

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,320
filter that oh it came from mosaic

00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:23,110
delete it they don't they don't read the

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,549
emails so we have a message program that

00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:26,200
comes up and the message comes up in

00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:29,559
their face which then they just promptly

00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:33,760
click go away but we have multiple ways

00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:34,960
you know we tell them you email them we

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,940
have a message pop

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,480
we'll go and talk to them if we need to

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,980
we try to be very approachable and one

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,710
of the things I try to do is I try to

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,539
maintain a relationship with some of the

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,510
researchers and some of my my linux

00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:51,250
power users to see you know what are you

00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:54,130
doing what are your pain points what do

00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:57,279
you need and by doing that and by

00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:00,370
engaging with our users you know it's

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,309
the concierge service model let me help

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:06,909
you what do you need and by maintaining

00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:09,339
that relationship I figure out I get you

00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:11,830
know these little tidbits of information

00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:14,020
oh you're doing this okay well here let

00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,869
me show you how to do this better and in

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:19,690
part in just having the conversation I

00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:21,580
find out that there's this thing coming

00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:25,440
out of left field and now I actually see

00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:29,020
it before I you before it hits me or

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,399
sometimes I you know that's when it's

00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:32,109
coming out of left field and that's when

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,270
it hits me but at least like all right

00:34:32,109 --> 00:34:37,179
we didn't know about this but we need to

00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:41,409
address this so at least I found out

00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:43,720
about it and we get things at all stages

00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,429
the pipeline you know we liked obviously

00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,679
we want to see things ahead of the curve

00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:50,530
we want to plan for it because you know

00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:52,379
we're booked six months out essentially

00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,240
or three months out for projects

00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:57,970
installing applications you know

00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:00,820
obviously users want things now you know

00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:03,849
oh my god and I can't exactly blame them

00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:07,089
I mean some of them some of it is yeah I

00:35:03,849 --> 00:35:09,700
was too busy others is uh yeah i was

00:35:07,089 --> 00:35:11,830
told lat you yesterday that i'm teaching

00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:14,560
this class in the fall and i need the

00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:17,320
software installed i have pity for those

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:21,160
people have pity for those seat for

00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:27,160
those but yeah just trying to maintain a

00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:30,839
relationship with my users yes we use a

00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,490
ticketing system we're looking we have a

00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:36,130
our own ticketing system separate from

00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:37,630
central IT central it's-- actually going

00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,810
to eat there looking at a new ticketing

00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,430
system so when that discussion comes

00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,180
around again we're going to look to see

00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:47,320
how we might integrate with that

00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:48,820
currently the ticketing the system

00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,110
migration discussion is

00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,410
hold because we're right in the middle

00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:55,660
of migrating everybody's email to gmail

00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:58,350
so that's the big priority just you know

00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:07,360
everything else just let it let it wait

00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:09,670
yes do we do asset management yes we

00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:13,510
have our own asset management called

00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:15,370
device DB and that actually does some

00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:16,690
asset management but in what it's really

00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:20,260
meant for is more of a configuration

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:23,680
management database kind of ish so our

00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:25,420
managed assets have to be in device to

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,550
be in fact for windows a windows machine

00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:31,330
will not build unless it's in the asset

00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:33,730
and lets in device DB as far as non

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,880
managed assets those get to be a little

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:41,950
trickier the university manages they

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,330
have assets inventory control tags and

00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:47,110
tracks anything over five thousand

00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:49,390
dollars purchase price but yeah so that

00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,340
that doesn't cover most of the pcs and

00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:55,090
servers so we're having to actually do

00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:57,460
our own tracking in some level and I'll

00:36:55,090 --> 00:37:00,040
be honest a good chunk of it probably

00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:03,600
goes under the radar but as far as the

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:06,220
managed platform it's a prerequisite for

00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:12,810
getting having actually to build a

00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:12,810
platform that it is in the database yes

00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:23,150
how do we

00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:25,010
the people with the the money makers

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,859
from saying replace everything with the

00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:34,310
windows because some of my money makers

00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:37,040
demand Linux that's I am I am now dub

00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:41,450
not I'm not to say that I'm immune to

00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,570
the windows everywhere a problem in fact

00:37:41,450 --> 00:37:46,310
the reason we don't have a dedicated

00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:49,580
publicly accessible linux lab is because

00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:50,780
there's not enough space it's not that

00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,780
there's not enough money there's not

00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,609
enough physical space there's a i like

00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:57,170
to call it the space wars going on you

00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:59,090
know we need a new building you know

00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:03,040
people are fighting over research space

00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:06,050
and grad student offices you know we and

00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,760
there's a big push up hey you we're

00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,290
making students bringing their required

00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,570
to bring a laptop why don't they have

00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:14,180
that why do we need to have Papa provide

00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:17,240
a workstation in a lab that we have to

00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:18,619
replace every four or five years when

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,290
they've got a laptop and they can run

00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:27,680
their software there so we've also got

00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:29,599
that challenge it does it brings up

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,910
licensing issues for students so you

00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,070
know some licensing is all over the map

00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:39,730
there's you know you think there'd be

00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:39,730
some standardization know you know

00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,730
you're correct if any if we had an

00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:03,680
open-source advisor in every University

00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:05,599
in every University adopted one open

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,849
source project we would have a lot of

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:13,430
good quality or better quality software

00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:16,660
I don't you know see what's what cuz

00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:19,700
sometimes comes out of a you know

00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:26,260
student coders and whatnot it I'll say

00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:26,260
better not necessarily good yes

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,100
not for authentication only okay so the

00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,050
question is do we use unix password

00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:37,690
files for authentication no we actually

00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:39,490
use kerberos the unix password file is

00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:41,680
simply distributed as kind of the user

00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,180
directory here's your account you here's

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,920
a list of accounts his a list of home

00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,740
directories here's a list of you IDs and

00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:50,680
G IDs that's how we use the password

00:39:47,740 --> 00:40:02,920
bomb distributed that answer your

00:39:50,680 --> 00:40:05,230
question uh we ok so we is the backend

00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,860
managed is the directory managed by

00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,300
central IT there is a central it8 active

00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,610
directory which is managed by them

00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,740
however we don't authenticate it against

00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,650
that currently we like to we're looking

00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:20,170
at that but that causes some interesting

00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,790
issues of hey you know there we're not

00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:24,370
mounting home directories off the

00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,920
central storage which is actually going

00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:30,520
to dropbox now so we that's kind of up

00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:33,730
in the air but no we're actually

00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:38,770
managing our own Kerberos realm that we

00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:41,290
use for authentication I believe you in

00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:57,970
the back did you have you your hands at

00:40:41,290 --> 00:41:00,340
Birth about you what are we conceal a

00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:06,760
sope AFS that's a good question that's

00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:08,800
that's oh you're welcome so what are we

00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:12,190
looking at to replace open AFS that's a

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,320
very good question and to your point as

00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:17,350
you said you know nothing quite matches

00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,410
the user experience of open AFS the

00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:24,180
strong authentication and authorization

00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:26,950
model I mean quite literally I can if

00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:28,150
one of my work stations is compromised

00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:31,120
if you have root on one of my work

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:33,490
stations that doesn't mean jack for open

00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:36,880
EFS you are an unauthenticated you're

00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:41,380
the anonymous user so you know unless

00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,840
the only way you compromised AFS from

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,250
that from a workstation perspect

00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,980
you have to go snoop someone's

00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:49,680
credentials or grab their tickets or

00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,900
tokens off the machine and then use that

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,430
to authenticate and even then you've

00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,420
only got the authentication or the

00:41:53,430 --> 00:42:00,030
authorization for that person so unless

00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:02,550
you happen to get in the admins machine

00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,440
you're not or one of something running a

00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:07,950
you know got some privilege to access

00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:11,400
one of our privilege machines you're not

00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:13,740
going to get very very far when I'm

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:15,960
looking at the different spaces you know

00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,060
if you look at FS v3 you know the

00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:20,640
acronym the joke is you know no freaking

00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,900
security and it scares me you know it's

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,520
no wonder our security guys just don't

00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,560
understand open FS I think oh my god you

00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,990
know this how can you do this you know

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:33,000
this they must think they were in kind

00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:35,550
of an NFS model where the client is

00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,100
enforcing the security no servers

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:41,040
enforcing the security things I'm

00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:43,230
looking to replace it my personal front

00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:45,690
runner is Gluster although in that

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:47,670
regard i'm looking at running it as just

00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:51,420
an like an i would be actually

00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:54,450
be mounting nfsv4 and then maybe some

00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:58,670
samba shares my boss has thrown out

00:42:54,450 --> 00:43:03,570
behind you know and netapp appliance

00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:06,750
whatever we do seems to be a step back

00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:09,660
or step down from the user experience in

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:11,730
the feature set of open FS but that

00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,470
seems to be where we're headed just

00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:20,520
because everything else integrates with

00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:22,800
SMB or nfsv4 and it's weird you know the

00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,810
programs don't tend to support this

00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,840
model of hey you can lose access to your

00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:30,120
files you know if you just if your login

00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,980
runs out you don't kick you out you just

00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:37,170
magically lose access to your files you

00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:43,740
can't write anymore and we're still

00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:45,180
looking I'll let you know but it's

00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:50,520
probably going to be something SMB or

00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:52,530
enough that's before based that's about

00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:54,890
where i am there you had a we got a

00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:54,890
question

00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:03,130
we aren't okay so are we moving home to

00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:07,300
draw box campus i T is looking at

00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:10,420
Dropbox as the storage essentially yeah

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:14,740
the home directory for central IT and

00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:16,360
mainly mainly the actually no was it was

00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,840
it the faculty and staff I was just the

00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,910
students that's right I only thought

00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,580
could be staff and student workers so

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:28,600
students have had this you know pittance

00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:33,010
of you know 200 Meg of a you know a

00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:34,000
network drive which is you know terrible

00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,310
and they're just saying you know what

00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:39,160
that we're not even going to pretend

00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:40,600
we're just going to get rid of it so

00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,060
they're saying look everyone's got

00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:48,580
laptops everybody's got thumb drives why

00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:51,130
fight it and how can we manage that you

00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:53,320
know when you know I you know I can't

00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:55,060
the permutations are endless saying okay

00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,460
where are you mounting your USB Drive

00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,370
how can you know how am I going to do

00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:04,840
that I can't suddenly manage profiles

00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:08,200
are not possible I mean it's you know I

00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:12,390
feel that we're going to almost end up

00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:15,280
keeping a network file system just for

00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:18,070
ensuring the level of service that we're

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,540
currently providing so that's a big

00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,880
challenge that we're currently wrestling

00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:23,950
with now we don't have the answer and

00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,320
what's interesting is that the we don't

00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:30,340
even it's not entirely clear what

00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:32,860
central IT is doing so since we're not

00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:34,690
even sure what they are doing we can't

00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:36,730
really decide yet until we know where

00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,380
they're going because they're with where

00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:40,560
their direction will determine what we

00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:40,560
do

00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:10,560
correct gmail g-drive Google yeah google

00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:12,150
drive and Microsoft SkyDrive or onedrive

00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,790
there they're great I mean they work

00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,620
well you can store files to them they

00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,360
just don't you know they're not a POSIX

00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:20,730
file system they're not something I can

00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:23,130
use as a home directory everyone's like

00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,560
oh hey its storage unlike know if I

00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:30,690
can't mount it and have it as a home a

00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:34,380
POSIX ish file system it's useless at

00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:36,210
least as a home directory so do we go to

00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,570
just the local disposable home

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:43,980
directories that seems like a it seems

00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:46,590
like almost like a disservice and to

00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:49,200
answer your to correct you everybody's

00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:52,320
going to gmail it's not backed faculty

00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,450
staff or going first I'm already my

00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:56,100
personal accounts already oh my my work

00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:59,310
emails already on gmail since I mighty

00:46:56,100 --> 00:47:05,040
I'm a early adopter and the whole

00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:07,140
college is moving on July fifth the rest

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,360
of the rest of the faculty staff will be

00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:10,860
done by the end of summer and shortly

00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:13,170
thereafter will get the students

00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:24,840
migrated over as well that's as I

00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:27,260
understand the plan is yes cool you're

00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,260
welcome you're welcome

00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:11,590
yeah you're right they be having the

00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:14,110
local solid-state drive typically is

00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:16,210
more performant than the network file

00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:18,730
storage or network appliance or what

00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,860
anything you throw at it you if you have

00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:24,100
to go over the network you you know the

00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:29,020
latency and about the i/o is just cut an

00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:31,720
order of magnitude I get that but the

00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:33,880
the advantage the selling point you give

00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:36,700
them is hey you know you've got back

00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,740
we've got backups you have a level of

00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,210
service you know you don't have to worry

00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:45,100
about copying the files to another

00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:46,960
machine and we do have complained so

00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,340
that you know AFS is slow because it's a

00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,310
network file system you know it's not

00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:57,370
going to be fast as local I'm not sure

00:48:53,310 --> 00:49:03,090
you the people don't really tell us what

00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:03,090
they you what they want sometimes

00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:59,470
okay so you've set it up so users can

00:49:56,109 --> 00:50:02,500
self-serve or you know a pre a white

00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:08,230
listed list of like young repos that

00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:10,270
kind of thing sure sure no that that's a

00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:12,520
that's a good comment that works well

00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:16,270
but that also assumes the one user one

00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,910
machine model so and for the most part

00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:21,160
if something is out an apple or some

00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,550
really quick rpm it's like hey you know

00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,220
it's fine and that usually isn't a big

00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:29,260
deal hey I need an RPM it's already here

00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:31,390
here goat install fine looks good you

00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:34,090
rolled out you know that afternoon or

00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:35,710
two days actually for most of our

00:50:34,090 --> 00:50:38,230
applications even some of the vendor

00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:39,460
stuff we can get it turned around you

00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:41,560
know if I've got a student worker who's

00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:43,869
training up to speed you they can turn

00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:47,560
around another than two or three days so

00:50:43,869 --> 00:50:48,850
it's not a challenge of all right I need

00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,820
this application we didn't usually

00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:54,850
upgrade those where it gets to is all

00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,859
right this application has these routes

00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:59,050
troubleshooting application of a it

00:50:56,859 --> 00:51:01,390
doesn't want to install it needs this

00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:03,490
version of the library but if the

00:51:01,390 --> 00:51:06,609
dependencies are already there then it's

00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:08,260
usually pretty good and if someone says

00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:14,740
hey I want like I said you know I want

00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:17,290
something from Apple fine yep done sure

00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:19,990
sure that that sounds pretty good I'd

00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:22,750
still have to get the you they wouldn't

00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:24,760
work for our compute servers and the

00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:27,310
remote debt their remote servers that

00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:31,470
everyone uses but a good suggestion

00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:31,470
thank you yes

00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:43,100
what software do we use for backups I

00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:45,020
wish I wish we used our site no no the

00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:47,960
software we use for backup is the

00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:50,420
builtin AFS backup suite that includes a

00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:53,660
command called back up and but see and

00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:56,900
it's also a series of and that actually

00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:59,170
is just the you know all that it

00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,670
basically doing a bunch of volume dumps

00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:04,040
directly to tape and there's a set of

00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:06,050
custom scripts I think we got originally

00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:09,680
from trans arc or some other university

00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:12,440
that manages kind of the process of oh

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:15,770
hey let's go fire this up so what

00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,570
happens is there's a scheduled job on

00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:20,060
all the file servers which does a

00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:22,820
snapshot at midnight which is actually

00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:26,210
very cool features because we have every

00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:28,730
user's account has a backup snapshot

00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:30,650
from midnight of the previous night so

00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:32,560
that cuts that down on a lot of backup

00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:37,070
request of oh my god it deleted my file

00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:39,380
so but that snapshot is then sent to

00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:42,580
tape it you know sometime during the

00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:44,960
morning or possibly late afternoon and

00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:47,300
we just have some custom scripts that

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,000
handle that and they'll go through and

00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:52,250
are there marginally intelligent about

00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,150
oh hey i need to go fetch the next

00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:59,360
backup tape but i literally spent

00:52:56,150 --> 00:53:01,670
yesterday i have to we are hardware

00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,980
admin as a currently between hardware

00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:05,210
admins would usually handle this but

00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:07,940
i've been cross trained on it

00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:10,580
momentarily and i literally have to

00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:13,700
spend every friday because full backups

00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:16,130
occur on the weekends going in and label

00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:19,190
swapping making sure the tapes earn the

00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:22,070
right tapes are loaded with you know in

00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:24,470
the mdx command and then labeling the

00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:27,710
tapes to make sure that everything's

00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:30,800
good I've in a previous life I used

00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:34,610
Amanda that was awesome but the

00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:37,490
challenge is that since AFS is not

00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:39,860
exposed as a traditional file system you

00:53:37,490 --> 00:53:42,670
can't just say oh I've got this local

00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,960
folder I'm going to share that with AFS

00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:46,270
these

00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:49,119
ruk sure of if a storage is actually

00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:52,020
opaque so you have to use the built-in

00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:54,640
AFS tools in order to do a backup and

00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,640
not many backup tools are integrated

00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:59,650
with that your options are either

00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,530
there's you do it yourself with a custom

00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:06,609
tool there have been some various

00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:09,040
attempts at trying to add a support to

00:54:06,609 --> 00:54:12,520
one of the open source tools or you go

00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:17,530
with the single commercial vendor that

00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:33,070
cost an arm and a leg yes that answer

00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:37,570
your question good so what's your

00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:39,510
question or comment ah yeah yeah there

00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:42,810
are some tools like pocket pc that have

00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:46,750
kind of AFS support bolted on but it's

00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:55,240
maybe clute little kludgy definitely

00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:59,890
nothing mainstream yes do we test

00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:01,630
restores uh it's been a while since we

00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,330
actually did to do a full restore but we

00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:06,160
get a steady stream of hey can you

00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:09,940
restore this file from three months ago

00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:14,410
so from that regard we get testing done

00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:18,880
that way but the backups work in fact we

00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:20,440
had a we had a request someone who would

00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,200
left the university and then come back

00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:25,119
they had been gone long enough that

00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:28,480
their files were actually deleted off

00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:31,480
the file servers but they wanted to

00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:33,580
restore their previous file contents

00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:36,220
from like two or three years ago no it

00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:38,830
was two years ago just barely within the

00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:41,820
tape window so we actually had to go and

00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:51,040
restore that from thee you know the the

00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:53,920
cement end-of-semester dumps yeah

00:55:51,040 --> 00:56:03,730
it's not our debt they were they were

00:55:53,920 --> 00:56:06,070
placated yep why does it take so long I

00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:07,510
can install and what is one of these

00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:09,250
things take so long I can install an

00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:13,060
application on my laptop in 20 minutes

00:56:09,250 --> 00:56:15,580
what does it take you two months well

00:56:13,060 --> 00:56:17,920
because we're doing it on 1200 machines

00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:20,500
and we have to go write the script thing

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,150
you know it's my word if we actually had

00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:24,970
the young people running around and just

00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:30,010
installing everything ones into Z you'd

00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:31,840
have a wild-west inconsistent mess and

00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:33,760
say yeah and you're right some people

00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:37,870
would cheer for that hey just give me

00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:41,490
the admin access I'll do it yep yes yes

00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,490
you're not alone sir you're not alone

00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:49,260
yes mark how's the puppet migration um

00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:53,800
it's coming along we're actually doing

00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:55,090
as part soo we're going when we're going

00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:57,070
to red hat 7 we're actually trying to

00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:58,960
deploy off satellite and that includes

00:56:57,070 --> 00:57:01,600
the puppet modules so we're writing some

00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,770
of our stuff converting it to puppet

00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:09,940
modules it's coming along it's more a

00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:12,550
matter of oh thank you two minutes it's

00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,110
more a matter of just it's finding the

00:57:12,550 --> 00:57:18,040
time to get through and port some of the

00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:21,700
stuff squashing the bugs it's definitely

00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:23,260
interesting since we're not the ad we

00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,150
were running actually open source

00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:27,670
cotillo so we are then the admins well

00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:29,200
admins up with the satellite ish thing

00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:31,330
but we decided to go to the Red Hat

00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,430
satellite provided by central IT and

00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:35,830
that's interesting because we don't have

00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:38,350
full admin rights so we're always going

00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:40,960
and bugging the the linux admin over

00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:43,900
there hey can you can you give us the we

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,700
can't seem to do X or Y we need to get

00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,010
the right permissions and we're trying

00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:51,370
to figure out what are the actual name

00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:54,180
of the permissions we need we have time

00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:54,180
for one final question

00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:04,320
are their demands

00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:07,680
other distros yes the most common

00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:09,300
request is for a bun too and I'm not

00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:12,660
opposed to a bunt too i run it at home

00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:15,090
but the issue is that the engineering

00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:17,580
application vendors will not support

00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:20,400
anything but an enterprise linux distro

00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:21,840
and in fact they're often behind like

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,480
wait you're running with at seven i'm

00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,340
sorry we only support with at six i mean

00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:30,000
that's that's its kind of thing that we

00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:32,420
face so that's it and thank you very

00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,420
much

01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,370
you

01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:04,869
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

01:04:02,770 --> 01:04:07,930
you need to integrate manage and

01:04:04,869 --> 01:04:10,060
automate a virtual data center all on an

01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:12,460
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

01:04:10,060 --> 01:04:15,220
platform and at a third of the cost of

01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:16,900
other solutions but why even bother with

01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:19,090
virtualizing your server infrastructure

01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:21,040
in the first place well let's say you

01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:23,320
have a traditional one server to one

01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,360
application architecture but you're

01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,880
running out of resources and performance

01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:30,150
is suffering once you order new server

01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:33,040
hardware you'll wait for delivery

01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:35,890
configure it install your business

01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:38,680
application stage and test the server

01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:40,900
and finally add it to your production

01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:43,090
farm if you've been through this process

01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:45,580
before you know it can take weeks or

01:04:43,090 --> 01:04:47,440
even months you also know it's a

01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:49,420
manually intensive process that will

01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:52,750
burden your team every time you outgrow

01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:54,700
your current setup with a virtual server

01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:57,280
solution you could accomplish all of

01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:59,859
that in less than half a day server

01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,720
virtualization software separates the OS

01:04:59,859 --> 01:05:04,180
and application from the underlying

01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:06,310
server hardware and with multiple

01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:08,020
virtual machines on a single server you

01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:10,990
can use each of them to run different

01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:12,790
os's and applications this makes it

01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:14,590
possible to move your virtual machines

01:05:12,790 --> 01:05:16,660
from one piece of hardware to another

01:05:14,590 --> 01:05:18,910
whenever you want to maximize

01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,859
utilization simplify maintenance or

01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:23,200
recover from a hardware failure and

01:05:20,859 --> 01:05:26,530
without slowing down your applications

01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:29,200
or users clearly server virtualization

01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:32,200
provides big benefits and Citrix

01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,390
XenServer provides even more since it's

01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:36,220
built on an open platform xenserver

01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:38,530
plays well with your existing hardware

01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:40,869
storage systems and IT management

01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:42,700
software as well as with the industry's

01:05:40,869 --> 01:05:45,010
leading cloud service providers

01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:46,510
best of all you can get started by

01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:48,520
