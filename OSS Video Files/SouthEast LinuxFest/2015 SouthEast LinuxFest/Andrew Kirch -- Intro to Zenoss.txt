good afternoon I have Mandarin Kerch I

00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:10,559
am presenting the 5:15 p.m.

00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:10,980
intro to Zeno's here at southeast linux

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,710
fest

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,890
if this is not your scheduled flight you

00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:18,960
may wish to disembark now thank you

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,230
everybody for coming out it's been an

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,970
awesome show I want to thank xenos for

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:26,430
sending me this is my first time here

00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,230
I'd like to thank the tech guys for

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,679
doing a fantastic job the Google

00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,750
Hangouts thing is really cool so if

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,370
you're watching this it may be recorded

00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:40,440
you may also be watching this live on

00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:44,489
Google so you know hello to everyone so

00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,050
this is the introduction to xeno so what

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,230
is xenos and what do you really need to

00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,270
know to get started so it helps if

00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,010
you're a systems administrator and it

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,289
helps to be that if for no other reason

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,629
then that you have something to monitor

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:01,770
we are a network monitoring and

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:03,840
management product so that is a basic

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,700
prerequisite and at a minimum it does

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,460
help up the devices at least respond to

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,299
pick going from there it helps to know

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,890
some bosch python is awesome though

00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,250
getting less needed with each release

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,689
and if you understand the basic

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:23,700
technology of SNMP WMI win RM and how to

00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,479
generate News SSH keys that's also a

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,750
huge help

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,130
as Taurus Balrog will open NMS said

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,130
earlier ten years ago if you'd even

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,350
spell us a Tempe you get $100,000 a year

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,610
job so you know hopefully everybody has

00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,799
seen us at MP now I am Andrew Curtis I

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:43,259
said I am the community manager in

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,299
Tino's I've done lots of systems of

00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,290
network administration more of it than I

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,630
care to think about I've been in AI

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,000
before this I worked at a I was

00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:56,070
principal at a company that did asterisk

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,740
box deployments and custom solutions

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:01,110
based on asterisk before that I was

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,469
senior network administrator at a local

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:06,840
Internet service providers so that's you

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,610
know the last 10 years of my life I've

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,110
also done a lot of monitoring in that

00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,540
time I've used a product called Argos

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,610
which probably nobody has ever heard of

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,439
I've used a product called n central by

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,360
enable which probably nobody has ever

00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:21,299
heard of but it does in depth we got to

00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,870
in central people this is the first time

00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:29,730
ever how much fun is reinstalling all

00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,409
those problems when they break yeah but

00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:34,230
you still have to do it is it still like

00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,370
everyday you're having the reinstall ok

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,870
that's cool it's like when I was doing

00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,099
it was like two minutes times 10

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,310
machines every time you went out to a

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,049
site every day so that sound like that's

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,390
got better and of course xenos which is

00:02:43,049 --> 00:02:46,680
where I work today

00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,150
just to prove that I am a system

00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:51,389
administrator the worst thing that I

00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,720
ever broke was at a company that had an

00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:58,049
Amanda backup server and I had a an

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,510
arrant space in my RM RF and I

00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:02,400
accidentally deleted far and the reason

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,370
why that was the only bad directory I

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,180
could possibly have deleted is that bar

00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:11,340
had the library of what was on what tape

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,200
in the tape robot which means that we

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,980
had to manually go through the tapes to

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,079
find and bar and restore it I broke our

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,430
network in the only way fundamentally

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,319
that it could be broken and not be

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,319
easily recovered in like five minutes so

00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,519
we had to go through each tape iterate

00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:31,769
through until we found of our manually

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,889
untiring each tape in the tape robot it

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:36,690
took hours I cannot tell you how much

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:39,569
pizza and beer I bought as an apology

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:42,180
for that but it was a it was a simple

00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:44,280
one character typo and I didn't catch it

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,720
until I hit enter it's something that

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,510
should have taken half a second didn't

00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,930
come back and at that point I knew I had

00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,940
a problem in my life so what we're gonna

00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,739
cover here is why you might be here and

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,389
it's a story I tell about network

00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:01,940
monitoring and one that I've seen many

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,940
times in life it's a sad story

00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:07,290
y'see nose fixes that problem and why

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,459
you might probably want to use eNOS I

00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,650
assume that you're at least interested

00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,109
in Zeno since you here I'll do a

00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,159
demonstration of xenos trying to show

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,989
you how to get involved in the community

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,340
I'm the community manager so I got to do

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,349
at least something self-serve with my

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,340
talk I'll show you where to get it and

00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:22,530
of course the fun part which is

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,669
questions and answers and as I said

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,580
before the start of the Google hangout

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,169
unless you're on Google Hangouts whoever

00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,210
asks the best question based on the

00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:37,289
decision of the audience will get an

00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:40,330
orange dummy so this is the sad story

00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:42,819
you work at 90 company they got you some

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,740
neat stuff and you have to monitor it

00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:46,330
and it doesn't matter what it is I mean

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:48,310
we've listed possibilities it could be a

00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,860
database if it could be anything but you

00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:54,099
know it's crucial to the business you

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,680
have to monitor it and it's gonna die

00:04:54,099 --> 00:04:59,680
because everything that we do dies and

00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,930
it'll die in short order and you're

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,360
responsible for it you're gonna get

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,969
blamed when it dies and you're gonna get

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:08,909
doubly blank if you don't fix it quickly

00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:12,759
so it did die and you fix the problem

00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:17,020
you're the new IT guru you're a hero and

00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,669
now everything is your problem and and I

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,069
hear people snicker excited know they've

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:22,750
been through this so you realize that

00:05:21,069 --> 00:05:25,000
you need to monitor all this new stuff

00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,979
and you install something you found

00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,560
after searching Google could be open

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:31,930
source could be closed source could just

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:33,729
do pings you know it could be anything

00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,020
but hey you search bullets how we fix

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:39,729
all of our problems none of us know

00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:42,789
anything except for how to use Google so

00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:44,440
your boss comes in Monday morning we got

00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:48,580
this new app the marketing department

00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,349
needs it and he'd never heard of this

00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:51,759
before of course they didn't bother to

00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,919
tell you there's no vetting that was

00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,680
done by the IT department okay you get

00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,719
to monitor that now too and you go to

00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,529
your app that you downloaded from Google

00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:04,960
and it doesn't monitor it so you to play

00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:07,719
the app and you know bad things become

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,520
we all do you Google monitoring the new

00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:12,279
app because hey it worked the last time

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,629
and you get another monitoring product

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:18,039
and you install that as well and the

00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:19,270
other crashing you didn't know the

00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:20,830
reason why you didn't know was your new

00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,300
monitoring software also couldn't be

00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,490
monitored with your old monitoring

00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,379
software so your new monitoring software

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,879
crashed and then shortly after the app

00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:32,370
that your marketing department depends

00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:34,779
upon went down to and it's your fault

00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:37,040
again doesn't matter that you didn't

00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,570
better doesn't matter

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,920
she didn't get any time to figure out a

00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,920
monitoring so she what still your fault

00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,490
so now you're googling monitoring

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,750
software to monitor the two pieces of

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:52,520
monitoring software that you already

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:56,090
have installed all right this is done

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,980
the it's ridiculous and there has to be

00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,420
a better way I mean you're going to go

00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:01,880
through a number of iterations of this

00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:03,860
I've seen companies that have seven

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:08,120
different monitoring platforms deployed

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,010
to cover their entire network and yes

00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,420
this is a true story and it's not just

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:15,110
the true story once it's a true story

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:16,970
multiple times over because this is the

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,640
problem and there has to be a better way

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:23,030
to do this you have legacy hardware you

00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,370
have air mental servers you have public

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:27,350
and private cloud you have the software

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:29,930
that runs on those things you have all

00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,850
this stuff and maybe if you're really

00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:34,790
lucky multiple internet connections in

00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:36,290
BGP to monitor as well it's all fun and

00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:40,070
games until that goes down and then the

00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:42,350
whole company's dead so it's a really

00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:44,180
ugly situation in the modern IT

00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,160
landscape it's not like it was years ago

00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:48,260
you buy a server you install a server

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:52,220
the server sits there until the hardware

00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:53,750
dies it's elastic its on-demand and I've

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,780
even heard the docker guys refer to it

00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:58,670
as slash and burn IT we don't care about

00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:00,740
that server it's gonna be something else

00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:04,780
in five hours automatically well how do

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,850
you take care of that so she knows this

00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:09,800
concept is to take care of that doesn't

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,950
matter what it is we have a way to

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,650
monitor it give us because entropy is it

00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,900
going to speak WMI for windows we can do

00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,780
monitoring via SSH if you have a Cisco

00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:24,560
router juniper router that's because sha

00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:27,170
this of course well Linux BSD anything

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,080
that speaks snmpv2 live there's an IETF

00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:32,330
RFC that almost everyone who's ever used

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,940
SNMP has taken advantage of that may not

00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,570
know exists and it defines basic

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,310
components of just about everything and

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,870
most vendors are actually really good

00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,580
about using it so that means that a lot

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,920
of things out of the box that aren't

00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,870
super esoteric if you stick them

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,940
somewhere in the device hierarchy you're

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,660
going to get at least some of the snmpv2

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,240
bit

00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:57,920
which at least give you basic CPU memory

00:08:53,240 --> 00:09:01,640
disk swap and network interfaces so it's

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,080
a better start than nothing as I said we

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,550
support most major operating systems out

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,720
of the back up and there's tons of

00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:10,460
documentation now so to achieve that and

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,310
to be able to monitor everything there

00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:15,740
are Zen pass and Zen PACs are like the

00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:17,690
Nagios call some plugins but they are

00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,050
additions to the monitoring software you

00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:23,030
install put the device into the part of

00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,370
the tree that the Zen pack adds and hit

00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,490
remodel and it will go pick up all the

00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,680
new pieces of the hardware or software

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:33,620
that you want it to monitor and there's

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,010
everything from cloud AWS Windows Linux

00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,990
juniper and it's not just hardware and

00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,120
operating systems I recently wrote a Zen

00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,850
pack for postfix because I was unhappy

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,590
with the postfix monitoring options that

00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,960
were out in the wild so there's now a

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:50,480
really like super comprehensive postfix

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,070
then pack and the only other monitoring

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,720
software I found for postfix it was as

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:55,850
good as what I wrote in my spare time

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,490
was actually being sold as a commercial

00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:01,910
product for thousands of dollars

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:04,280
it's absolutely shameless so to install

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:08,530
zero score 5 just to get things off the

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:11,990
ground you're going to need a server

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:13,910
virtual real doesn't matter for cores

00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,080
they don't have to be particularly fast

00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,400
you just need a couple of them in

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:22,340
parallel 20 gig of ram and a minimal

00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,580
install of CentOS 7 or move on to 14 for

00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:27,170
yes you can make 12 for work it does

00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:30,050
take some work you have to forklift a

00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,050
kernel on to it and 14 for is out anyway

00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,180
so why not just go ahead and use it and

00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:37,670
yes you don't have to use an LTS version

00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:45,320
of Ubuntu but since we plan to be around

00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:48,980
we're going to yes I did typo that

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:53,150
didn't I so 14 for not 14 14 it's not a

00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,620
modem Thank You nitpicker and chief up

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:56,240
here who's giving me grief because I

00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,660
gave reasons before the beginning so I

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:01,310
did have that one coming and you can get

00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,020
it on the wiki it does take about an

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,840
hour to install it has to pull a bunch

00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,310
of docker if you

00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,440
and I'll show you how that works here in

00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,500
a second and it's all automated and

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,030
amazingly painless by the way if you do

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,480
try to install this at the last minute

00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,920
because your VirtualBox crashed five

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,540
minutes before you have to talk at the

00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,070
hotel it will still be installing while

00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,070
you're beginning your speech and it just

00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:26,130
barely finished a time I had that happen

00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:31,830
about a year and a half ago so let's get

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:36,560
to the demo as we okay how do I make you

00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:36,560
know indigent oh that works even better

00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,780
so that was fixing the issue that we had

00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:44,880
so this is control center and as I said

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:48,420
the new version software version 5 is

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,520
based on docker and docker as I

00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,020
mentioned earlier believes in what they

00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,670
call slash-and-burn IT nothing's

00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,860
permanent anymore everything's elastic

00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:58,740
and scales via run files - you know as

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:01,740
many reviews you need but there's not

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:03,090
really orchestration and if you have one

00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,590
thing that you're running in da core you

00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,850
have to do all the plumbing to hook up

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,740
the next thing that's running in docker

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,420
and that may or may not work as you're

00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,120
expanding and you're gonna spend eight

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,830
hours at a chef class to make it work by

00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,140
the way the chef class was over there

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,550
you missed it if you're sure so that's

00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,930
not gonna work so let me show you maybe

00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,930
there's something better than all of

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:24,210
that and what we've come up with is the

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,360
nose control center now see a nose

00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:29,490
control center allows you to export via

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:34,530
URL various pieces that you might be

00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,790
interested in so will we use open TS DB

00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,440
now for metrics if you want to get

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:39,180
directly to the open TS DB interface

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,400
right a custom report pull custom data

00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:45,030
out of open TS DB it's right there you

00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:46,230
absolutely can do that great for

00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,900
scripting great for hitting the things

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,840
you can also access HBase directly or go

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:55,620
to xenos five all the assignments

00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:57,360
everything that you need I can't make

00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,510
that fit unfortunately due to the

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,820
projector but I will kind of scroll

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:08,480
through all of this is automatically

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:10,560
coordinated and you can for instance say

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,280
well I'm running his own but I need a

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,280
couple more soaps

00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:20,129
so we'll add two more jokes so all this

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,240
can be done on the fly to adjust

00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:23,889
configuration and it will work across a

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,559
cluster which is something docker does

00:13:23,889 --> 00:13:28,029
not do natively so you can add control

00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,730
center slaves to the control center

00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:34,360
master and it will deploy either based

00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:37,059
on your specification of a resource pool

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,230
or it can automatically display to the

00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:41,559
resource pool that has the most

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:43,869
resources available and any dock any

00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:46,629
docker application that you have a run

00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:48,519
file for you can write a simple yeah

00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:49,959
Mille definition and it will be control

00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:51,759
set already so this is a completely

00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:54,970
separate product it's also open source

00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:56,470
under the Apache License so not only do

00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:59,559
we use this for orchestration you

00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:02,740
absolutely can as well so moving on to

00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:05,350
the product itself this is the xenos

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:06,459
dashboard and again we're going to do

00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,449
the best we can with the small

00:14:06,459 --> 00:14:10,509
resolution because we're actually

00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:13,480
designed for 1024 but life will go on

00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:14,999
so you see a couple of things here we're

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,429
closest that actually gives us the map

00:14:14,999 --> 00:14:22,029
so we have a map we can do location

00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:24,220
based monitoring the easiest way to

00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:25,959
explain that is that your third shift

00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:28,300
not monkey which breaks it half the

00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:29,980
thing that he touches doesn't need to

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,509
know about outages there in data centers

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,850
that he's not in because he's not smart

00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:36,970
enough to actually know where he is so

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:39,879
if you have a large NOC staff it makes

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,499
your life much easier you can get them

00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:43,449
accounts and drill them down just to the

00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:46,329
locations that they're at and just to

00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:48,399
the events that they care about allowing

00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:55,990
them to you know triage things they're

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:57,399
actually going to be able to fix I don't

00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,170
know why it does that that is like the

00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:04,839
default for Google Maps like it sticks

00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:06,279
me in the middle of Canada apparently

00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:11,129
thought I was going to be SD cam this

00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:11,129
week that's the only thing I can figure

00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:16,839
so first thing you do once you get

00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:18,399
online and look at the amazing Google

00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:19,569
map and say hey that's really pretty is

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,209
you're gonna want to add some devices

00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:24,579
and that's very easy we have an added

00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:25,899
device dialog and based on the device

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:28,340
class you can fill in the information

00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:31,020
you need for instance if you're in

00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:34,590
server Microsoft Windows it'll ask you

00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,360
for an Active Directory user name and

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:38,240
password and we do have documentation on

00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:42,630
making that least possible privilege so

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,850
that does not necessarily require global

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,010
admin rights to work so depending on

00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,620
what you're doing if it's SNMP it'll

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:52,380
give us an MP community if it's not it

00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:55,440
will give you username and password for

00:15:52,380 --> 00:16:03,090
SSH or let you specify key file it just

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:05,250
depends so let's go to I had one here I

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:08,310
don't that's a good basic so this is a

00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:10,560
dd-wrt router runs Linux runs SNMP and I

00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,840
mentioned snmpv2 mint standard earlier

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,430
so that makes it actually easy to get

00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:17,490
useful things like file system

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:18,930
information IP services this is all

00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,940
gotten automatically let me show you how

00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:27,390
that works in a second all the network

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:30,000
interfaces default routes and processor

00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:32,340
information and with all those you get

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,750
pretty I'm gonna be really sad if you

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:38,880
all can see these graphs anybody a

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:48,260
safari expert knows how to do like 50%

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:52,110
sale command - awesome you are my hero

00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:55,980
so the new graphs are all rendered in

00:16:52,110 --> 00:17:00,630
html5 on-demand they are as you can see

00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,800
interactive and they also can be if

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,430
you're doing like a custom one-off

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,250
report exported to CSV or provide a

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,290
direct link to the graph so you can do

00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:11,400
reporting both inside and out of cenotes

00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,930
that's a great way to write a quick

00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,500
dashboard applet if you need a specific

00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:19,110
graph on the dashboard so this is just

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:20,790
what snmpv2 MIT gets you none of this is

00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:24,000
enterprise monitoring at all this is

00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:25,380
just a standard that's a little more

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,220
complicated device to show you what you

00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:36,110
get with enterprise this is a Juniper

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,720
SRX 220 anybody here in a Cisco user

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,100
anybody here juniper users all right so

00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,820
there's a couple of you there is an

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,160
awesome

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,870
Zen pack Francisco called Cisco Midwich

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,450
supports every mid Cisco's ever written

00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,950
you do have to do kind of the custom

00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,120
definitions yourself saying I care about

00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,190
this I care about this I care about this

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,350
but all of them are there you click a

00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,120
button they all install for juniper

00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:59,040
users because it's June us and

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,720
everything is stable and standard and

00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,160
they all run the same software and

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,510
listen to that screen if that doesn't

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:09,270
count you have this awesome ability to

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,550
plug one xenpak in and with the

00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:14,550
exception of the SRX which has scipy SEC

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,530
firewalls which in case you put it in

00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:19,470
juniper firewall everything just goes in

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:22,410
juniper and it will completely enumerate

00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,980
every resource on the device down to the

00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:28,500
power supply's routing engines so you

00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,520
can get alerts it for fun if any

00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,810
component inside of that router fails

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:37,500
you also can get even though this

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:41,190
doesn't have any bgp session per session

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,840
on bgp and it doesn't have it built in

00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:46,910
but you could copy and paste to do per

00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:51,240
session on his is or procession on OSPF

00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:53,040
absolutely the next thing you're going

00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,120
to ask me of course is ipv6 support it

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:59,880
will be coming in 5.1 we had to wait for

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,710
docker which Intel version 1.5 did not

00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:08,280
support ipv6 so we are going to leverage

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:09,930
1.5 with the next major release and ipv6

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,840
should be non-issue for those monitoring

00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:17,610
and some ipv6 will work today it's just

00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,680
not quite as clean as we'd like so going

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:24,320
in here for inside GE for those at both

00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,320
juniper nomenclature this is your

00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:28,860
network throughput for your main main

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,450
internet connection and you can label

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:33,540
these and change these and do some

00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,340
arbitrary things with them so I've shown

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,990
you you know a Linux machine showing the

00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,550
Juniper machine I don't have any Windows

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:42,710
machines on my network for religious

00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:47,490
reasons I'm sure you can understand that

00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:50,130
but we do have an awesome Windows Zen

00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:52,080
pack which leverages win RM and win RS

00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:55,230
and if you're not familiar with those

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,770
Microsoft has as they tend to do decided

00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,270
in the middle of

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,720
it's white life that you just don't want

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:02,310
to support WMI anymore we're bored we're

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,680
gonna write a totally new thing and make

00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:06,510
you support it which they did and we did

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,900
and we are one of the few open-source

00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:13,100
products that fully LED fully leverages

00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:16,520
WMI across Active Directory mssql

00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:21,780
IIS god help you if you have to run that

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:23,970
Active Directory and Exchange so if

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,360
you're running Windows we've got you

00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:30,830
covered if you're running Windows and

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,830
you don't use eNOS just assume it's down

00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:36,260
it's usually the safe way to go I

00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,470
apologize I'm from the north so I find

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,660
it to be quite hot down here so I'm

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,330
drinking a little bit of water so events

00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,070
and I have one event I had to rebuild

00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:49,110
this system in a hurry on Wednesday and

00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,000
one of my shoes didn't model when you

00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:52,680
get an event that comes in there of

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,060
course prioritize buying what we think

00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,980
is this as a severity

00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,960
you can change that severity yourself

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:00,480
it's very simple to do I use what's

00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:03,510
gonna Python transform its EVT dot

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,920
severity equals whatever and it's all

00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:06,630
all that can be done in a totally

00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,190
arbitrary Python and you can pull just

00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:11,100
about any piece of the event out change

00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,860
it to whatever you want and then we move

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,970
into triggers and notifications because

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:18,060
we actually want to do something with

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,530
that and this is the machine I didn't

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:27,720
put the triggers of notifications on so

00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:28,890
awesome so we'll call that self 15-1 i'm

00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:32,960
sorry can't put a dash in there that's

00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:39,150
right cell 15

00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:40,650
so one of the really irritating things

00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,800
about network monitors because in my

00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:45,240
life i've been on call

00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,710
who's woke up at 3:00 a.m. because their

00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,980
network monitor went off and it wasn't

00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:53,010
something he even cared about okay I see

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,920
like at least a third okay so who is not

00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:58,200
raising their hand is lying okay I'm

00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,880
seeing like five more hands come up so

00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,230
about two-thirds of the room has been

00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,630
woke up in the middle of the night

00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:05,520
because her network monitor went off and

00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,770
it wasn't even something they cared

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,330
about or it was scheduled maintenance

00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,770
that's the better part hey they're

00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:14,620
scheduled maintenance tonight you're on

00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:15,940
call all of a sudden 18 things go down

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,410
you're calling your boss here we're just

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,070
over to data center doing scheduled

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,940
maintenance you didn't get that memo

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:26,530
sometimes you don't get the right cover

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:32,350
sheet on that TPS report so you can do

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:34,360
very very complex logic to generate

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,610
specific events that you care about and

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,200
you can throw a catch all in as well

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:59,710
that maybe doesn't escalate to the same

00:22:38,200 --> 00:23:02,520
people yes in that cool I'm sorry he's

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:03,850
got a blue question sheet there Oh

00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,670
certainly

00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:07,840
so he's saying that and this is this is

00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:11,080
like the most annoying thing in the

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,840
world so you've got multiple sites and

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,400
you've got a VPNs with a common cause of

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,500
this but the link between the two sites

00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,990
goes down but you're monitoring over and

00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:22,570
now you're getting you know a thousand

00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:25,150
events from the far end because you know

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:27,370
it can't recover us in a P data it can't

00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,250
recover W my data so every machine is

00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:32,110
throwing events there's he with that

00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:33,970
transform system that I mentioned just a

00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,320
few minutes ago you can put the IP

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:37,420
addresses of those various router

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,240
endpoints in and if it gets into MIT for

00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,830
those it will suppress everything behind

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:46,260
it takes a little bit of pro of Python

00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,260
you know 15 to 20 minutes per router and

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,690
we do have layer two graphing and the

00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,300
Python take to transform takes advantage

00:23:55,690 --> 00:24:00,550
of that it's just not really a feature

00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,890
that's on out of the box if you go to

00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,690
the wiki the example code in Python is

00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:07,120
there you basically just have to paste

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,590
that in and put the net block since you

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,090
don't care about if that routers down so

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,370
what it'll do is it'll say hey does this

00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:15,760
router claim it's down yeah okay

00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,350
suppress that event so all you have to

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,909
do is put the correct information in for

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:21,799
that router and you're good to go

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:23,749
and that that's pretty straightforward

00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:26,059
but you know any different piece that

00:24:23,749 --> 00:24:30,379
comes in the event we can make decisions

00:24:26,059 --> 00:24:32,869
based on down to and hey here's IP

00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:34,459
addresses so if the IP address is fine

00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:35,449
the router that the Python will have

00:24:34,459 --> 00:24:36,619
already taken care of it

00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:40,609
but you could also do some basic

00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:47,079
filtering there so let's say we'll do

00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:51,829
something simple here Verity severity

00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:54,889
equals I want to say greater than or

00:24:51,829 --> 00:24:56,719
equals I'm sorry very got that already

00:24:54,889 --> 00:25:09,109
below so let's do device production

00:24:56,719 --> 00:25:11,739
state equals production and you can fork

00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:19,399
these out and say and production state

00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:20,959
equals pre production and you can define

00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:23,479
custom production States as well so you

00:25:20,959 --> 00:25:24,889
could say you know I only care at 3 a.m.

00:25:23,479 --> 00:25:26,089
F at cease production states you don't

00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:27,769
want to know if a test system goes down

00:25:26,089 --> 00:25:30,079
to 3 M nobody cares we'll kick it over

00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:32,899
tomorrow morning so you know we've taken

00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:34,309
care of you there so we get these events

00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,929
what can we do is let's go over to the

00:25:34,309 --> 00:25:39,109
notification side and we will create a

00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:40,579
notification I'm gonna use a phrase here

00:25:39,109 --> 00:25:41,959
in a second that security people will

00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:45,409
cringe at it'll be the first time you've

00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:47,059
heard this phrase in a positive light so

00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:48,739
this is this is always folks I always

00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:59,089
can tell who is the security person in

00:25:48,739 --> 00:26:01,190
the room so I've created two

00:25:59,089 --> 00:26:03,379
notifications let's go to the one that's

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:07,339
gonna make everybody cringe first so I

00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:10,339
can take this notification that my

00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:12,999
trigger I already created to it and I

00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:15,409
can run an arbitrary remote command

00:26:12,999 --> 00:26:17,539
based on that trigger a notification as

00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:20,479
long as there's a keyless ssh key on the

00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:22,729
network monitoring system so i can take

00:26:20,479 --> 00:26:27,619
this and say hey the apache server on

00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:29,809
this machine died restarting ok second

00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,909
time around count to three start third

00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:33,199
time around count three okay now i'm

00:26:31,909 --> 00:26:33,770
going to email somebody so you can do

00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:35,720
escalade

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,570
by a venkat it's a very simple way to do

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,500
escalation in the event of a problem you

00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:41,990
know it's five minutes between

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,690
monitoring cycles so or whatever is

00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:47,360
defined in your system but we can do

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:50,570
basic remediation of Damon's being down

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,980
or of other conditions based entirely on

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,050
what you want to program and this is

00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:57,010
also a great time by the way to hook

00:26:54,050 --> 00:27:05,630
into the puppet or chef by rest api's

00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:08,000
question in the back so the question is

00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:10,040
can you run commands on Linux machines

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,770
or on Windows machines or is it just

00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,180
Linux so first of all I want to say that

00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,310
there that that's a false dichotomy

00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:17,840
there's also routers and all sorts of

00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,880
networking equipment that could take SSH

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,440
logins and yes you can run remote

00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,750
commands on those the answer your

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,790
question can you do this on Windows with

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:27,860
win RM you can because the other piece

00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:30,260
of win RM is win RS which is remote

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:33,130
shell and that would allow you to log in

00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:37,460
and say kick over a system level service

00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:38,900
or even reboot the entire box or I'm

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,310
sure that there's a way to kick it with

00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,840
a correct command that would cause the

00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:47,030
machine to just shut down and install a

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:49,130
bunch of so that would be the best

00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:51,200
option if possible that you know I do

00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:54,830
understand that there are times when you

00:27:51,200 --> 00:28:08,110
just can't write about you or sent us

00:27:54,830 --> 00:28:10,880
yes another question in the back so

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:13,370
logging is a slightly larger question

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,860
but there's absolutely no reason the

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:18,560
question was can you copy the logs off

00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,690
before you take an action and yes

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:22,850
absolutely you can there's absolutely no

00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:24,290
reason why you can't SCP log files would

00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:27,110
look like they might be relevant to the

00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:30,800
error before doing that again password

00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:35,510
password less SSH keys are awesome and

00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:39,650
can accomplish many things but my real

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:44,110
answer to that would be remote syslog or

00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:45,770
products like a Splunk or log stash

00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,330
elasticsearch cabaña

00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,940
gray log our

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:51,710
your friends and there's another good

00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:54,770
reason to use us which is that xenos has

00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:57,860
a syslog consumer and you can run all of

00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,630
your system logging into Splunk

00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,740
elasticsearch log stash cabana or gray

00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:05,740
log and send only events that you care

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:08,270
about jizeen assists log out of that and

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,470
be able to generate alerts and have all

00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,970
those alerts in the single pane of glass

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,370
and have those alerts actually tell

00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:16,670
somebody that we care

00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:18,530
any alert that comes in from from a

00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,360
syslog source you can again run Python

00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:23,720
transforms in to provide additional

00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:25,250
context and enrich the event to give the

00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,810
person that's giving that event at 3m

00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:30,830
something more useful than a snippet of

00:29:26,810 --> 00:29:34,520
a lock file so any other questions

00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:37,310
before I move on once twice moving on

00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,630
excellent so back to the PowerPoint

00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:44,420
presentation I've pretty much covered

00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:51,410
this reports are basic reporting written

00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:53,630
in it's it's a it's a scripting language

00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,280
for soap and it's just completely

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:57,170
skipped me and I apologize for that but

00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,510
there are plenty of pre-programmed

00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:00,920
resorts reports and many Zen packs

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,120
already come with the necessary

00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,280
reporting built yet

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,290
so if you're running Windows there are

00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,970
already windows that are already windows

00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:10,640
reports built in to xenpak same with

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:13,880
juniper the same with almost any of the

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,260
communities and packs that should make

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:20,170
it much easier and as I mentioned I

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:26,240
api's earlier we do have a REST API that

00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:28,340
can be hid that uses JSON and that's

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,030
documented so if for instance you're

00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:34,880
provisioning a device in chef or I even

00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:37,040
have a full CMDB and you're putting the

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,870
device into the inventory for the DB and

00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:40,280
telling him to do this chef you can also

00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:43,070
spit into

00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:45,680
Zeno's hey this is the Linux server it

00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:47,720
runs Apache hey this is the Linux server

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:49,970
it runs my sequel now you'll have to

00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,500
have the credentials in here but that's

00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:55,000
pretty simple and straightforward and

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:58,370
automated and you can keep those in sync

00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,950
especially useful if you're doing on

00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:02,460
demand

00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:05,769
you know adding varnish cache is adding

00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,289
webserver is adding sequel databases to

00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:10,600
the cluster on-demand tool of balance if

00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:13,720
you have an environment like that with

00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:17,080
the modelling setup we can spin things

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:18,399
up and down in real time on demand let

00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,409
me go to one more piece on that say I

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:25,690
did kind of gloss over this and I

00:31:20,409 --> 00:31:27,519
promised I would show it so I'm betting

00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:32,440
I get no hands on this has anybody ever

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:35,080
used clear or less so clear OS is

00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:41,429
awesome it's basically Red Hat I will

00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:45,639
set to us with a web UI on the front and

00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:47,200
DNS DHCP anything you need on the LAN

00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,940
almost a complete small business server

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,260
replacement running Linux I've used the

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,929
daylights out of this thing for over a

00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:56,889
decade it is awesome

00:31:52,929 --> 00:31:58,659
so monitoring it we have all these

00:31:56,889 --> 00:32:01,330
components here well how do we find out

00:31:58,659 --> 00:32:03,159
about those so the way that we find out

00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:08,889
about those is that this is that xenos

00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:09,309
will log in via SSH and it takes there

00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:11,559
we go

00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:13,539
and it will get into them into the

00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:15,340
system here and I'm gonna show you like

00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:17,649
the one most useful tip I'm going to

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:19,029
break his rule and step off camera just

00:32:17,649 --> 00:32:21,549
long enough to point to something for

00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:24,549
everybody that's in the room when you

00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:27,070
run a model it's just a lot out saying

00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:29,169
hey you collected all these things and

00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,669
let's say that you've made a change to

00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:36,250
the device for something you've added

00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:38,039
more RAM rebuilt the raid array kinda

00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,929
change the basic components with this

00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:43,299
look for this line she dances notation

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:45,850
figuration detectable what you'll look

00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:47,889
for will be though that your changes and

00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:50,620
take the mutable sections concretion

00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:53,799
applied so having that changes in

00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:55,510
configuration applied basically tells

00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:57,100
you hey this thing that I did I can

00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,669
probably go back into my components and

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,139
now it'll be there just to give you an

00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:04,720
idea of what you get from and it will

00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:06,130
refresh with the new components and to

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,529
give me an idea of what you get from

00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:11,879
their full CPU metrics

00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:16,109
memory match

00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:17,519
it's monitored swap files I think this

00:33:16,109 --> 00:33:20,609
is SSH and we're still going to have the

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,289
Ethernet bug and we are so if it's not

00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:26,879
if it's SNMP you will get graph data on

00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:29,339
network interfaces if it's SSH you want

00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:33,529
that should be fixed shortly that was a

00:33:29,339 --> 00:33:38,219
bug that crept in at five file systems

00:33:33,529 --> 00:33:39,899
block utilization inode utilization so

00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:44,759
it gives you an idea of of your disk

00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:46,829
usage OS processes I noticed that it's

00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:48,869
running Apache so it will immediately

00:33:46,829 --> 00:33:51,119
pull out httpd you can also add an

00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:52,799
Apaches impact to get further Apache

00:33:51,119 --> 00:34:03,049
information if Apache is running mod

00:33:52,799 --> 00:34:05,069
stats question No so already tool I

00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:08,940
can't see anything better so the

00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:12,569
question was where do the files where's

00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,859
the backend for the grass I I don't want

00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:16,169
to trash talk already

00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:17,700
I've used are earning for so long I have

00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:19,109
nothing but love for Tobias he's an

00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:23,190
awesome guy if you ever get to meet him

00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:26,339
but our Rd tool in an enterprise scaling

00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:28,409
application is severely i/o intensive

00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:31,349
because of the way it writes to the RRD

00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:34,319
file it puts a line at the end and

00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:37,829
shifts everything back and that's a lot

00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:41,159
of writes and reads we've switched to

00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:46,049
open TS DB which is a time series

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:48,539
database and we use Redis for the

00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:51,419
initial data point collection and

00:34:48,539 --> 00:35:02,759
caching and then that will send the data

00:34:51,419 --> 00:35:05,700
on to HBase and populated open TST B to

00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:06,539
completely rip off a Pixar movie to

00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:08,069
infinity and beyond

00:35:06,539 --> 00:35:10,349
the question was what will it scale to

00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:13,170
if you keep throwing hardware at it it

00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:15,059
will keep scaling it is almost because

00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,410
it's big data it's almost perfect

00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:17,880
horizontal storage it's the same

00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:21,690
technology that Google uses for

00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,230
horizontal scaling I mean it will scale

00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:28,200
to Google I keep getting them

00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:30,390
just to prove it well and as I said yo

00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:33,180
hey you can add more jokes on demand in

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:35,609
control SEC you can do that with other

00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,180
pieces as well they meaning more Zen hub

00:35:35,609 --> 00:35:42,090
workers maybe anymore sent jobs so those

00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,550
pieces you can add additional workers as

00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:45,900
needed and as I showed you earlier with

00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:47,609
the control center you can say hey this

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,280
goes on the specific piece of hardware

00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:54,000
so if you had a million Windows machines

00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:56,220
I I feel bad for you I've got 99

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,810
problems and none of them were that but

00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,150
if you have a million Windows machines

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:01,560
you can put the Windows collector you

00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,140
can put python collector which is the

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,760
back end for win RM when RS on its own

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:12,690
dedicated hardware so that it will scale

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,850
so it just either we don't have other

00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:17,670
than like an absurd event storm like

00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:18,990
billions of events somehow happened we

00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,440
don't have a scenario where the product

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:25,590
can't keep up unless he hit a bug or

00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,450
something as far as scaling it really

00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:30,450
well scale to just about anything you

00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:34,170
might need questions before I move back

00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:43,020
to the PowerPoint I guess you guys

00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:45,180
really like PowerPoint so the C knows

00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:46,680
has an active support community and

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,780
something I always mentioned I didn't

00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:52,200
mention thus far is everything I've

00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,000
shown you is open source the everything

00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:56,280
I've shown you besides the junipers NPAC

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,680
is developed by xenos the junipers MPAC

00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:05,990
was developed by a community member and

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:09,510
it is an awesome xenpak it's also GPL so

00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:11,310
you can get you know the vast majority

00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:15,090
if not everything that's on your network

00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:17,040
monitored using only open source so

00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,930
nothing I'm showing you is commercial

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,280
nothing I'm showing these can be license

00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:21,570
fee I'm not gonna reach in your back

00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:27,420
pocket on my way out and take your

00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:29,820
wallet I might better watch so you could

00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:32,790
get up we have a wiki which is

00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,450
maintained by the community on the wiki

00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:37,470
you have many things let's move on to

00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:39,359
the wiki slow before I start talking

00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:40,760
about it so first of all we have both

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,040
Dino's and community source

00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:45,420
documentation documentation it's always

00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,520
been difficult to keep up with the main

00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:51,210
product and we've enlisted the community

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,400
to help us there we also have the xenpak

00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:55,710
catalog that has over four hundred seven

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,369
packs I'm assuming he's chuckling see

00:37:55,710 --> 00:38:01,530
SEMA learning curve picture I love using

00:37:59,369 --> 00:38:03,000
this picture of it any enterprise piece

00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,190
of software has a learning curve to go

00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,580
with it some of which are more esoteric

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:10,350
in shape than others but there are days

00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:13,950
where even I as an employee of see no

00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:15,690
system have felt like that and the nine

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:17,490
times out of ten when I'm struggling or

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:18,780
I've gotten stuck even as employee the

00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,070
answers already on the wiki and I just

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:23,040
wasn't looking in the right place

00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:26,369
so the wiki is an amazing amazing

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,810
resource it definitely you said that

00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:33,000
wasn't a question he was just snickering

00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:34,890
at me so we have tips for creating

00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,630
transforms and templates I discussed

00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:38,820
what transforms our earlier templates or

00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,280
the pieces that actually take data from

00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,920
a command SSH datasource or data from an

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,869
SNMP IDE and bring them into the product

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,109
and allow you to set thresholds allow

00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:51,660
you to generate events there they're the

00:38:49,109 --> 00:38:53,550
piece that's sitting behind what I was

00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,140
showing you earlier so there's a Linux

00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:59,760
template for Linux devices there's an

00:38:55,140 --> 00:39:01,440
SSH template for SSH devices and all you

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,850
have to do it's all point click creation

00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:06,900
in the UI it's very simple question

00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:09,390
looked like you had a question I'm sorry

00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:11,130
so development guide we have an

00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,780
extensive development guide in fact we

00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:14,550
have two we now have one for building

00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,010
his impact entirely from scratch which

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,260
is almost always not going to be needed

00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:22,260
but we have a new piece called Zen pack

00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,570
lip and Zen packed lib will allow you to

00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:28,080
take a simple and I believe it's a Hamel

00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:29,940
markup language file and it will take

00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:32,460
that markup file run it through xenpak

00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,770
Lib automatically when it loads into the

00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:37,140
product generate your templates generate

00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:38,640
your transforms generate the modelers we

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:40,020
sell modelers earlier silver generate

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:42,270
your modelers on the fly based on what's

00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,000
in the animal document it reamed leaves

00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,890
about 85 percent of the code necessary

00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,070
to create this impact all of that is

00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:50,660
done in the background for you now

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:55,640
additionally you can populate the

00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:57,620
components and add custom components we

00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,320
have extensive forms and they're very

00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:03,980
active there's usually you know 30 or 40

00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,840
posts a day on the forums so not only

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,510
are people asking questions they're also

00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:11,500
getting help I know I answer two or

00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:14,480
three hundred forum posts a quarter so

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,770
just depending on you know whether that

00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:17,180
question gets answered by community

00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:20,210
member first don't worry I'll get it if

00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:22,040
they'd all others he knows employees are

00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,290
on the forums contractors are on the

00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:26,990
forums and members of the community so

00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:28,970
if you had a custom xenpak it didn't

00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:30,800
want us to develop it for you we have a

00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,300
cottage industry of impact consultants

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,210
and contractors that are out there these

00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,650
impacts and the junipers impact was

00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,860
written by one of them their works is

00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:42,650
top-notch we also have a community blog

00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:45,410
so this is the only patent lie in my

00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:47,600
talk updated several times a month it

00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,910
would be if I had time honestly I do the

00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:52,820
best I can but that's a patent lie

00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,840
usually it's once a month hopefully

00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:56,180
that's going to change them we're gonna

00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,010
get some more blog posts but that also

00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,410
contains the demo our schedule Deb hours

00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:01,790
is awesome you get Encinos you got this

00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,070
one piece you can't monitor for some

00:41:01,790 --> 00:41:07,430
reason come to Deb hours we have

00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:10,370
developers who will get on IRC and our

00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:13,040
IRC channel it's xenos on IRC not free

00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:14,360
no net and they will spend an hour in

00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,580
the channel answering development

00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,650
questions that people may have whether

00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:22,520
it's a control center application you're

00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:26,450
trying to write or it's a xenpak lib

00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:29,330
issue or transforms and you're trying to

00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:31,190
write a transform or you can't get a

00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:31,400
template to work exactly how you want it

00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,560
to

00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,610
there are devs that are specialized in

00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,980
all of those on the subject matter

00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:40,850
rotates it's twice a week so it rotates

00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:42,440
each session and usually you'll see the

00:41:40,850 --> 00:41:44,930
same subject come up multiple times at a

00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:46,520
core so if you're wanting answers for

00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:52,040
your xenpak that is a great way to get

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:54,740
it onto IRC as I've already covered the

00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:57,560
dev hours IRC channel is very active

00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:59,030
there's usually 6,000 lines a chat a

00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:00,950
month that's several hundred lines of

00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,730
chat a day it's not busy when you're

00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:03,980
there

00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,140
you've got there at the wrong time but

00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:07,280
usually nine to five if you ask a

00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:09,859
question they'll have an answer within

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:11,390
10 to 15 minutes pretty straightforward

00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:13,790
Deborah says I said the schedule is

00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:17,630
posted quarterly and the schedule is on

00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:19,700
the never updated CMS blog so take a

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:21,440
look there and you will have a schedule

00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:24,800
that should help you find out when to

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,920
get to dev hours and it's IRC I'm not

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,780
taking pictures of text on screen so we

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,150
get to the last side this is the final

00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:35,240
questions slide there is a xeni to be

00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,830
awarded so first of all I want to thank

00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,450
everybody from self including the nice

00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:40,820
tech people don't even have questions

00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:43,600
and I'm gonna open it up to the floor if

00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:45,650
anybody has questions about xenos and

00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:54,290
whoever asks the best question at the

00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:57,440
end Getz's Eddie yes the Mac on the

00:42:54,290 --> 00:43:00,109
remote poster on the so the question is

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,780
system resources and how does it how do

00:43:00,109 --> 00:43:04,130
we compare as far as using them and

00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,590
there's a follow-up question that has to

00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:09,890
be asked here on the target the machine

00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:11,420
that you're monitoring or on our or

00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:13,090
resources for the monitoring software

00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:17,660
itself

00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:19,520
okay so Z gnosis agentless and that

00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:22,430
means that we put the load where it

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:24,109
should be we don't do we don't have a

00:43:22,430 --> 00:43:26,510
proprietary agent that sits on your

00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:28,790
remote host and chews up resources Linux

00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,410
you're gonna have SSH so we can already

00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,530
use SSH to the monitor and if it's a

00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:35,390
docker container we can already use SSH

00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:37,790
login to the vein docker host and pull

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:39,770
the metrics through docker for most

00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:41,510
things it's not quite as comprehensive

00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:43,730
as going into the OS but you know that's

00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:45,619
another option we don't put a

00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:48,140
proprietary monitoring agent on anything

00:43:45,619 --> 00:43:50,119
there's no for instance dodgy SNR PE or

00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,100
those enable probes that I was

00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:53,960
complaining about early knew that was

00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,210
coming I am so psyched that there's

00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:00,080
someone that was in my opinion here so

00:43:56,210 --> 00:44:01,400
psyched that was so awful and I'm not

00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,920
really bashing a competitor they do

00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,660
desktop monitoring they are excellent at

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,920
what they do but back in the day the

00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:10,760
purpose wouldn't stay install for more

00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:12,890
than five minutes so on your on your

00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,809
target the thing where you care about

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:18,589
resources we consume almost not

00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:21,019
on that to do a basic xenos install for

00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:23,539
CP of course 20 gigs of ram and a

00:44:21,019 --> 00:44:25,069
terabyte of hard disk should last you

00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:28,789
essentially for as long as you want to

00:44:25,069 --> 00:44:50,650
run version 5 next question

00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:52,880
yes so the question is MSP or

00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:54,949
multi-tenant I think really is the kind

00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,999
of the industry term for that and I give

00:44:54,949 --> 00:44:58,640
you the same answer and give this

00:44:55,999 --> 00:45:03,319
gentleman down here set up a VPN to each

00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:06,289
client and you may not be able to give

00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:07,669
them a portal I multi-tenant is it is a

00:45:06,289 --> 00:45:10,279
commercial feature so you can go that

00:45:07,669 --> 00:45:11,269
route if you want to but you know I'm

00:45:10,279 --> 00:45:14,949
just here to talk about the free

00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:17,539
software so you can do you know VPN to

00:45:14,949 --> 00:45:20,959
every client site generate reports for

00:45:17,539 --> 00:45:22,969
each client and you know be able to do

00:45:20,959 --> 00:45:24,769
per client site monitoring and with the

00:45:22,969 --> 00:45:27,079
transform I mentioned earlier for event

00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:28,609
behind a router suppression you

00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,589
shouldn't get hit with event storms

00:45:28,609 --> 00:45:34,969
if the VPN town collapses for instance

00:45:32,589 --> 00:45:40,009
so that that would be the easiest way to

00:45:34,969 --> 00:45:41,719
do it with version 5 that said I'm going

00:45:40,009 --> 00:45:44,599
to challenge the basis of your question

00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:47,589
I'm going to tell you why I had the same

00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,359
concern that you did and we started a

00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:52,069
challenge inside of it was kind of our

00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:53,659
solutions team was a gentleman named

00:45:52,069 --> 00:45:56,059
Eric Decker who says he knows master of

00:45:53,659 --> 00:46:00,019
myself who can find the cheapest machine

00:45:56,059 --> 00:46:01,429
on ebay that will run xenos I won one

00:46:00,019 --> 00:46:05,900
hundred and twenty five dollars plus

00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:09,969
shipping - it's an old dell poweredge

00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:14,509
- core 2 quad core Zeon's and 32 degree

00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:16,969
125 bucks so people look at that 20 gig

00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:20,119
of ram and the concept of hey this is

00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:22,759
like in my cloud stack or OpenStack or

00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:26,299
I'm gonna have to buy a $4,000 a month

00:46:22,759 --> 00:46:29,949
AWS instance if you want to just put it

00:46:26,299 --> 00:46:29,949
on bare metal bare metal still cheap

00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,640
that answer your question

00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:55,640
what can I still answer it could

00:46:52,340 --> 00:47:00,260
potentially not I'm the suggestion I

00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:02,420
would make it at that point is many to

00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:05,870
many NAT and I feel dirty making that

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:07,940
suggestion so I apologize awesome I

00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:10,700
it's not an ideal situation when you've

00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:13,010
got multiple RFC 1918 networks that have

00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:16,550
the same thrust space whether it's multi

00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:19,520
tethered or not next question I thought

00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,930
well yes I am a huge proponent of ipv6

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,370
and you need the solution to switch to

00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:28,310
ipv6 tomorrow

00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:33,250
arms out IP addresses far they have part

00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:36,410
of a slash 11 left so it's time to move

00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:38,000
there's eleven undecillion I believe it

00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,400
was I got to start come on too long it's

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:41,600
Gail love and undecillion ipv6 addresses

00:47:40,400 --> 00:48:05,600
we aren't running out of those anytime

00:47:41,600 --> 00:48:08,270
soon ah next question yes 5,000 might be

00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,070
pushing the core version but I do know

00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:12,410
people to do it if I was going to try to

00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:16,340
do it the first thing I would try is

00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:18,050
getting a couple of lower ends

00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:19,490
representing it I'm not pro services and

00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,110
there is a dead hours for this question

00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,490
so they may they may differ from my

00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:26,050
answers I get three or four of those

00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:29,750
small boxes and break out Hadoop

00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:33,230
breakout open TST break up my Moriah DB

00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:34,430
all on dedicated hardware and see if

00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:37,730
that wouldn't get you there because it

00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:39,590
ought to get you close and you'd want to

00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:41,859
crank up that hub workers and you'd want

00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:46,400
to crank up the sub instances

00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:48,619
but it probably will get you to 5,000 it

00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,730
will be close I'd be curious to find out

00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:51,260
what happened I'll give you a business

00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:52,760
card when I'm done just so I'll be

00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:57,859
curious to see if you get it to work but

00:48:52,760 --> 00:49:00,619
it shouldn't work did I actually repeat

00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:05,480
his question his question was on

00:49:00,619 --> 00:49:06,770
stealing the 5,000 posts see you don't

00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,270
even have to pick up your piece of paper

00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:17,150
anymore I'm getting good at this it's

00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:24,260
almost as if I'm being paid yes how

00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:26,750
about I'm sorry so the question is why

00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:29,030
not use socks5 instead of a VPN and the

00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:32,540
answer to that is and I don't know about

00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:36,410
SSH there's a lot of pieces I know win

00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,820
RM not gonna go over socks proxy so so

00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:41,210
you're probably being actually getting

00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:43,160
the protocols over the proxy I think

00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:47,330
you're heading down the road of creating

00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:49,040
more work than you're gonna solve my

00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:50,990
personal opinion get haven't tried it

00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,280
but knowing the product I think you

00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:54,400
probably going to create more work than

00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:56,840
your than you're probably going to solve

00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:01,730
so I wouldn't go that know the route of

00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:19,369
a socks proxy other questions the back

00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:21,560
yes that's correct there we would use a

00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:24,080
remote collector solution at the remote

00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:27,260
site the question was how does the

00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:30,590
enterprise product handle remote site

00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,030
and there's a UI piece and then there's

00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,740
remote collectors from those collectors

00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:35,230
get assigned to tenant I'm not

00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:37,700
completely familiar with that piece

00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:41,090
again I'm the community manager I only

00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:42,260
use the open source software so I want

00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,750
to be as fair a representative as

00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:46,460
possible and that would be another pay

00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,869
ask this question in the dev hours with

00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:54,520
professional services in doing a dev

00:50:47,869 --> 00:50:57,830
hours the I recovered that question

00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:06,200
don't confuse it myself so any other

00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:07,640
questions going once twice so my

00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,930
favorite question I'm gonna hopefully

00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,370
get a show of hands a degrees the

00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:15,050
gentleman in the back that asked about

00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:17,480
the running remote remedial commands on

00:51:15,050 --> 00:51:20,660
Windows host since when those doesn't do

00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,280
SSH that was my favorite question do

00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,300
they you look with everybody else go

00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:27,130
with that as being the most awesome

00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:29,300
question or we got two hands three hands

00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:33,260
so anybody have another question they

00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,580
like better all right with unanimous

00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:36,580
consent I'm gonna go ahead and end the

00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:40,400
talk thank everybody for being here

00:51:36,580 --> 00:51:41,270
thank you to self for having me I love

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,730
you down here

00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,290
you guys have done awesome and I'm gonna

00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,430
throw this any at the guy in the back I

00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:54,500
probably hit somebody three teachers up

00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:57,250
three chairs diagonal I was plus so

00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,250
thank you all very much

00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:38,590
yeah that's me would make the talk

00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:40,850
better if you'll speak SNMP absolutely

00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:42,200
and there should be there should be

00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:45,080
standard med Ben trees for tape

00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:50,180
libraries I wouldn't know I only break

00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:56,900
those well I broke the amanda tape

00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:58,670
archive that was a horrible horrible

00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:01,930
mistake which I promise will never ever

00:52:58,670 --> 00:53:01,930
happen again intelligence

00:53:03,570 --> 00:53:09,600
that was kind of what they did yes they

00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:09,600
started se peeing it to a remote machine

00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:16,890
like the director of IT looked looked at

00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:19,030
the thing after the Amanda Fiasco and

00:53:16,890 --> 00:54:35,440
just literally said you fundamentally

00:53:19,030 --> 00:54:37,540
brokenness and server gives you

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,360
everything you need to integrate manage

00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,490
and automate a virtual data center all

00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:44,830
on an enterprise class cloud proven

00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:47,320
virtual platform and at a third of the

00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:49,090
cost of other solutions but why even

00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:51,190
bother with virtualizing your server

00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:53,080
infrastructure in the first place well

00:54:51,190 --> 00:54:55,450
let's say you have a traditional one

00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:57,460
server to one application architecture

00:54:55,450 --> 00:55:00,160
but you're running out of resources and

00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:02,260
performance is suffering once you order

00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,590
new server hardware you'll wait for

00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:08,650
delivery configure it install your

00:55:05,590 --> 00:55:11,110
business application stage and test the

00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:13,540
server and finally mad at your

00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:15,490
production farm you've been through this

00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,160
process before you know it can take

00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:19,220
weeks

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:21,500
or even months manually intensive

00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:24,800
process that will burden your team every

00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:26,690
time you outgrow your current setup with

00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:28,760
a virtual server solution you could

00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:32,180
accomplish all of that in less than half

00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:34,160
a day virtualization software separates

00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:36,530
the OS and application from the

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,420
underlying server hardware and with

00:55:36,530 --> 00:55:40,520
multiple virtual machines on a single

00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,390
server you can use each of them to run

00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:44,060
different os's

00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:46,100
and applications this makes it possible

00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:47,870
to move your virtual machines from one

00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,050
piece of hardware to another whenever

00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:52,700
you want to maximize utilization

00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:54,980
simplify maintenance or recover from a

00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:57,830
hardware failure and without slowing

00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:00,050
down your applications or users clearly

00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:02,990
server virtualization provides big

00:56:00,050 --> 00:56:05,690
benefits and Citrix XenServer provides

00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:06,470
even more since its built on an open

00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,510
platform

00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:10,910
XenServer plays well with your existing

00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:13,250
hardware storage systems and IT

00:56:10,910 --> 00:56:14,780
management software as well as with the

00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:17,300
industry's leading cloud service

00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:18,860
providers best of all you can get

00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,840
started by downloading a fully

00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:23,840
functional production ready version of

Zen server for free after a 10-minute

00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:27,890
installation process you'll see how easy

00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:29,810
it is to start virtualizing your

00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:32,240
workloads and automating your IT

00:56:29,810 --> 00:56:33,680
management processes and when you're

00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,780
ready for a richer set of management

00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,240
tools just upgrade to one of the premium

00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:40,100
editions of Zen server so whether you're

00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,020
interested in virtualizing servers for

00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:44,330
the first time expanding your server

00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:45,980
virtualization footprint or moving

00:56:44,330 --> 00:56:48,650
server workloads to the cloud

00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:55,460
download and install XenServer today and

00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:58,120
see how it can help you do more don't

00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:58,120
spend more

00:57:38,610 --> 00:57:42,880
your customers rely on your website or

00:57:41,350 --> 00:57:45,250
application if it's slower

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,190
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:50,020
and costs you money keeping your

00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:53,220
business critical systems humming along

00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:55,840
requires insight into what they're doing

00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,790
your system metrics tells stories

00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:59,860
stories that can reveal performance

00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:02,140
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,550
other problems but how do you keep an

00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,340
eye on all of your systems performance

00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:09,100
metrics in real time and record this

00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,930
data for later analysis entered long

00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:13,270
view the new way to see what's really

00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:15,310
going on under the hood the longview

00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:17,380
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:19,810
of all your systems providing you with a

00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:23,200
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you
