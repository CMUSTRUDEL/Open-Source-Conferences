maybe why should you can understand the

00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,120
challenges around different cloud

00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:02,019
solutions of public private and hybrids

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,430
and you're going to look at the

00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:12,280
expectations you may want to look for go

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:13,840
over issues you can read the agenda so

00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,910
without further ado make myself look

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,300
stupid here we go so the first thing is

00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:23,800
everybody wants to share everyone wants

00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,770
to be able to have their files on all

00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:31,960
their devices we're in a very

00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:34,929
bring-your-own-device world so a lot of

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:38,950
companies have employees in various

00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:40,539
states countries where ever and we want

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:44,110
to be able to share that openly and

00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:46,450
easily to all of them well the issues

00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:50,380
with that is if your IT department

00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:51,819
doesn't like that you have a lot of kind

00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,590
of rogue employees and I'm guilty of

00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:58,030
doing it a couple of times in past

00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:59,140
positions where hello we can just throw

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:01,000
it on dropbox and share it with our

00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:04,899
department i want to ever know no biggie

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,349
no harm no foul well there is a harm in

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,569
a foul one you have no idea where those

00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:14,560
files are sure they're at Dropbox but

00:02:10,569 --> 00:02:17,970
where are they they say they're secured

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:23,940
you have no idea if they really are not

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:26,020
and it has a potential to jeopardize any

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,640
relationships with your other businesses

00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:32,860
that are other companies you're dealing

00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:35,290
with so the dangers of their shadow IT

00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,540
and you can see the garden predicted in

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,480
2017 chief marketing officer is going to

00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:44,650
spend more than I T are spend more on IT

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,510
than the CGI oh not good because they're

00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:47,860
going to be like what this looks pretty

00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,870
let's do it you have no security

00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:52,450
overview no one has any idea what's

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:55,930
going on the danger is going around IT

00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:58,840
is you have no idea if granted Dropbox's

00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,830
up a lot of the time but what if they're

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,580
not

00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:05,020
your files are gone do they archive in

00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:08,440
case something goes catastrophic Lee

00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,330
wrong how do you know your files aren't

00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,510
being accessed by everyone in the world

00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:16,630
brannad they say they're private but who

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,830
knows and what's their service level

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,730
agreement are they going to be up all

00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:22,860
the time are they going to have

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:28,560
maintenance this day that day whatever

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:31,030
we never had the recent survey from

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,820
Honam I always pronounce them wrong

00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,190
institute shows that more than half a 54

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,780
thousand respondents have sensitive and

00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:41,980
confidential data in their cloud and

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,130
thirty-nine percent believe moving data

00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:46,390
to clubs decrease their security posture

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:48,190
63 have admitted they don't have a clue

00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,550
what cloud providers are doing secure

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:53,459
their data and 35 have gone ahead and

00:03:51,550 --> 00:04:00,880
hand it over their encryption keys to

00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:03,459
the globe great idea you see it every

00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:07,630
day companies all over the world big

00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:10,140
small and different get for lack of a

00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,160
better term hacked breached our

00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:13,780
government just you did it and lost a

00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:19,410
bunch federal employees social security

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,410
numbers and information it happens yeah

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:25,330
it's nice my in-laws work for the

00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:30,820
government in the post office I'm sure

00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:32,260
they're really pleased about that so as

00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:38,470
you can see by our beautiful little

00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:45,479
graph pretty much everyone want I would

00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:50,080
love to where is it looks like speaker

00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:56,500
nope thank you that new button right

00:04:50,080 --> 00:05:01,500
there yes maybe yes thank you that was

00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:04,440
actually quite annoying yes much okay so

00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:07,330
you can see Biograph up pretty much

00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,810
everyone wants an on-premise enterprise

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:13,160
file sync and share solution the feature

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,560
are the focus being on on purpose

00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,630
they want to be able to touch their own

00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:22,900
files while being able to sync them to

00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:26,930
their phones tablets computers wherever

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,630
and the ones that don't honestly the

00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,550
ones that really don't know outweigh the

00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:36,170
ones that aren't interested whopping one

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:38,570
percent but whatever ninety-seven

00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:40,220
percent of cloud-based enterprise file

00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:49,400
sync and share users are interested in

00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:51,590
it in just that let's see ok so the non

00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:54,620
adopters even though they have not done

00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:58,370
it or have not found the perfect one if

00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,160
there ever is one you can see they're

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:02,570
still interested the ones that may not

00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,850
be interested at all or ones that have

00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:07,760
tried others that didn't do what they

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:11,150
wanted to or didn't integrate quite how

00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:13,940
they wanted with all of their single

00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:19,190
sign-on zor however they have their

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:20,750
infrastructure setup but you can see 61

00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,820
percent of non adopters would consider

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:28,430
if they have one on-premise and the

00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,410
factors behind that sorry as you can see

00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:35,210
I have no notes which were really kind

00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,800
on my version but the beauty of it is

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,500
you have flexibility control over works

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:41,660
or you know where it is if you want five

00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,970
servers you can provision five servers

00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:45,830
and they're all they're all your files

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:48,080
are right there someone shares it out

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,650
the place they want it's really bad in

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,540
car drive out it's yours you can

00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,720
leverage it with your on your existing

00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,220
on-premise applications so I really

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,390
can't think of a great example of this

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,520
but at the prior company I worked for

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,870
television network we had schedules that

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,660
were hard copies that we want to pass

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,310
around and we really needed a on-premise

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:11,720
bouncing so we just sync it between

00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:13,250
departments we somewhat used SharePoint

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,790
didn't really work all that well but

00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,919
that's what they chose which resulted in

00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:25,729
a lot of people using Dropbox or box or

00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:26,960
whatever the other factors driving their

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:28,520
interest is the

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,050
you can actually secure it you can put

00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,479
it behind your single sign-on behind

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:37,340
your firewall behind your ex yeah

00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:41,120
exactly your VPN whatever you want it

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,410
behind you can put it there and it gives

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,880
you control to comply with your

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,770
government regulations if you're in the

00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,990
healthcare industry or financial

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:56,349
industry or whatever because you control

00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:59,210
everything is again you can keep an act

00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:01,610
you can keep accessed it to data of

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,289
local copies to help migrate between to

00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:08,020
and fro if you roll up and you slaves

00:08:03,289 --> 00:08:08,020
whatever you send them over not an issue

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:15,229
and the types of data being prohibited

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,050
from being sure but stored by third

00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:20,360
parties is obviously your confidential

00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:21,440
data your financial stuff god forbid

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,539
you're storing that in a cloud but

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:30,259
whatever your regulated data records

00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:33,229
dealing with really anything company

00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,839
regulates could be upcoming products

00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:38,719
could be financial which is the next one

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,039
could be employee records which believe

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,279
it or not some people actually do storm

00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:47,390
cloud another one is your intellectual

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,860
property um the the final one is and

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,839
this is only ten percent of the time as

00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:53,690
some companies really don't care where

00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,870
you store things you can store anything

00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,760
you want anywhere you want I've seen

00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:02,990
people store complete database backups

00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:07,060
and Dropbox it happens and it kind of

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,060
makes you say what are you thinking but

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,450
actually they were is like this is gonna

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,360
be really easy to send it Bob over here

00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:22,070
I don't need to go around all these

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:23,690
hoops IT set up I've been that guy but

00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:25,940
you can see ninety percent of companies

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,089
prohibit some type of their data being

00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,649
stored in the cloud doesn't really

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:32,270
matter what it is but everyone has

00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:39,230
something they don't want out for

00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:40,810
everyone to see so most people have the

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:42,460
following adoption models

00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:45,520
you can go to your public cloud model

00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:48,880
which is dropbox box everything's in the

00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:52,180
clap you have no on-premise solution or

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,400
part of it well people got tired of that

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,560
so they rolled out a hybrid cloud model

00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,690
where the application itself is in the

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,640
cloud but some of your data is on

00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:06,190
premise then you get the on-premise

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:08,380
model which is what I'm actually trying

00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,690
to pitch here where everything's on

00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,970
premise you know where again everything

00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:15,190
is you can encrypt it your way you can

00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:18,820
integrate whatever you so choose to do

00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,890
and the remaining five percent don't let

00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,930
or too soon to tell or haven't looked at

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:28,330
it at all so the evolution of the cloud

00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:30,790
you we've had a public trial we've had a

00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:34,060
private cloud and now we're moving into

00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:36,430
a federated cloud which is kind of an

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:39,190
interesting topic so for a public cloud

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,420
its software as a service it's easy and

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,930
quick and you don't have to think about

00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,560
it you don't care it's just there the

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:50,830
bad getting too centralized you say you

00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,180
share with X well you can't

00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:53,830
automatically sync that over to Y

00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,760
without another third party that syncs

00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:59,530
between the two they may not be as fast

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,500
as you want granted they have tons of

00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:03,490
data centers all over the world but

00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,690
everyone's had a situation where they

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:06,490
don't have the best connection it would

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:10,510
really nice to have a hard copy on their

00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:13,930
machine the other limiting factor that I

00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,390
see a lot is cost other providers that I

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,890
can't name i'll top my head think it

00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,310
really really pricey when you start

00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:22,810
storing a lot of files there and the

00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,730
other issue is you've no idea where it

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,100
is like i said they have data centers

00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:29,500
all over the world it can be in europe

00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:31,390
dignity in germany it can be in the USA

00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:35,350
can be down mexico you have no idea it's

00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:37,029
somewhere and their proprietary so again

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:42,550
sharing with other providers you run

00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:44,110
into the issue of well can't and the

00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:46,510
remaining issue is back doors and

00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:48,490
security they say the secure but like i

00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:50,410
said everyone gets out at some point

00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:52,800
it's inevitable there is no perfect

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,800
security

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,290
so that brought in the private cloud

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,170
people got tired of these issues so they

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:04,980
want an on-premise cloud it was secure

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:09,959
yeah it's flexible as fast and you had

00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:12,480
no data silos but can't get it out it's

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,160
your private cloud on your premise you

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,149
have no way to share to someone on their

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:23,490
phone tablet desktop block that's for

00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:27,120
maybe a VPN but there's no this is not a

00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:28,920
panacea you were to learn interesting it

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,560
made collaboration and sharing between

00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,329
different organizations difficult

00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,010
because they had to use your VPN and if

00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:37,500
they're different company they have

00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,990
their own VPN pain the butt set up

00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,870
multiple ones and switch and whatever

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,149
and the users have to choose between the

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:50,760
convenience of off premise and security

00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:53,510
of flexibility of on-premise so that

00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,610
rings us to the hybrid cloud which is

00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:58,680
federated cloud essentially you have

00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,320
standalone clouds they can have

00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,459
individual policies and you can connect

00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,410
them directly for instant collaboration

00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:09,480
they have your on-premise clouds can

00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,699
talk securely with each other allowing

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,500
you to have like I said five six seven

00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:15,480
slave servers that all can communicate

00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:18,890
with master and sync each other they

00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,170
form essentially a cluster

00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:25,860
administrators can sure the choose what

00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:30,899
the store and host and where so say you

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:33,300
want financial records on server be over

00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,920
here that's all you want over there make

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,870
it happen so that way if something

00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:42,740
happens you have one central place you

00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:42,740
can go find your files for the users yep

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:52,740
yes it's coming for users everything is

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,699
transparent they have no idea that any

00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,920
of this is happening in the background

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,819
all there's folders and files that are

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,220
jumping through and getting what they

00:13:56,819 --> 00:14:00,959
want the last thing is security you can

00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,730
control it how you want it's behind your

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,390
stuff you can do whatever you want with

00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:09,830
it which is what everyone really wants

00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:12,980
so here comes a somewhat marketing

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,380
pitched the beauty of federated cloud

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:18,200
with a firewall on top of it is you can

00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:21,290
limit by type file path user group

00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,870
device location time blah etc it was fun

00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:26,390
actually wrote this so you can limit by

00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:29,030
a lot of things that may be really don't

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:32,660
need to or want to but whatever you have

00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:36,160
the ability mac address IP device type

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:38,150
if they're using a desktop client what

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,730
you have a lot of people really want to

00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:43,700
do that for some reason so the benefits

00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,350
and options of on-premise is you have

00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:46,910
security obviously you have your own

00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,050
access control your own authentication

00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:52,880
and your data is in your hands you can

00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:55,190
leverage whatever you have in house

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:59,660
we've integrated with cells for so we've

00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,890
integrated with sharepoint with a bunch

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,510
of other ones that i could not name if

00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:08,270
you had a gun to my head and we say

00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:11,570
reliability it's a reliable as your

00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:14,720
infrastructure is but if jours it's your

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,240
baby it's going to be reliable the other

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,530
beauty is at store jack not as agnostic

00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:21,140
we don't care if you have a raid 10

00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,370
allowed raid 5 we don't care if you're

00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:26,570
sitting on a little server in your

00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:28,520
closet we have no limitation of how big

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:32,720
how small and indifference you have to

00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:34,220
be and user adoption which really isn't

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,890
a big point as you can tell this is

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,130
prepared by marketing but users don't

00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:41,810
really care so much they're going to use

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:48,130
whatever you tell them or they're not

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:48,130
can't really control that do what

00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:59,200
exactly yeah well then they just boof

00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:01,820
their mac address do what they want um

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:03,920
and then you have convenience and

00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,390
compliance with your audits it's behind

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,860
your stuff you knew how it works you

00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,110
don't have to guess you don't have this

00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,880
gray area where you don't know what's

00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:12,080
really happening it's in the cloud I

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,730
don't really know what they're doing but

00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,730
I'm gonna say it safe

00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:23,689
now this is beautiful in here so users

00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:27,079
if you can read this nice little cluster

00:16:23,689 --> 00:16:28,279
of foolishness I demand comprehensive

00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:29,720
integration they want a mobile

00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:32,209
application they want a web application

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,160
they want to integrate you guys want

00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:36,709
integrate with your authentication you

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,499
want to work with any database you want

00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:42,169
to work with your storage devices sis up

00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,029
whatever so we integrate with iOS

00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:47,119
Android and pretty much any mobile

00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:48,999
device with a browser on eating manage

00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:53,029
documents collaborate with each other

00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:56,439
whatever we support ssl/tls aes-256

00:16:53,029 --> 00:16:58,850
encryption we actually do 512 now

00:16:56,439 --> 00:17:03,669
integrate with ldap Active Directory

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:12,130
sam'l Oracle MySQL ms sequel postgres

00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:16,579
SQLite yeah we're with your webdav your

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,709
CIFS your log managers and monitors we

00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:21,139
give file level forensics so you can see

00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,819
you know what's really going on what

00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:24,529
users doing when they're doing it why

00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,899
they're doing it and with support

00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:29,960
virtualization which in early a key

00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:31,370
point anyone does so here's the

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:35,389
marketing pitch that I have been told

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:37,279
i'm with own club you can access and

00:17:35,389 --> 00:17:39,730
share information across any device any

00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,159
time regardless where it's stored on

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:44,870
again big point years collaboration it's

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,809
stored wherever you want it but our

00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,610
users see or their files it's a white

00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:51,019
label you can brand it however you want

00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,730
you want your company logo on the top

00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:56,630
you want to dancing unicorn up there

00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:58,639
make it so and because it's hosted

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,490
locally IT can do what they need to do

00:17:58,639 --> 00:18:08,889
and do their job and make it as secure

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:11,779
or integrated as they need it to be and

00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:16,789
the federated cloud which is what your

00:18:11,779 --> 00:18:18,320
ass examples are actually next but the

00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:20,120
beauty of the Federated federated cloud

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,830
is you have your on-site storage stuff

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:25,580
you have your SharePoint your VMware

00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:27,290
your FTC your e mc2 your Windows Server

00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,480
block

00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:32,630
well with on cloud you can sync all of

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:34,340
that with all your users if they for

00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:37,490
whatever reason or if you so choose to

00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,160
allow it have your stuff on Amazon s3 or

00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:41,840
Dropbox or Google Drive or box or one of

00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,690
the other five trillion cloud storage

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,400
providers out there you can map those so

00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:49,040
that all they see is a directory they

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,980
have no idea if it's on s3 Dropbox drive

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:57,740
locally where it's all in one place they

00:18:51,980 --> 00:19:00,500
can see it and you can control it you

00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:02,440
have Universal file access so like I

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,390
said you can access it anywhere it is

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,220
with no regard of where it actually is

00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,620
you have a single point of control

00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,780
because the singular application pulls

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:13,430
everything in one place and you don't

00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,930
have to go jump to 50 things to change

00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:21,560
one policy Oh API so you integrate with

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:24,710
pretty much anything you want um sure we

00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:26,360
offer outbox integrations but if you

00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:31,310
want to integrate with some really

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:32,810
obscure thing do it and we provide

00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,970
multiple deployment options you can

00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:38,720
provide our we've seen people deploy to

00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:41,180
oh my god lower as berry pies and throw

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,640
them around um so pretty lightweight you

00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,680
put them pretty much anything I actually

00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,120
run ran a copy on my cell phone was

00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,120
developing somewhere in my computer died

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,310
and it's the only solution that I guess

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:57,560
we know of that delivers the benefits of

00:19:55,310 --> 00:20:00,650
open source and commercial the core of

00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,210
our product is open source on anyone can

00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:05,840
see what we're doing anyone can

00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:08,230
contribute assuming it passes are kind

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:10,870
of stringently annoying code reviews on

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:13,130
we have file firewall inspections and

00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:15,020
aren't that inspects your connections

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:18,650
and file action request so say you have

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:23,600
a user from X that you don't want access

00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:26,390
singing from Y from this location you

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:34,010
can make that happen and everything is

00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:36,080
logged no it's not at the network layer

00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:39,760
it's an instant the application layer

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,760
yes yeah

00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:50,770
uh private cloud is going to be on your

00:20:48,730 --> 00:21:00,820
server it's your own private cloud

00:20:50,770 --> 00:21:08,260
on-premise but what yeah it's what

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:10,570
everyone calls it so in action we have

00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:13,060
an IT industry research leader that uses

00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,650
own cloud to distribute strategic cell

00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,110
material on territory performance

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,640
metrics to its global field teams

00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:21,490
obviously I can't really say they're a

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,230
loud or I guess they would have put it

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:28,150
in the slide we were a very very large

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:30,220
religious company that's in Europe that

00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:32,260
I can't name but there's only one

00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:36,160
gigantic one over there so use your

00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:39,280
imagination that we store a lot of stuff

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,860
for um so they integrate with a lot of

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,800
different things they use sambal and a

00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,450
bunch of different technologies that

00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:50,530
really make our head hurt but the

00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:52,510
integrations are pretty painless um we

00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:55,230
have some manufacturing companies that

00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:58,390
want to give their executives access to

00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:01,810
sensitive data when they're out speaking

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:03,280
whatever they seem to be doing and we

00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,930
have some retail investment firms that

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:08,830
uses it to collaborate with their

00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:12,010
high-net-worth customers and now we've

00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:13,390
got some mail lists garment garner says

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,650
uncle out the good fit for companies

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:16,390
that want to run Enterprise file sync

00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:20,710
and share on premises keeping control

00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:22,240
and of and managing the system and their

00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,810
files leaving content on their current

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,340
location ESG says there's no longer

00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:29,200
one-size-fits-all world for enterprise

00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:31,000
syncing chair we're seeing companies

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
like on cloud emerge with on-premise and

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,570
hybrid options giving I key

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,730
organizations flexibility to choose

00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,250
where they did what they distort where

00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:41,230
and ability to leverage existing

00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,790
investments while supporting sinking

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:48,730
collaboration or requirements of mobile

00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:50,080
users the the whole hoopla this is leave

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,030
your data where it is you want to

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,570
provide a frictionless collaborative

00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:55,090
environment

00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:57,549
for all of your end users you want to be

00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:59,950
able to improve manage and control the

00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:02,380
visibility of these files and you want

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,970
integration with whatever you've got you

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,139
don't want to have to redo your entire

00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:09,700
infrastructure to add sink and cheering

00:23:07,139 --> 00:23:10,990
you want to meet the compliance from

00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,460
your higher-ups that jump on your back

00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:15,340
say well this isn't doing what we want

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:19,870
to do and everyone really wants to

00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,830
control their own destiny so that's it I

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:25,419
will try to answer any of your questions

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:30,269
I can as poorly as possible but at the

00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:30,269
end of my horribly steel

00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:46,010
we do not do client-side encryption at

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,360
the moment on we are you want to know if

00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,520
we supported it in to end encryption

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,810
since I kind of jump up and down on

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,100
security on with at the current moment

00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:57,680
no we don't do client-side encryption

00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,840
the encryption is all done server side

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,940
and you can actually control how it's

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,020
encrypted through a variety of layers

00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:07,130
you can actually implement your own

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,080
layer if you want but coming in actually

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:11,330
I believe the next version that we're

00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,850
investigating right now we are looking

00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:21,130
to add client-side encryption which is

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:21,130
kind of painful yes

00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:35,760
sorry could you repeat yes you can when

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,500
you're using a desktop client or a

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:42,059
mobile device or whatever you can set

00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:45,120
the URL if your master dictates it has

00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:48,390
to be HTTPS they have to use HTTPS it

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,690
will reject any access the non-secure

00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,690
channels

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:13,910
so you're asking if we have remote wipe

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:16,640
abilities yes um if you have a rogue

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,020
user on that side I'm gonna steal all

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,090
these company secrets and run away and

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,550
disconnect from your cloud yes when they

00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:26,060
disconnect from your cloud after X

00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:27,680
period of time it pretty much says hey

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:30,560
if you don't reconnect and sync again

00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,930
your stuffs going to disappear on you

00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,640
can dictate the window but how it sits

00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:36,740
right now if they don't connect it

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:46,280
leaves 10 or 30 days or whatever their

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:48,320
files disappear yeah um yes when you

00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:50,170
remove their what you can do then is

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,400
actually suspend their user account and

00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:57,430
they will have no access to anything

00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:57,430
even if it's local even if its local

00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:15,710
that yeah that I'm not sure that's a

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:17,600
good question I for the shortest timing

00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:21,410
set to expire you can set it actually to

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,000
anything you want arm you can actually

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:24,650
go two seconds I believe when go down to

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,370
think 30 seconds is the absolute minimum

00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:27,370
we can do

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:40,259
yes if the phones lost and the users are

00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:41,909
the phone is connected as soon as you

00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,220
open the application it calls home

00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:47,990
application says hey your accounts dead

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,990
and but you can't do anything

00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:14,590
so what do I think what you're asking is

00:27:09,019 --> 00:27:14,590
watch would use PHP since most gurus are

00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:29,950
okay so you're more comfortable would

00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:32,870
say Python or Ruby or anything but PHP

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:38,350
that seems to be the lack of a tour of

00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:41,750
the Guru perspective I really can't

00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:45,740
badmouth PHP since I'm a PHP developer

00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,500
um all i can say is PHP is changing a

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,350
lot um a lot of the dogma towards it

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:55,039
error for prior versions when it really

00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:58,610
sucked um but nowadays it's really come

00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:04,730
a long way um as far as why you should

00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:07,370
use us over Python or or C file um I

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:11,570
really can't give you as far as a

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:15,559
language itself a reason why but the

00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:19,039
product itself we provide more granular

00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:22,360
granular control we provide more

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,610
in-depth encryption on we provide

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:27,440
actually much more custom out

00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:29,179
customization because say you choose to

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,299
go with our enterprise application we

00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:34,700
have a team of consulting laws that will

00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:36,559
actually custom develop pretty much

00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:45,610
anything you want to make our

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:45,610
application fit into what you have yeah

00:28:47,409 --> 00:28:56,000
well to be to be honest the nudes kill

00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,679
about anything so yeah and that is a bad

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,539
thing about PHP is there's a lot of bad

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,789
information that people entering the

00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:04,100
world evelopment say oh this is really

00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:08,419
easy to pick up we'll pick the HP up now

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:10,220
when they read like w3schools or our w3c

00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:13,159
built schools and get all kinds of nice

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:16,720
security holes and injections and all

00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:16,720
sorts of foolishness and then yeah

00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:27,200
yeah yeah one of the biggest issues that

00:29:23,419 --> 00:29:32,809
people run into with PHP our SQL

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:36,200
injections yeah it's any language we use

00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:39,470
a very very very well known or RM called

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,909
doctrine on which pretty much converts

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,519
everything people prepared statement and

00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:45,259
makes it really easy for us even if even

00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,019
if we make a mistake and it passes our

00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:52,729
review process the ORM gives us another

00:29:48,019 --> 00:30:04,220
layer of say push it'll catch our

00:29:52,729 --> 00:30:08,499
mistakes a lot of the time um roadmap

00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:11,149
items that are really hot um let's see

00:30:08,499 --> 00:30:13,580
one of the new one of the new roadmap

00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:15,499
items that we've had a lot of I guess

00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:18,019
request for there's two that I can speak

00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:19,639
of one is encryption and these are two

00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,840
of the areas that I personally been

00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:23,659
involved in which is why I know about

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:25,849
them encryption a lot of people want and

00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:27,799
then encryption it's kind of a difficult

00:30:25,849 --> 00:30:29,929
issue to solve on our end but it is

00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,450
something we're looking to implement

00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:34,789
here in the short term on the other

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:37,399
being firewall a lot of people want to

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:42,109
be able to restrict access to a single

00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:43,849
folder for whatever reason if they're on

00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:45,169
if they're on an Android device I can't

00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:47,539
get into this folder I don't know why

00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:50,179
huge android fan but you know whatever

00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:52,369
um people want that ability at the

00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:57,769
moment firewall can't block a singular

00:30:52,369 --> 00:30:59,330
folder in next version I can not promise

00:30:57,769 --> 00:31:02,799
in the next version but in the very near

00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:02,799
future that ability is going to be there

00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:09,349
you can do file / 04 or folder level um

00:31:07,029 --> 00:31:12,109
first it's going to be folder level and

00:31:09,349 --> 00:31:15,580
then if customers market whatever

00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,580
dictates it will go down as a follow up

00:31:17,649 --> 00:31:24,470
but the issue we run into there is what

00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:28,210
if you rename holder what that yeah that

00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,210
that's the issue we're running into but

00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:39,730
anything else

00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:39,730
I am NOT

00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:49,220
in

00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:01,880
okay yeah okay yeah we actually uh

00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:04,160
enough sans bulb we have a like a

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,650
digital ocean single click install we

00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:11,420
have packages our packaging team they've

00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:13,910
got to be on crack yeah I get what

00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:16,550
you're saying I mean they publish to all

00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:18,950
the repositories on any linux distro out

00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:28,520
there so I couldn't tell you all the

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:36,680
things they deploy to of course someone

00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:39,440
brings up that huge de buckle yeah it's

00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:40,790
funny Lucas who was a big guy in there

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,920
that kind of got drug through the mud

00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:49,340
he's our chief security guy um I wasn't

00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:51,290
really a part of that whole d buckle but

00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:53,630
it's kind of interesting talking to him

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:56,870
he's like Oh check this link out and all

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,580
this controversy I honestly have no idea

00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,110
if we've got a new version out there or

00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:01,730
what they did I know they came to an

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:15,080
agreement but I could not tell you what

00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:18,770
it is yes yes at the moment I don't

00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:21,350
think we have any doctor or vagrant

00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:23,120
images out publicly available I could be

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,560
wrong again our packaging team deploys

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:30,430
or does all kinds of foolishness um oh

00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,430
yeah somebody's done it

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:48,530
anything else okay well I'm sure I'm

00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:48,530
early but thank yes

00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,210
you

00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:55,260
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:58,260
you need to integrate manage and

00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:00,390
automate a virtual data center all on an

00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,790
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:05,550
platform and at a third of the cost of

00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:07,230
other solutions but why even bother with

00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,420
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,369
in the first place well let's say you

00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,650
have a traditional one server to one

00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,690
application architecture but you're

00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,240
running out of resources and performance

00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:20,540
is suffering once you order new server

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,430
hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,280
configure it install your business

00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:29,069
application stage and test the server

00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,290
and finally add it to your production

00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:33,480
farm if you've been through this process

00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:35,970
before you know it can take weeks or

00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,829
even months you also know it's a

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:39,810
manually intensive process that will

00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:43,109
burden your team every time you outgrow

00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:45,089
your current setup with a virtual server

00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:47,670
solution you could accomplish all of

00:35:45,089 --> 00:35:50,250
that in less than half a day server

00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,050
virtualization software separates the OS

00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:54,480
and application from the underlying

00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:56,640
server hardware and with multiple

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,380
virtual machines on a single server you

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,319
can use each of them to run different

00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,119
os's and applications this makes it

00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:04,890
possible to move your virtual machines

00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,960
from one piece of hardware to another

00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:09,240
whenever you want to maximize

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,190
utilization simplify maintenance or

00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:13,520
recover from a hardware failure and

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:16,829
without slowing down your applications

00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,500
users clearly server virtualization

00:36:16,829 --> 00:36:22,530
provides big benefits and Citrix

00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:24,750
