alright

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,170
we're all here to talk about

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:20,720
documentation yeah the big fun thing

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,880
that everyone wants to do all the lis

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,460
all right reason why doc nation is very

00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,430
important it's useful to new users to

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,990
get around their new systems it's a

00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,739
great reference to even advanced users

00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:37,530
like us or some people less questions

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:45,170
for the mailing lists the rfcs and our

00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:49,469
forms currently our documentation are

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:51,770
quite fit over all over the place some

00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:55,260
that the octave on to manual is on the

00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:58,530
launch pad lubuntu manuals on launch pad

00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:01,950
as well but you want to know them is

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:05,220
still on the wiki there's no manual for

00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:09,119
it sip boon to our on help launch pad

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:13,200
and coping ducks are on user page user

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:19,170
base for the katie forms yeah it's also

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:23,010
a wiki these are the languages that all

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:26,700
the documentation czar in mediawiki for

00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:31,650
Kubuntu um one the boon to Xin docbook

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,659
we pontoon Lubuntu Xin latex lubuntu

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:38,430
based off of the bunch man oh that's why

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:43,460
they chose the same language this is

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:48,270
latex anybody familiar with a text

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:49,290
anybody want to learn latex then you're

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,400
probably gonna light the next slide

00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:56,399
better than restructure text it's a mock

00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:01,590
down type language do we like this

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:08,670
better it looks easier to learn right so

00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:11,489
why are we it's very similar layout I

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:14,250
just so I was picking restructure text

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:16,799
because of a back end call a Spinks doc

00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:20,269
that allows you to a user database to

00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:22,830
expert to HML prepare a site for you and

00:02:20,269 --> 00:02:25,720
allowing the CSS and HTML so you can

00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:28,210
edit and theme it as you see fit

00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:33,220
and stocks allows you to export to

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:34,960
ebook and a PDF so everyone can as a

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:40,150
users can gather the materials a lot

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:44,530
easier in different formats like I would

00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:49,030
just thought about HTML support PDF

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:51,370
ebook ebook version control I which

00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,150
taught about the CSS HTML you can easily

00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,410
edit there is support for github and

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,450
launch pad now has limited support of

00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:01,530
github yet as well so you could do both

00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,510
if you wish and they allow translation I

00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,220
was talking with the bun to docs people

00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,170
and they were looking into doing the

00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,590
researcher text as well and they've

00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,570
decided to use a instruction insulation

00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:15,130
guide as a core sample because it

00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,880
doesn't have really much translations on

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:20,740
it and we were looking at it actually

00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,410
uses the p.o files for translation

00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:27,940
sphinx does the same type that launchpad

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:33,820
uses so those translations won't go to

00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:38,080
waste so write documentation restructure

00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:40,570
text first proposal uploaded a launchpad

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,830
so everyone knows where they go all the

00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:44,950
I go to launch pad and look for their

00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:48,190
project that they're involved with the

00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:51,370
user can read the docs find bugs and

00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:57,430
file them on launch pad contributors can

00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:59,260
fix set bugs and we can export HTML from

00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:03,130
the stinks for project based websites

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:08,530
such as doc xubuntu or docs ash you bunt

00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:11,769
goob entry that we have it benefits one

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:13,690
language limits one or two languages so

00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:15,880
I was going to let the teams already

00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:20,080
heavily text stick with it they can use

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,489
hand doc if they want their it's just

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,700
too much docs for them to really change

00:04:21,489 --> 00:04:27,610
in human spec but there is a tool that

00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:31,900
you can use a pan docs to convert latex

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:34,180
to to restructure text so having one or

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,620
two languages versus all these will

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,770
limit incubi ability between our

00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,370
projects and will not allow a double

00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,220
work that

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,350
and as least as possible contributors

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,729
can easily just branch the project's

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,889
right off the launch pad rather than

00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:51,160
download HMO or something from the dot

00:04:47,889 --> 00:04:54,280
from the wiki they have easy asses to

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,280
the PDF & eBook formats for their

00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:59,290
respective formats and each project can

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,850
help each other much more efficiently

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:02,410
with having only one or two languages

00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:11,370
versus like three different wiki

00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:16,090
languages they most of their stuff is on

00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:21,160
user base for like a docu different

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:23,380
projects oh is it Lana a they're using

00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,729
mediawiki yeah we moved over there

00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:31,660
because I let us host on their servers

00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:36,070
and it's better than Mulan one it's a

00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:37,330
little bar yeah but be honest with you

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:47,919
that's actually the end of the side I

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:49,900
think and then i have my links yeah one

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,460
of this certainly one of those servers

00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:54,940
maintained errs was actually already

00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:57,760
moved some of it we're using panda to a

00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,280
github and researcher taxi just use pen

00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,570
off to convert all of them and they had

00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,220
a meeting the last meeting they were

00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:05,530
going to use the installation guide as

00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:08,710
example to try to restructure that in

00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,180
the researcher text we format and see

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,130
how that goes as we were looking in the

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:20,710
if translations how translations would

00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:23,889
be handled it's pretty good i converted

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:27,550
f refer to restructure text in the doc

00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:32,010
book and researcher text into x latex

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:32,010
and look spot on

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:46,490
I don't think so it's just more of the

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:48,590
benefits of learning curve for new users

00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:50,390
and contributors to documentation and if

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,250
you make it easier even for users I

00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,840
imagine developers have a much more

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:59,060
easier to write it and more willing to

00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,330
write it and better documentation any

00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,330
more questions

00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:18,599
thanks guys ensure guide as she has no

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,849
target right now I think it's just going

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:23,969
to be like a little back in fermentation

00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:27,689
for right now and then see if that works

00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:32,659
and then with what where we like three

00:07:27,689 --> 00:07:32,659
months or what is it for months of 1510

00:07:32,749 --> 00:07:37,699
now there's a documentation freeze I

00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:42,240
don't know the day I think it's close

00:07:37,699 --> 00:08:00,509
debian freeze Thank not sure you know

00:07:42,240 --> 00:08:05,550
there is a docket is it all right yeah

00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:08,490
it's not target 1604 that's LTS want to

00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:15,469
make sure everything good not on the

00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:18,979
long-term support it don't work you just

00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:18,979
yeah easily

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:35,760
and I know that's written in my mail in

00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:38,100
something I think no muses the way that

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,670
we do for Kubuntu is we've uploaded to

00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:45,960
user base KD page then it's a script

00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:48,000
exports it to doc book and then key help

00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:57,270
center imports the doc book file and

00:08:48,000 --> 00:09:11,580
that's how it's written yeah somewhere

00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:14,780
along those lines right documentation it

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:23,820
would be going on in the bun to dash doc

00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:26,960
IRC channel I don't think it directly as

00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,960
in which

00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:51,550
yeah I know on the HTM can't lowdown on

00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:54,670
this the HTML page thats pink slowed it

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:56,110
out it had a table content the way its

00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,300
formatting and everything you can just

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,000
import table contents whatever file you

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:03,820
want then put the stocks into their own

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,560
folder and organize things like that and

00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,790
then have images in their own folder and

00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:14,380
everything I haven't looked in the

00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:16,540
videos that might be up to the where you

00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:21,010
host them where you host the

00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:24,370
documentation like the Spinx will make a

00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,740
website locally in HTML made where you

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:35,500
host it you could embed it with videos

00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:37,660
in there I don't know if format that

00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,829
will support that own thang anything I

00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,089
don't think it's designed for that I

00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:42,089
know what can handle images

00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:59,949
for the export that Sphinx books out I

00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:01,779
did not mess around the CSS but I know

00:10:59,949 --> 00:11:03,699
it gives you all the defeats all the

00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:04,810
pages in the HTML so I don't see why you

00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:08,940
couldn't just edit and move things

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,940
around you just put hiss here

00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,160
you

00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,190
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,190
you need to integrate manage and

00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:48,320
automate a virtual data center all on an

00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,720
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,480
platform and at a third of the cost of

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,160
other solutions but why even bother with

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,320
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,300
in the first place well let's say you

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,579
have a traditional one server to one

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:03,620
application architecture but you're

00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:06,170
running out of resources and performance

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,470
is suffering once you order new server

00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:11,360
hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:14,240
configure it install your business

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,000
application stage and test the server

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:19,220
and finally add it to your production

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,410
farm if you've been through this process

00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:23,899
before you know it can take weeks or

00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:25,760
even months you also know it's a

00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,740
manually intensive process that will

00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,040
burden your team every time you outgrow

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,810
your current setup with a virtual server

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,600
solution you could accomplish all of

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:38,180
that in less than half a day server

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,010
virtualization software separates the OS

00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,440
and application from the underlying

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:44,570
server hardware and with multiple

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,310
virtual machines on a single server you

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,310
can use each of them to run different

00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,050
os's and applications this makes it

00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,820
possible to move your virtual machines

00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:54,890
from one piece of hardware to another

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,170
whenever you want to maximize

00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:59,120
utilization simplify maintenance or

00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,829
recover from a hardware failure and
