ok good afternoon folks and the first of

00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:09,190
all thanks for joining me this far and

00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:15,169
so today i'll be presenting on how are

00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:18,100
you today that cluster best practices

00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:20,990
but the same can be applied to or kona

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:28,790
extra little flustered because it also

00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:31,580
includes Valera as asian asian so my

00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:36,890
name is nacho and i work for morality B

00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:39,079
Corporation and my primary job is to

00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:41,380
actually work on my living a cluster

00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:48,020
besides working on some of the bathroom

00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:50,149
and okay so before we begin I just

00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,790
wanted to share this quotation from

00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:58,059
mitch hedberg is an American comedian

00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:01,910
and I felt that this suit squadron the

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:10,220
expectation that one has from a

00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:13,570
distributed system so you know okay so

00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:16,729
just to give it about I just think a

00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:20,930
hostile clinic introduction of really

00:01:16,729 --> 00:01:26,119
big lever Custer so it's a synchronous

00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:27,950
replication system with the all the

00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:32,659
modes can act as a Mossberg they are

00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:34,760
active at at the same time which means

00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:40,869
they think immediately to my right at

00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:43,670
the system al-ghanim and I like the

00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:47,659
classical monstrously replication

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,900
dramatic right lights are expected to be

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:55,030
sent to a mastering and really done

00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:55,030
france-presse relies on this cliff and

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:08,270
it also provides to multiplication

00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:10,910
capability as well as looking in where a

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,850
client directly connect to any of the

00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:16,170
notes

00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:21,420
and lie like a standalone server so that

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:26,310
we wanted a difference and it's really

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:28,740
easy to set up the blast luster so

00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:32,040
here's our selves as I can which kind is

00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,550
typically the idea behind a morir a

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,470
metallic luster so we have in this

00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,690
diagram shown three nodes which are

00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:45,810
learning mice kerala for a DB server and

00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:48,900
they are passed with voice called the

00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:51,750
district patch which is at the bottom of

00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,520
the cylinder and so w strep is basically

00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:58,620
lights if application so it's a it's a

00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:02,640
tragic basically deals with replicating

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:06,180
the changes which happens on or in

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,880
louisville and on leave Italy career

00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:14,100
edition part which is provided by

00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,940
settled lightly by the other so what

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:20,540
happens is you plug in the library to

00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:26,490
the new node to release it emitted

00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:30,450
remain for synchronous replication yeah

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:37,140
once notes are out of it all the treats

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:41,880
and right from the client it is the

00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,640
correct ego really that is V provide a

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:48,450
calendar functioning alongside all week

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,480
vanilla server versions that is 5 5 10 0

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,910
both are here and they usually come a

00:03:51,480 --> 00:04:00,000
couple of weeks after the very less

00:03:53,910 --> 00:04:02,130
errors so the latest one is five five

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,990
four three ten to the land in that era

00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:12,060
and in 10 1 which is right now better we

00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:14,130
just released a 10 15 sometimes I'm so

00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:17,970
what we have done is we have mercy

00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:20,630
changes from the telemetry and the

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,060
server change so it is in one tree now

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,790
so if you download the 10 one packages

00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,660
you

00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:30,670
you didn't even hit power unlike

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,480
versions where the two trees were

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:40,470
different unless I packages percolator

00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:43,780
and longer several and yeah the same one

00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,540
it is this one package once or package

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:48,700
which can a city be used in cluster as

00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:52,420
well as not cluster creations you know

00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:57,090
and then we provide packages for all

00:04:52,420 --> 00:05:03,310
major distributions for example a

00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:05,920
bayesian face and opensuse sounded so

00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,080
i'll quickly dive into how to set up the

00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:10,780
cluster and why do you need two are

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,590
going into all the steps i'll try to

00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:16,600
highlight the important stuff that we

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:20,020
need to keep in mind while setting up

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,910
the cluster running register now so

00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:25,300
these are the important settings which

00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,250
we must assess it in order to get the

00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,910
move into the cluster so the first one

00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,610
is journalistic provider it's basically

00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:36,240
big a little library that needs to be

00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,140
plugged in in order to make that note

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:43,180
capital of bringing synchronous

00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:46,540
replication so the first library link a

00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,610
layer of x sm is is the dog Astro

00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,750
library that basically provides the

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:55,540
scalability replication that ability and

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:59,500
if you do if you just do not rely this

00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:02,830
like set it to not none then the node

00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,770
itself will behave like a little more

00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:10,390
arabic server so it won't have any of

00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:14,560
these so yeah and the second is douglas

00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:18,910
cluster address so this is another

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:23,620
important option or configuration which

00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:26,800
basically tells that where should this

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:30,250
node connected so if already have a

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,620
custard Tara and you want to make a new

00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,080
go join the cluster then all you need to

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,950
do is pass the I did without any of the

00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,690
modes which are already

00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,230
to listen in cluster and it will join

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:47,160
the cluster but let's say if you want to

00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:51,660
start a new cluster then this should be

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:54,870
empty or there's a hard way just take on

00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,630
just the scheme which says that this is

00:06:54,870 --> 00:07:00,270
the very first noble cluster and it is

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,510
not joining me of the classroom so which

00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:07,500
is called bootstrapping basically so you

00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:10,100
would slap against Phil by making SS red

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:13,980
cluster address pointing to an empty

00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:16,020
intercepted and then from there on in

00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:21,110
velocity enjoying by pointing to the IP

00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,730
address of the first law and so on and

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:27,120
replication are the vin log4net has to

00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:32,160
be row so you're aware for a mysql

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:34,620
replication ever three essentially two

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,040
formats left my school supports one is

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,860
robeez of occasion and secondly

00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:45,630
statement based application in a row

00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,620
means application we basically happy

00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:52,050
updates actually building change that

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:54,060
transfer to the other nodes in statement

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,220
based application we just transfer the

00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:00,180
statement on the actual command that was

00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:05,250
executed on the master so the problem

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,610
with a statement later initiative there

00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:13,080
is no information a little bit key and

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:15,990
all the scar so let us pray gallery

00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:17,190
cannot replicate it properly because the

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,240
letter has to do some sort of

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:23,940
certification do you make sure that this

00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,280
particular command of the changes do not

00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:29,370
conflict with the changes on other nodes

00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:35,339
and that's why Ruby's reputation is

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:37,740
mandatory on Ombey cluster setup and

00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:42,240
then comes default storage engine innodb

00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:45,330
because emily is we can't is conduction

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,760
Storen engine which means and which

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:50,350
means you can flag the changes if a

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,910
conflict happens for example

00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:58,000
if new clients are trying to if two

00:08:54,910 --> 00:09:01,390
kinds of setting changes nodes which are

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,360
perfectly then logically one should play

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:06,700
and the other one row lack in filling

00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,010
classification setup and that's why we

00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:13,330
need a storage in transactional

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:16,450
capabilities so currently my reading my

00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:18,640
skin oil in ODP provides that there are

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:26,800
other storages but at the moment a

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:31,540
little support unity another interesting

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:36,850
is a the in honor of loaves has to be

00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:40,690
art art as an to avoid a really

00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:44,500
important problem called split so what

00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,230
happens is in in a cluster environment

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:52,420
let's say a network partition happens

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:56,650
and the entire cluster breaks into two

00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:59,500
parts such that both and actually things

00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:02,590
that they are into majority and then the

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:05,470
they both start accepting changes while

00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:07,150
in this joint and which is which is bad

00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:10,810
actually because now you have two sets

00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:13,840
of data so that's why it is recommended

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:18,220
to have augment of losing a classroom

00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,920
like 35 and so on 20 extra grain and and

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,100
if you're pressed on the hardware

00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,960
sources then there's something called

00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,390
earlier on the trigger which can be used

00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,930
as on other nodes so it's ask a

00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:37,380
stateless no more like a minute but we

00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:42,520
already split brain situation and hello

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:44,260
so once you have that so now it were to

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,740
bootstrap a cluster as I mentioned

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:50,260
earlier what what 1s do is I get a

00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:53,590
couple options if your install my skill

00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:56,770
or any other service you have to just

00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,350
run it with the bootstrap among or there

00:10:56,770 --> 00:11:02,730
is an option called develop new cluster

00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,209
or not determine it is cerebellum

00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,839
cluster

00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:11,019
g'kaan lettuce NP ski video is because

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,679
obviously it's the fashionable so if it

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:16,329
doesn't connect the mode so using any of

00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:19,360
these three commands and goods to a

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:26,740
disaster and later other modes can start

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:30,939
joining it no with a calm energy that is

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:34,389
empty scheme what happens is if you

00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:36,189
leave this thing in my love CNF and it

00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:40,110
says out that i will restart your

00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:46,509
cluster by reading after reading this

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:48,730
option the Norwood started self again so

00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:52,059
it is not recommended to leave this

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,490
option in my OT in the file because if

00:11:52,059 --> 00:12:04,119
you restart it in bootstrap or new

00:11:54,490 --> 00:12:09,040
cluster so yeah now i'm honestly first

00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:11,619
notice up what happens when you make

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,160
other notes trinary cluster it has to do

00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:18,100
something else a transfer as in transfer

00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,100
data from one movie is all about master

00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:29,110
due to the new clothes so which is the

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:32,350
door and your neural thing now so okay

00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:34,839
so there are two methods of translating

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:38,709
the state the phone is natural straight

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:40,600
answer which is closer than easy being

00:12:38,709 --> 00:12:43,360
in handling this all i want to clutter

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,689
and its economic living to select

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,929
transfer which is just answer out of

00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:53,139
portion of the entire state so i'll

00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:57,299
cover both in detail in the coming

00:12:53,139 --> 00:13:00,069
slides so in snapshot street transfer

00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:03,730
basically it's done by a bunch of

00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:06,790
scripts provided in the server package

00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:09,610
so these scripts use different tools

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:15,179
like our sink then corona extra backup

00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:17,510
and rascaldom to transform a seat so I

00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:22,160
think what happens

00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:25,930
exactly I believe I directly of the dual

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,180
mode and copy crew leader in of them so

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:32,360
these are methods which can be used they

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:37,100
all have slight differences and front

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,870
requirement then so these scripts are

00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,670
written based on something called SSD

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:45,770
snapshots data transfer API which means

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:51,110
if these doesn't fit your requirement

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:56,620
you can even invite to do this and the

00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:56,620
last one is there's an option to easily

00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:04,460
mini-epic already architecture let us

00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:06,920
say I'll three moves one of them is

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:09,440
quite busy are you getting make a flick

00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:17,020
wanna be my own anyone's to do the state

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:19,910
transfer yeah basically to do that and

00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:23,180
now moving on to implement is a transfer

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:25,970
so what happens is let's say there was a

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:28,750
cluster with three nodes button on the

00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:36,560
boat was safely gone out for scientists

00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:40,000
Rudy make but it's the city's know by

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,550
the time it it joins again if you have a

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,120
portion of the energy of the entire

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:50,030
state so in that case one can do our

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,970
color absolutely mental state council is

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:56,030
just dismissing like it's a transferable

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:57,680
not the start state and and that's what

00:14:56,030 --> 00:15:00,770
can I community because the answer is

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,970
about so so what happens happens is all

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:07,660
the noggin they in game he changes in

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,340
something called G cache buffer

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,710
sentimental above on all the nodes and

00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:17,570
they are all tracked with a sequence

00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:21,050
number when a node reach life the other

00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,990
donors busy in check if they have the

00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:27,140
difference our business of the Chinese

00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:29,570
edit and then they leadership lea little

00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:32,840
delta to business

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:35,510
not the interstate so this is tank up to

00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:37,970
my mind the whole operation even

00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:44,390
improves the performance of unknown

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:48,140
joint I ganganagar trust us and so we're

00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:51,770
moving on to upgrade will do during the

00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:56,990
night life can definitely feel the skin

00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:59,590
EEMA over the time so in a running trust

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:05,450
love it becomes default mode I'm like a

00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:10,090
baby kitajima because the little boy

00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:13,340
unit answers to style sale ordinary

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:15,890
skill in 11 it is total

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:19,070
registration and then I'll see you are

00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:23,870
rowing ski Margaret so these two have

00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:26,240
their own pluses and minuses total or

00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,530
isolation is the default method so what

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:33,380
happens is master node basically

00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:37,610
directly crossing stage indirectly yes

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:41,050
or schema changes and then it sends this

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:44,870
video to all the ultimate cluster and

00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:48,830
make sure that a big deal execute the

00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:53,320
same slot me all the news that is at any

00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:56,450
time you're nearly total order and

00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:59,600
because it's seemingly statement it uses

00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:02,420
statement based replication format for

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,339
this particular task it just really

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,910
needs the command that was radiated are

00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:10,220
unable to executed on the on the initial

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,550
node on the first node which gets

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:16,970
witches about this particular command

00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:21,860
and rolling schema really is a different

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:25,490
method within the node which it's the

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:28,189
VDL tomorrow basically is be seen from

00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:33,740
the skating a cluster and in there many

00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:36,110
changes slightly longer only now so i'll

00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:39,920
talk about the benefits of this resistor

00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,750
fit so so the no gets decent and then

00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,360
the execution of the medial statement

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,100
happens on

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:48,780
that particular not only and it doesn't

00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:51,750
get replicated and after the edl

00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:55,679
operation has is over the North gets it

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:58,170
back and then changes which has happen

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,790
in the rest of the cluster are allocated

00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:05,280
to this node again now the because of

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,990
this the PDL has happened only on one of

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:10,740
the nose so which means we have to

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:14,970
narrow a cupcake the schema on all the

00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:18,059
animals that last one by one now we r us

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:22,559
point is let's say you have an idea

00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:24,390
which which may take long time so with

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:30,110
the previous option that is total or

00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:32,880
isolation be entire cluster will stop

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:37,710
giving your operational that you are of

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,320
the PDL so for long-running ETA

00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:42,780
operations record it will usually

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,480
operate and if you have a smaller or we

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:54,960
usually videos and leave all should be

00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:56,580
fine and one negative or negative part

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,070
of the rolling scheme are great as a

00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,500
changes should be backward compatible so

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,650
I have shown an example here let's say

00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,299
you have a table and your application

00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:10,440
Institute your application is doing

00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:15,169
inserts on the table and then you have

00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:17,820
you need to add a column to the table so

00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:21,799
enrolling schema and if you run the

00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:25,470
first alter table which is essentially

00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:29,580
inserting a new column between the two

00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:31,500
existing columns then the changes are

00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,390
the answers which happen after that

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,169
we'll start plating and here this

00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,980
cluster on this particular node because

00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:43,880
we this change is not compatible with

00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:47,460
the current inserts which is happening

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,100
so and that's why we have to keep in

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,059
mind that the schema changes has to be

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,059
backward compatible

00:19:54,530 --> 00:20:02,190
right so so what happens is in galera

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:07,170
the replication of right sets happens

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:09,890
over a different port now if you want to

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:13,950
encrypt that particular communication

00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:16,380
narrator provides us some options to

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:19,380
basically encrypt using SSL so these are

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,780
the options which you can use to encrypt

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,340
the calligar communication or the chain

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:27,210
cells which are replicating which are

00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:30,240
being limited by one important thing to

00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:33,450
keep mine is that the bee certificate n

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:40,559
key values has to be same on all the

00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:43,140
nodes so yeah now set that the highest

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:47,309
your incremental state transfer traffic

00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:51,870
is basically encrypted to them because

00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:56,250
of this option but SST the last kind

00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:59,700
it's not really clearly visible but that

00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:02,880
it are charging on here as part of this

00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,020
because that a political class is being

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:11,330
done by different scripts which are

00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:11,330
logically out slightly under control so

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:19,710
but I see a mess of the traffic and

00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:24,780
really losing your options now talking

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:29,370
about SSDs escape one of the method

00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:32,790
which is called SDA extra backup so I

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:35,760
can see some options in traffic visible

00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,700
but at other options like a sink mask

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,340
eltham still doesn't have any option in

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:47,600
which you can enable the encryption of

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:50,790
SSD traffic yeah so now how many

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:55,770
identification is happening there is an

00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:59,460
honor to be able the Acacia my HSE

00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:05,010
kollam by giving a non-optional SS rep

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:10,470
slave touch devices can be realized by

00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:12,750
on this evening thought we knew the

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:17,490
performance but it is a limit on how

00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:21,660
many credit or let's attack in

00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:25,370
Unionville able to give you a program

00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:29,490
seemed an umber which which which

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:34,380
basically you can use is a hundred click

00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:36,270
on your own huh each note in this

00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:42,990
maximum number being or four times

00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:45,990
philippine sea view port horse yeah so

00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:48,660
at the moment only know Elise supported

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:50,640
so the question is why is mathematically

00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:54,350
it is cinema little of action is

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:58,440
non-transactional so in case of conflict

00:22:54,350 --> 00:23:02,580
there is no way to undo the changes and

00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:05,640
that's why niacin is not supported but

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,900
still if you want to replicate changes

00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:12,140
of using my niacin tables there is no

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:15,890
efficient together on it it's experiment

00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:20,880
so yeah so it is this essentially not

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:30,830
recommended to use my some other in

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:34,410
transaction yeah now load balancing so

00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:37,590
when you have multiple notes running a

00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:42,480
classroom so much to you you can

00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:45,710
basically transfer or in a movie times

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,750
to connect to different nodes so that

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,690
just doesn't wanna or one of the loan

00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:53,610
gets bombarded with lots of traffic also

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,760
and then there's no styling elevating

00:23:53,610 --> 00:24:00,740
you can use the different rules like H a

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,510
proxy max k log go later load balancer

00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:07,410
using which you can apply different

00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:10,770
policy on how to route the the new

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:15,710
connections so there are different load

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:17,720
balancing policies for example

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:21,140
redirecting where

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:24,710
you can route all the leads to one of

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:28,040
the nodes right to another so the

00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:31,070
advantage of realized splitting is be

00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:34,310
conflicts another fun-filled cetera gets

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:36,230
in is reduced because all the Rings are

00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:39,500
going to one of the nodes so it's not

00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:46,250
like a masters of alliteration and then

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:50,140
it is not opening yeah you just connect

00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:53,530
the new new connections to another new

00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:57,380
professional least connected so lisa is

00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:59,270
Munich West was duly note with honor of

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:04,630
connections released after is the

00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:09,430
default policy in later organ a little

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:12,640
yeah so there is one more good scheme or

00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:16,880
chocolate operati that you can use to

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:21,770
place for disaster here is a grams diner

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:28,430
tools the idea so there is one cluster 3

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:31,370
nodes and then the final dog she's

00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:33,010
acting in the same mode basically is all

00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:37,430
the traffic which is happening in the

00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:41,390
coloration so we noticed which connected

00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:43,730
using red arrows are basically part of

00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:46,370
the galator cluster and the blue line

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:48,470
hello is the the classical master slave

00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:51,680
application so what we are doing is we

00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:55,390
are transferring we changes which is

00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:58,520
happening in a level that patnik node

00:25:55,390 --> 00:26:01,640
which is really if not so glad that

00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:05,210
accesses a cocoon you can even you use

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:10,400
it to transfer our alligator be a trick

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:13,400
question of that yeah and by the way a

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,030
second mode is the second node please

00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:18,980
say no you didn't have a cluster

00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:23,030
actually so you can cry you can cry

00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:27,170
let's just using a normal one ad be

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:30,050
muscular application to that's possible

00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,140
so all the 3ds scenario

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:37,100
only see more these options which are

00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:40,420
required so so the first one is locked

00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:44,330
in which basically enables the

00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:49,760
materially mask allocation then log

00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:51,620
slave updates sir I easily important

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,960
English if you have to make sure that

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:59,000
the seller ID should be different on all

00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:03,770
the nodes and then GP ID domain ID is

00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:08,200
the it's a new thing that not only

00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:14,720
replication polite and then others are

00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:16,700
doing some related options now one

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,950
important thing is to understand the

00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:25,010
limitations letter S is a as I mention

00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:28,760
that ok the table should have coming all

00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:32,300
the things you have finally key because

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:35,840
that gives used to decide if there is a

00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,880
conflict or not so based on that key

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,640
then I recites if there is a conflict

00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,590
and if there is one then one of the

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,040
transaction gets older and the winner

00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:50,240
one gets applied so that's why you need

00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:52,280
to have a key so always want new option

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,650
which we have introduced in 10 1 which

00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:57,410
is you know really for a quickie so

00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,480
using is the function basically it get

00:27:57,410 --> 00:28:03,530
stolen you cannot create a table without

00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:05,570
a primary key so and then as I said the

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,820
energy storage engine is only supported

00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:13,330
and there is also a limitation on the

00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,330
transaction side nice so why forex on

00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:23,480
troubleshooting um yeah so we briefly

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:26,240
talked about split brain well so so

00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,770
split brain can be basically avoided by

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:33,380
having all number of knows yeah I think

00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:37,010
yeah I did a mistake there so by having

00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:39,610
autograph looks then are using the later

00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,610
alligator

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:47,540
right so another problem that comes in a

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,580
medical helicopter is multimaster

00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:54,500
conflict so I've been talking about the

00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:56,690
conflict so conflict is this even same

00:28:54,500 --> 00:29:00,230
rule is being updated on multiple nodes

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:03,470
at the same time so this happens because

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:05,750
the the design director de la gallera

00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:10,310
users which is obviously confessed and

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:13,070
all very rarely we go with this

00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:16,940
protection that constant will not happen

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:19,100
but if it happen if it happens then one

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:24,560
of the transaction is chosen as victim

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:28,580
and its role that so yeah with a

00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:32,120
deadlock ever so in order to circumvent

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:36,010
that there is an option called Lisa auto

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:42,140
comic which can be set with a number

00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:45,320
automatically try it again if it fails

00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:49,550
and there are some status variables

00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:53,810
which can be used to monitor multimaster

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:55,400
conflict so which is it give you the

00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:58,790
number of conflicts happening on each

00:29:55,400 --> 00:30:07,640
node so based on that you can even find

00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:10,640
out the the heart tables and yeah in

00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:13,550
case of conflict what happens is the

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:18,130
letter dumps Lee the rice set into a

00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:22,760
file with this particular formic gr a

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:26,900
number number and log so this using with

00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:29,420
a union even a defect at what was the

00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:31,820
actual right site which inflicted and

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:36,380
get details out of it as in what was the

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:40,910
table which one will declare it was

00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:43,910
executed in 10 14 we have added another

00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:45,410
version of log file which basically is

00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:48,170
self-sufficient below the previous

00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:50,360
version did not have even log header so

00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:53,810
one has to apply the hitter before

00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,440
looking at before inspecting it and then

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,840
you ain't

00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:02,870
the log file using a tool called nice

00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:06,200
king pin lock now another particle

00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:09,169
shooting is how to detect slow notes so

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:11,389
there are some important status that i

00:31:09,169 --> 00:31:14,450
use which basically using information on

00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:17,389
which node is this tourist or are slow

00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:21,289
in the cluster so because it's a

00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:24,919
synchronous replication be slower known

00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:27,440
and Cosby replication anytime plus you

00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:31,250
can slope because it has to keep up with

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:35,419
the changes so in order to detect that

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:39,830
in fact you can check the WF flow

00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:42,080
control center is available and a local

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:46,129
received q variables who is to gives an

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:48,379
idea on on the bigger the number which

00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:50,600
means the slower the notice it is not

00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:56,240
able to keep up the d with the actual

00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:59,750
traffic yeah and the upper limit and

00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:02,389
lower limit basically gives an idea on

00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:04,759
when does the flow control kick in

00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:15,080
lenguin when does it get released on a

00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:18,350
particular load yeah so so just one

00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:22,460
stack it was usual in denial see you

00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:26,509
asking or this question so so the

00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:32,779
question was he had unknown and a

00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:35,870
cluster a standalone server now the

00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:39,169
server was 18 you are age but crystal

00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:43,940
says I mean he was a backup kind of

00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:47,529
thing but the note the new had Eureka as

00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:50,899
in it was active so what he did is he

00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:54,019
got this note and a pass as a joiner to

00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:57,559
rest of the cluster thinking that legal

00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:59,570
bring it off me updates but what

00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:03,590
actually happened is it happened the

00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:06,139
other way and the load itself and found

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,800
created as in all the new chains were

00:33:06,139 --> 00:33:11,240
lost

00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:16,250
so yeah so that's a bad thing the idea

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,140
is Joyner will only see ugly the mode

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:19,580
which is joining the cluster we will

00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,700
receive the changes and not the other

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,820
way and we are showing his new mode

00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:30,550
basically lost some of the contents

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:30,550
religious when inclined to the foster

00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:38,810
another pinnacle is your application

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:43,340
should be a better or should be aware of

00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:48,320
the fact that the Illuminati situation

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:53,180
and the reason being in calera in order

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:56,960
to avoid conflicts we all the words have

00:33:53,180 --> 00:34:02,480
different auto increment values actually

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:04,010
so that they won't conflict and that's

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,470
really because of the different auto

00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:13,510
increment settings the resulting auto

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:13,510
increment values are not sequential

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:20,870
another good for is going to be a show

00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:23,150
that be all these things are close to

00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:26,270
each other for all the nodes for example

00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:29,000
the SSD method or SSL settings which we

00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:32,419
discussed before should be safe on all

00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,660
the nodes now talking about access

00:34:32,419 --> 00:34:39,410
denied it and I managing SSD basic unit

00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:41,929
of spirit so each has Tim rolls

00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:44,840
they need to play one is the diner roll

00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,730
and don't do a roll now if we have two

00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:50,540
different scripts running on different

00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:53,480
nodes they won't be able to communicate

00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:56,419
properly that is why one has to have

00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:00,560
same SSD minutes and others taking

00:34:56,419 --> 00:35:03,860
across the cluster on all the node yeah

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,880
so that kind of concludes all I have to

00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:09,770
say about Olivia I am so my we

00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,060
have a source code available on github

00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:17,000
and the documentation is there besides

00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:20,150
even with port works you can this with

00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,359
new ideas or issues on the main list you

00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:22,839
can

00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:28,910
even chat with us on validity on

00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:43,339
national on free mode that's it yeah so

00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:46,880
questions my squirrel passages are some

00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:53,809
tables and your whole time so how does

00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:58,549
that trance if they're very very sick so

00:35:53,809 --> 00:36:03,739
if I'm are running online I'm table okay

00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:09,200
and Ryan total water fellation my server

00:36:03,739 --> 00:36:14,239
provide my class revealed ism 45 yeah I

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:17,029
think anymore Frank because one thing is

00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,009
they're gonna make sure that the altar

00:36:17,029 --> 00:36:21,799
table itself happens at the same slot as

00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:25,369
it that is on all the notes it will

00:36:21,799 --> 00:36:28,880
happen at the same time and buy online

00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:30,710
it also means that if they Riley all the

00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:38,509
label is in progress will keep accepting

00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:41,630
the changes ah so the nation me 5 i'll

00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:47,690
make sure everything by this one it

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:50,720
sounds like I'm table and until that is

00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:55,249
done else executed and then they started

00:36:50,720 --> 00:37:04,640
forever hello earth now so if that's the

00:36:55,249 --> 00:37:06,739
case sent one line yeah yeah oh yeah I

00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:12,829
don't have to take what you're saying is

00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:18,650
this was on TV happens in total order

00:37:12,829 --> 00:37:23,239
yeah so Jesus don't eat changes okay but

00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:26,250
uh I think uh he already pissed

00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:31,200
algorithms dunno

00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:39,390
online of the other day between okay

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:43,410
okay so well right so during that

00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:46,470
operation the notes will not accept

00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:52,140
incarnations of new changes through that

00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:58,410
hip okay okay is it good evening for you

00:37:52,140 --> 00:38:06,680
have a long line of questioning one life

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:06,680
bible yeah okay

00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:24,369
so let me ask another vivid my wifey use

00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:28,630
a diet apps for SSD and not the body

00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:35,279
loss it seems to have a the same the

00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:38,680
same day ok so I think because of these

00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:45,940
Arjun socal if I maintains its own order

00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:48,130
and and I think the letter cash itself

00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:53,170
is maintained by they deliver library

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:56,789
and not by the server so i think it's

00:38:53,170 --> 00:39:02,079
mostly honoring i mean if you at the

00:38:56,789 --> 00:39:04,089
replication state machine the revolution

00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,589
stating machine it tells that all the

00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:11,950
dots should have a lot and that largely

00:39:07,589 --> 00:39:15,039
the same so that's what I think dynamic

00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:19,619
games its own cash for this particular

00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:39,869
purpose but how why Cannot do you maybe

00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:44,019
usually binding on a notch not just done

00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:55,000
no but in using circular cash it's not

00:39:44,019 --> 00:40:01,319
the entire binding energy me pin lock

00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,319
and clarity yeah

00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:19,270
okay now so how is that it acknowledges

00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:21,609
defend from ah my school I don't really

00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:25,030
go off a horrible degree from position

00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:30,490
number one is it'll be first we walk

00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:33,940
back with perfect oh so sometimes on the

00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:37,510
stage so both are really the same

00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:40,540
research paper but my skin the group

00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:43,630
replication uses quadrazine and Aragon

00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:46,090
has an implementation group

00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:48,700
communications yeah Davis makes for me

00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:56,560
you're going to get away for oh is it

00:40:48,700 --> 00:41:00,300
okay okay and then a few of my success

00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:15,550
for chronic survival for patients every

00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:17,170
turn them over why yeah it probably just

00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:21,339
again or lesbian a provision on the

00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:23,770
battery yes he's like a microwave say

00:41:21,339 --> 00:41:25,660
hey you just have to make sure it have a

00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:30,820
class to write it all down to do the

00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:57,220
same event you must buy talk with us try

00:41:30,820 --> 00:42:01,119
this for me so you're saying Everett

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:05,260
lots of it even number no I'm thinking

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:07,000
about they typically have notes leave it

00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,890
or join cluster on the walk right for

00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,589
example have seven notes he wanted to

00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,869
die now I have six coups done of people

00:42:11,589 --> 00:42:15,400
I cannot get around the safe classical

00:42:13,869 --> 00:42:19,420
era because there's always going to be

00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,270
certain times the number of policy yes

00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:25,599
I'm who bravely stone to eat them that

00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:27,160
problem with it as I mean the eb or the

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,680
Christian managing that Russell has to

00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,170
make sure that he has to either either a

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,740
delay arbitrator because when the node

00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:41,170
number comes down to an even there is a

00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:44,200
possibility that a needle passion that

00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:47,320
happen happened in that case its diverse

00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:50,410
is very well over the park the thing

00:42:47,320 --> 00:43:10,320
that they are into they have the corner

00:42:50,410 --> 00:43:10,320
and they'll basically except yeah

00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:27,940
so be cool I have to look at the formula

00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:30,090
so I mean a flea bass it is not about

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:33,340
the note wasn't like i would say have a

00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:37,200
full note right into data center believe

00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:40,690
in those data centers what up right and

00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:42,910
they typically in this case if you have

00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:46,690
both data centers in saying oh not

00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:49,510
work i supported and in this case it

00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:51,370
does make sense to have it harder to

00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,160
write with your say resorted to data

00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:56,920
center with one yeah next Olympics keep

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,230
talking if it goes into data centers

00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,070
then one of them which has if there are

00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:05,140
too smart right but it also there's

00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:08,680
always a sword for example you know i

00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:12,490
have three days to note invent one two

00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,620
datacenters ghosts are then what who

00:44:12,490 --> 00:44:20,170
cares how you can engage in 20 and

00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:25,480
formulate a little bit okay yeah need to

00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:28,690
eat reason right soap writing Oh put the

00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:31,440
puzzles in the face work the splitter

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:34,210
but no patches it's now you've never

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:39,090
know still operates there's something

00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:41,890
really should be the cluster I'm sorry

00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,780
integrated safety but you still have the

00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,760
majority of films online i'm able to

00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:52,930
usually communicate the cluster will

00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:56,020
operate because yeah I think I also even

00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:58,150
number of those is it the probable I

00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:02,980
mean unless you illiterate the case you

00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:06,250
subscribe although it is even please

00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,900
yeah right with either number the

00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,780
chances you'll have a cluster out of

00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,880
your greater because the chances of the

00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:15,069
right never going down okay but I need

00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,339
get all night

00:45:15,069 --> 00:45:21,130
saying oh babe let's say five el trago

00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:26,559
he chapter 2 hour ago two three of them

00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:29,829
going to cool down yeah my point is he's

00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:32,410
had a lot of good sake I would say no

00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:34,599
he's an air from jobs right right now

00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,339
will be forever six know then that sees

00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,729
them good you know they're 60 is

00:45:36,339 --> 00:45:42,130
actually better than honey pot covers

00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:44,650
one into the final stage anything is

00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:46,959
heated say you have not a question about

00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:49,630
it have a little more but a question

00:45:46,959 --> 00:45:53,979
about is it growing busting the past huh

00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:56,469
I mean jump another 30 really unique 44

00:45:53,979 --> 00:45:58,209
because for red meat is one of the dice

00:45:56,469 --> 00:46:01,660
and you still have a result which is

00:45:58,209 --> 00:46:03,489
even plot and I want and I before 42

00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:08,890
notes you can work with and come eat

00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:11,619
yeah and then you have a body clock

00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:13,690
seven eight and hope that isn't more to

00:46:11,619 --> 00:46:27,039
ski in Greece because you're a lot more

00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:30,779
right here uhm yeah okay busy that's is

00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:30,779
it thank you

00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:40,050
oh okay website or application it makes

00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:51,960
lower non-responsive it infuriates your

00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:53,520
users and costs you money Nori's that

00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,010
can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,170
resource limitations and other problems

00:47:56,010 --> 00:48:00,090
how do you keep an eye on all of your

00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:04,850
systems performance metrics can you

00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:08,990
online this data for reliever enough

00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:12,210
what's really going on under the hood is

00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:13,770
the status of all your systems providing

00:48:12,210 --> 00:48:17,490
you with a bird's-eye view of your

00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:20,370
entire feet you can sort by cpu Wow

00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:22,710
processes load and network usage click a

00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:25,230
specific system to access its individual

00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:27,260
dash or then click and drag to sit on

00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:30,000
chokepoints and get more detailed

00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:34,080
comprehensive network data including

00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,000
inbound and outbound traffic and disk

00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,760
rights and free space on the disk tab

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,550
while the glass displays usage

00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,040
statistics for individual processes the

00:48:41,550 --> 00:48:46,050
system info tab shows listening services

00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:48,510
active connections and available updates

00:48:46,050 --> 00:48:50,820
adding long view to a system is easy

00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:52,680
just click the button copy the one line

00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,660
installation command then run the

00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:56,610
command on your linux system to complete

00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:58,290
the process the agent will begin

00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:01,220
collecting data and sending it to

00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:04,080
longview then the graph start rolling

00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:06,180
use long view to aim visibility into

00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:10,160
your servers he'll win your website or

00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:10,160
app heats up it stays up

00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,980
Oh

00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,260
Oh

00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:07,140
citrix xenserver gives you everything

00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:10,140
you need to integrate manage and

00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:12,270
automate a virtual data center all on an

00:51:10,140 --> 00:51:14,640
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:17,400
platform and at a third of the cost of

00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,110
other solutions but why even bother with

00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,270
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:23,220
in the first place well let's say you

00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:25,530
have a traditional one server to one

00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:27,570
application architecture but you're

00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:30,180
running out of resources and performance

00:51:27,570 --> 00:51:32,450
is suffering once you order new server

00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:35,310
hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:38,160
configure it in some business

00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:42,180
application stage and test the server

00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,530
and add it to your production farm if

00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:45,360
you've been through this process before

00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:48,240
you know it can take weeks or even

00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:50,130
months you also know it's a manually

00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,170
intensive process that will burden your

00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,890
team every time you outgrow your current

00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:57,630
setup with a virtual server solution you

00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:00,420
could accomplish all of that in less

00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:02,310
than half at a river virtualization

00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:05,130
software separates the OS and

00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:07,350
application relying server hardware and

00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,910
with multiple virtual machines on a

00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:09,799
single

00:52:07,910 --> 00:52:12,770
server you can use each of them to run

00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:14,869
different os's and applications this

00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,299
makes it to move your virtual machine

00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:19,359
from one piece apart another whenever

00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:22,010
you want to maximize utilization

00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:24,170
simplify maintenance or recover from a

00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:27,170
hardware failure and without slowing

00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:29,510
down your applications or users clearly

00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:32,329
server virtualization provides big

00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:35,030
benefits and Citrix XenServer provides

00:52:32,329 --> 00:52:37,220
even more since it's built on an open

00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:39,619
platform then server plays well with

00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:42,289
your existing hardware storage systems

00:52:39,619 --> 00:52:43,609
and IT management software as well as

00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:46,520
with the industry's leading cloud

00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:48,170
service providers best of all you can
