alright so Zach Underwood with global

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:10,500
vision little intro about global vision

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:12,139
before I why we're not an evil is P and

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,509
a little bit about net neutrality so

00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,250
global vision is a small isp we're a

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:19,529
actually a wireless isp is our main

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,689
business so we proved our last mile is

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,330
Wireless for the most part fixed

00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:26,279
wireless we are a small isp in

00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,179
Greenville South Carolina which is the

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:35,300
Upstate we have a mixture of business

00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:38,760
and residential mostly business and we

00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,219
one of the reasons why we are not a ISP

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,370
is first off we can't be we don't have

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,219
market control in a geographical area we

00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,520
do not have a significant percent of the

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:52,800
end users so we cannot say this is our

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,660
way or the highway because the highway

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,820
for most of our customers is charter or

00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,379
AT&T so they could get up and leave if

00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:21,920
we piss them off so what is net

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:21,920
neutrality oh how do you

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,950
alright so you get the fee okay so I can

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:36,840
move okay so what is net neutrality

00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,610
unfortunately there's a lot of food fear

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,869
uncertainty doubt about net neutrality

00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:46,350
title to regulations and change I'm not

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,569
trying to add to the foot I am this is a

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,719
presentation from a nice piece point of

00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:54,299
view so it is it is a biased

00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,920
conversation bias in my favor I'm the

00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,330
presenter welcome to my welcome to my

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,670
power so um net neutrality some say that

00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:05,069
data should all be treated equal I say

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,940
not really there are different classes

00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:12,420
of data from a technical point of view

00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,310
for example VoIP traffic and gaming

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,290
traffic gaming traffic is not a high

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:21,650
volume but it is extremely latency

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:25,110
sensitive so does that does voice and um

00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:27,030
VoIP and gaming traffic deserve to be on

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,000
the same tier as someone's bittorrent

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,100
download I say no some people say yes

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,739
from a technical point of view it's

00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:38,209
pretty clear where you get into some

00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:42,239
murkiness is from on the technical side

00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:47,359
you know does you know does DNS should

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,470
DNS be a higher priority than netflix

00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:51,389
DNS is actually one of the number one

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,639
things that you can do to speed up your

00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:56,100
internet connection is get a good DNS

00:02:53,639 --> 00:02:59,459
provider because a lot of people will

00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:01,829
attribute their sluggish internet

00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,440
connection to actually being on slow DNS

00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:07,109
servers and and waiting that time for

00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,030
the response to come back typically the

00:03:07,109 --> 00:03:12,290
slowest DNS servers are actually

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,489
provided by the ISPs we we don't provide

00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:17,370
dns service to our customers we just

00:03:14,489 --> 00:03:19,380
point them at google's which for the

00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:24,630
most part are the fastest dns servers

00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:30,500
that i've known yes yes the guy from

00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:34,349
google or is the bulk cloud backup that

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,390
just trickles up all day long does that

00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,960
need to be on the same tier as your

00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:44,180
email smtp pop I'm at

00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:48,820
said I say no um what today's net

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:51,110
neutrality fight is really about is one

00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:53,690
one big company against another big

00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:58,760
company an example the biggest example

00:03:53,690 --> 00:04:01,400
is Netflix vs Comcast and what it is

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,820
what i believe the net neutrality debate

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,650
today is really about is one set of

00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:09,290
companies wanting another set of

00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:14,150
companies to not change their business

00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,489
model particularly meter data scares the

00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:19,550
crap out of Netflix because if you now

00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:22,220
have a data cap or have to pay like like

00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:24,590
like a real utility pay for actual usage

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,660
like like you do with power you pay by

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:31,730
the kilowatt or with water you pay by

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:33,950
the gallon if if if all ISPs in the US

00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:35,960
was to go to that model we paid per

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,910
gigabyte you know it could be it could

00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,420
only be five cents or a penny with it

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,820
whatever the number is per gigabyte

00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,180
Netflix's business would tank so they

00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:50,510
are wanting the this is what i believe

00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,670
is netflix in the other content company

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:57,200
so this would be youtube back to google

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:58,940
and hulu and all the other content

00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,110
providers including the news agencies

00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:06,500
won't the business models of ISPs not to

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,330
change and if you have questions just

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,610
raise them up I don't mind being

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:17,720
interrupted so what's really happened in

00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:21,820
the past people will say that there's

00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,810
been a lot of examples of ice peas

00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,450
violating net new so-called net

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:29,150
neutrality in the past there's only been

00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:31,280
one known existence of that happening

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,750
here in the US and that was with Madison

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,820
River communications they're actually

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:43,580
based here in North Carolina they were

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:46,510
based here in North Carolina yes no it

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:49,669
is not there was a technical reason why

00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:51,169
why there was a degradation and service

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:52,550
it was not throttling it was a

00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:54,170
degradation and service

00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,810
there was a technical reason behind that

00:05:54,170 --> 00:06:05,660
and I'll get to that in peering and and

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:08,150
a little bit later well got let me

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,180
address that in the period yes the

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:13,700
question is what happened between campus

00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,000
and Netflix one gentleman assert said

00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,340
that is a violation of net neutrality I

00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,350
say it is a technical problem and i will

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:25,280
i'll adjust that and a little later when

00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:28,210
i get to peering so in 2004 madis river

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,750
community case outright blocked skype

00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:34,400
and during this during this blockage

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:37,310
they were blocking i believe it was dns

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:40,730
and the IP addresses that skype was

00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:42,860
using at the time that only lasted a few

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:45,380
months because there was such an outcry

00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,950
from their own users that they said fine

00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:51,800
we're giving up and that this was on

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,020
their dsl connections because Madison

00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,720
River communications was the phone

00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,190
company and that area so they like oh

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,150
it's going to cut into our business

00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:04,040
skype is a big big evil thing and so

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:05,690
they had that they decided to block it

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,060
but after a few months they had to stop

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:14,740
there have there are some other examples

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:18,800
of ISPs blocking outright blocking

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:20,120
differences but that outside of the US

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:27,140
but that is out of the scope of this

00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:30,970
discussion so does anyone believe that

00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,990
throttling from an ISP throttling

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:37,220
particularly a residential connection

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:48,380
can be a good thing does anyone think it

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:52,400
is a good thing I okay so so the

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,260
question was I depends on how the how

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,130
it's done and how its implemented yes I

00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,130
would agree to that aspect

00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,730
typically with businesses uh I'm sorry

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,200
I'm sorry the other questions the

00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:12,370
question was why did I specify

00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,570
residential / business residential

00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:18,350
typically or a bunch of cheap asses and

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:21,290
they can't value the value of connection

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:24,290
a good quality and pay for a good

00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:27,980
quality connection businesses on the

00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:30,860
other hand can typically when we hold on

00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:35,330
typically when we sell internet access

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:38,720
to a business customer we sell it in the

00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:42,440
price per megabit or megabyte so if we

00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:44,720
say say we charge $15 a megabit and you

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,280
buy a hundred Knight connection that

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,750
that connection is going to cost that's

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,270
a hundred men symmetric that's going to

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:52,940
cost you fifteen hundred dollars a month

00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,560
so at that price I don't care what you

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,650
do with your connection because there's

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,240
enough money for us to build the

00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,440
infrastructure so that you can use that

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,290
connection one hundred percent of the

00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,590
time I don't care all right quick

00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,590
question

00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:30,860
okay so the question the question was

00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:34,070
that she believes that people are paying

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,720
too much for internet connect internet

00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:39,260
connections for equipment that's already

00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,660
existing and that if we throttle service

00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:44,870
or we thought all that we all must also

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:48,620
thought oh payment so let me address let

00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:53,209
me address the existing equipment that

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:57,080
is not true equipment ages out it gets

00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:59,120
replaced with newer technology so now

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,430
once you go to the newer technology the

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,760
price per gigabyte or you know price

00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:07,070
price per speed metric gets better so if

00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,790
you go from a one gate connection to a

00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:13,700
10 gig connection you know it's not 10

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,830
times the cost for the equipment side

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,980
but you can now deliver 10 times the

00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:22,459
speed so it's not necessarily correct

00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:27,140
about the existing equipment so when

00:10:22,459 --> 00:10:31,399
throttle is a good thing is microsoft

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:34,970
updates with not deep packet inspection

00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:37,339
but purely looking at the IP addresses

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,740
of the traffic which cannot be masked

00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:42,829
you cannot mask the IP addresses of TCP

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:45,640
traffic by purely looking at the IP

00:10:42,829 --> 00:10:48,350
addresses we can tell which services

00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:51,550
that particular client is using whether

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:54,880
it's Netflix Hulu microsoft updates

00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:57,620
apple updates and all these other

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,010
metrics so throttling could actually be

00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,440
a good thing let's say you have a 10

00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:05,570
minute in Meg connection and you have

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,709
two people in the house watching Netflix

00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:12,170
and then there's a iphone that does an

00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:14,779
iOS update those have been getting

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:16,579
really big lately pushing three gigs on

00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:22,459
depending on exactly which model you

00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:24,170
have and so that that iphone will start

00:11:22,459 --> 00:11:25,790
that download well the connection is

00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,589
already being saturated by the two

00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:30,949
people watching Netflix because the

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:32,540
minimum speed for HD netflix is five

00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:34,550
megs so if you get to people that's

00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,960
I trading the 10 meg connection now you

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:40,520
have this now you have this phone that

00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,770
does is iOS update that can cause the

00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,560
two netflix streams to start buffering

00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:50,150
Oh bit buffering I'll get to that in a

00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:53,930
minute and so now there is a there is a

00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:56,180
poor user experience because the users

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,280
may be intentionally updated or

00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:04,240
unintentionally started that download

00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:06,590
however if as the ISP we throttle down

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:13,570
specific things that are low priority

00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:16,580
like microsoft updates like backups like

00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:19,520
Apple OS updates that we can actually

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:28,910
make the experience better for the end

00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:33,620
users yes yes this is absolutely the

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:37,430
opposite of what the net neutrality

00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:39,590
regulation is trying to prevent you know

00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,050
flaw dling can be used for good things

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:50,360
it's not a dirty word like some people

00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:53,630
have implied at the ISP level because

00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:55,100
you are one and one and a of time the

00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,130
gentleman says he doesn't said his own

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:00,680
house and he's asking where I think I

00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,360
where where I think it should be done I

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,330
think it should be done at the ISP level

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,610
because you the fact that you even

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,680
manage your own router is one in a

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,110
million the vast majority of the end

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,480
users don't even manage the router so

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:23,870
they're not going to implement any form

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:25,940
of qos um the typical Soho router is so

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:34,160
cheap it could not do this level of of

00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:37,000
of analyzation of the traffic yes I

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,000
again

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,540
yes again you're not the average user

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:48,439
that's ideal I deal with the average

00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,589
user users who if their internal

00:13:48,439 --> 00:13:55,939
wireless stops they immediately blame

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:59,470
the ISP it no all only if they ask and

00:13:55,939 --> 00:14:02,420
the vast majority of them don't ask and

00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:04,699
so we don't manage the equipment and so

00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:07,730
sometimes we have to tell them you know

00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:10,069
are the DMark the demarcation mark is

00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:12,170
here everything after that is your is

00:14:10,069 --> 00:14:28,730
your problem and so sometimes we have to

00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:30,679
have love okay so the question was um we

00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,309
do by in a the question was we buy

00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:37,850
internet from someone else that is true

00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:40,420
how would we feel if our upstream ISP

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,309
did that I come back to the price point

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,170
we a lot of money for internet

00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:46,370
connections it's for the two internet

00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,970
connections in silver four thousand

00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:53,050
dollars a month so at that price we

00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:55,850
expect a different set of parameters

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,860
then the person that is paying thirty

00:14:55,850 --> 00:15:03,439
dollars a month for their residential

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:05,120
service so that kind of sums up when I

00:15:03,439 --> 00:15:06,889
think throttling is a good thing and it

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,670
actually can make for a better

00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:14,480
experience to the end-user if certain

00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:16,160
things are throttled and and also if

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,790
certain things are promoted like if we

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:24,110
promote DNS up to one of the highest

00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:27,889
levels of importance we can now ensure

00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:30,439
that the end user has a good a good

00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:34,189
experience and a little bit about

00:15:30,439 --> 00:15:36,589
Netflix and how it does caching Netflix

00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:39,309
actually does not cash hardly any it

00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:41,569
maybe there's a few seconds at most

00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:45,319
that's mostly because the device is that

00:15:41,569 --> 00:15:48,470
it runs on our incredibly cheap and

00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:51,049
incredibly stupid as far as their

00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,390
sophistication is concerned so they

00:15:51,049 --> 00:15:54,300
don't

00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:58,920
either have the ram or the disk or the

00:15:54,300 --> 00:16:02,270
flash to do much caching so by the price

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,280
point of these Indian devices going down

00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,620
it now puts more pressure on the ISP to

00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:10,590
have a absolute perfect connection

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,350
because if for whatever reason there's a

00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:16,650
small I mean it could just be a one or

00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,100
two second dip that will be felt almost

00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:24,000
immediately in netflix and also the way

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,700
netflix does this is per device so some

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,410
devices are better than others when

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,770
netflix is running particularly on some

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:37,200
low-end devices is it see it basically

00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:41,550
does a saw blade effect with tcp tcp has

00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:44,280
a slow ramp-up so TCP actually throw

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:47,430
limits how much speed you can get and it

00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,930
basically creeps up keeps sending a

00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,450
little bit faster and faster and faster

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:54,660
until it starts getting drops and then

00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:57,750
it backs down a little bit and then it

00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:01,430
will do this slight seesaw pattern the

00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:04,589
way Netflix does is they're very bursty

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:06,720
so if you have a 10 meg connection even

00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:09,390
though 5 is the minimum it will

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,790
constantly spike up to that 10 meg and

00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:18,270
then fall back down and then spike up

00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:24,329
again I'm probably for delivery deliver

00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:27,329
reliability the it also depends on what

00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:29,460
provider they're using because not all

00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:31,140
the netflix true not all the netflix

00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,960
traffic comes from netflix servers

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:35,520
themselves they use level 3 for caching

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,760
they use Akamai for caching they can

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,970
even use the ISP for caching like I know

00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,490
particularly in shorter netflix has an

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:46,080
entire rack and in one of chartres data

00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,390
centers that if you down if you aren't

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,770
charters network and you download from

00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:54,180
netflix it's actually not leaving

00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:56,430
charters network and but i'll talk a

00:17:54,180 --> 00:18:00,750
little bit more about that and then when

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:04,320
i get the peering um the usf fund oh

00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:04,930
that's my joy the US funds for the

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,680
universal

00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:15,730
service fund it was a program originally

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:19,390
you developed to subsidize a landline

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:24,730
phone service this is like think 30s 40s

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:29,440
50s to extremely rural areas as of the

00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:31,510
second quarter of 2015 the rate was

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,180
seventeen point four percent so if

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:37,480
you're if you get phone service either

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:40,150
cellphone or landline there is a 17

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:45,310
point four percent tax that is put on

00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:48,820
that bill by the FCC to then divvy it

00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:53,320
out to two particularly phone companies

00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:56,020
to provide service that this is this

00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,870
relates to title 2 then there's a

00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,790
lifeline program and the 80s the

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:06,520
Lifeline program was started by Ronald

00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:14,620
Reagan it was to give landlines to poor

00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:17,350
people as a way to call 911 and turn he

00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,480
extended it to mobile phones so this is

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,080
what some people dubbed the Obama phone

00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:27,040
what it is is it is a think a ten dollar

00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:29,050
a month subsidy and so you have a lot of

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,760
the and it comes with two hundred fifty

00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:36,760
minutes and I think some SMS and no data

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,980
and again it is MIT as more of an

00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:41,970
emergency service to communicate

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:44,050
particularly with 911 and so sometimes

00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:46,270
pickle particularly in lower income

00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,150
areas you'll see a little pop-up tents

00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:55,090
with them selling phone service it

00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:59,040
relates the Lifeline program and then

00:19:55,090 --> 00:20:02,020
there's erate erate is a program that

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:05,680
takes some of the money from usf and

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:07,450
gives it to libraries and school

00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:11,710
districts to try to get better

00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:13,690
connectivity to the students there is

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:17,800
been a history of abuse in the e-rate

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,580
program due to the bidding process it is

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,159
very dif

00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,370
golt to get in to become an authorized

00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:26,860
vendor and the e-rate program so a lot

00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:28,659
of vendors don't even bother with it

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,570
because it's not worth the hassle what

00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:34,059
that does is it drives for the vendors

00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:36,730
that get into the e-rate program they

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:40,470
now charge a premium for the product and

00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:44,110
AT&T has been accused in the past of

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,460
selling a connection to a non-school for

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,640
let's say a thousand dollars a month

00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:50,140
under erate they'll sell the same exact

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,360
product for three thousand dollars a

00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:56,200
month so three times it cost because it

00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:59,950
went through the e-rate program then

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,720
there are providers uh yeah that's like

00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,830
I said there's sometimes providers will

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:12,880
charge excessive amount of money just

00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:17,950
for the same exact product title to this

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:21,100
was passed by the FCC I think it was the

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:23,860
chairman plus five commissioners voted

00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:27,309
on it two commissioners voted against it

00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:30,610
the rest fell lock stop in step with the

00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:34,779
chairman and it was split down party

00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:39,610
lines Democrat Republican as such there

00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:41,500
are like with most over big bills and

00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,429
laws there are some good things

00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:48,730
particularly the pole attachment because

00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:51,700
now is PS or considered utilities we

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:55,750
have the same privilege that AT&T the

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:58,299
phone come or 80 charter Duke power or

00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,539
any other utilities have at getting

00:21:58,299 --> 00:22:04,690
access to the polls so basically getting

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:08,649
the right to mount on every pole or get

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:12,789
access to right away right away is

00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:15,570
basically publicly accessible land that

00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:18,840
is privately owned so if you own a lot

00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:21,610
that bucks up against a public street

00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:26,350
depending on what state you're in that

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:29,260
lasts between two and six feet you

00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:30,500
actually do not control this the public

00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:35,060
the public

00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:37,100
utilities can control and they can they

00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:39,890
can dig up your driveway and you can't

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,500
say no to it because n when you bought

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:45,230
the property their so called easements

00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,230
in public right of ways it is up to the

00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:50,750
property owner to know where the public

00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:54,110
right of ways go and if you build on

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:56,330
that public right-of-way the utility

00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,610
that wants access to that section has

00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:03,470
the right to tell you that you need to

00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:04,880
get rid of that obstacle this Clemson

00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:08,240
University actually ran into this a

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,800
little hiccup there was a there's a rail

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,520
line that runs through Clemson

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:16,450
University owned by I think it's no folk

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,420
southern and they built a building

00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:22,760
within so many feet of that rail line

00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:25,730
and now know folks southern wants to put

00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:30,220
a second rail line a alongside their

00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:33,250
existing one and so now clemson has

00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,470
basically has to demo that building

00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:38,510
because they built with the knowledge

00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,210
that they were within the right-of-way

00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:44,450
of no southern and so as a utility

00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:47,920
we now have that same privilege so we

00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:52,390
can trench and we don't have to seek the

00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,390
permission of the homeowner yes

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:10,770
no it's um the question was is if let's

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,539
say the the right-of-way is 3 feet and

00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,510
are you totally built does it get

00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:18,270
extended no it is actually app it is

00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:22,110
relative to the road that it runs along

00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:24,179
so if the edge of the road is here then

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,860
and some in the jurisdiction you don't

00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:29,940
you have like three feet this way

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,650
however if in the future they expand the

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,640
road let's say they add another lane to

00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,750
it now that right of way does move

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,210
relative to the edge of the road and

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,919
some jurisdictions its relative to the

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:43,620
edge of the road some jurisdictions is

00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:51,270
its relative to the center line of the

00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:54,630
road so bad things went up again um so

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:57,240
first is it now adds a tremendous

00:24:54,630 --> 00:25:01,100
regulatory overhead to an industry that

00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,390
has been pretty well regulation free

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,190
we've really haven't had many

00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:07,860
regulations on the internet industry and

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:11,159
that's why I think it has thrived the

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,870
way it has if you look at how far you

00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:18,120
know the industry has come in the past

00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:21,030
18 25 years where you went from only

00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:24,840
universities connected with phone lines

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:26,520
essentially to now where we have the I

00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,140
mean everyone in here probably has a

00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:34,470
device connected to the internet right

00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:36,870
now so it increases legal fees normally

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,630
when we normally when we do a contract

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,030
or terms and conditions and some and

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,880
that's such we could go to a normal

00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:47,580
business lawyer who would probably

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:51,030
charge between a hundred and two hundred

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:54,780
dollars an hour to review those

00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:58,860
documents or even write them now we have

00:25:54,780 --> 00:26:02,640
to send um we have to send and get the

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,690
help of a telecom lawyer they they think

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,580
they think their service is very

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,380
precious and very nice they charge

00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,309
anywhere from four to six hundred

00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:14,100
dollars an hour and to review just a

00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:15,090
single contract they they may have to

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:17,880
look up

00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:21,060
slaw or case examples so to even review

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,070
a single you know 10 page terms and

00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,570
conditions you know it you could be

00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:29,030
looking at a couple of days worth of

00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:32,060
time and it's very expensive to do that

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:35,760
the next is the reporting requirements

00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:38,550
on the FCC thinks it's a great thing for

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,790
us to report statistics I wouldn't

00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,940
disagree however they're one of the

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,520
things they're vague and their specific

00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,500
at the same time one of the things one

00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,410
of the reporting requirements is ping

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,590
times Layton sees and drop packets but

00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:59,070
they don't specify to where so is it

00:26:55,590 --> 00:27:02,430
from the is it from the end is it first

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:05,850
off is it a specific endpoint or is it

00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:08,730
an average of endpoints is it to one of

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,670
our internal servers is it to a server

00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:16,170
outside of the company is it a server

00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:17,820
that's here in the US is it sir so how

00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,820
do you implement so how do you implement

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,590
a requirement to report latency when

00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:26,790
they don't tell you what you're trying

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:29,100
to test you know hey I could produce

00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:31,020
some really nice graphs of pinging one

00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,820
of our best customers to one of our best

00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,460
servers and get less than a millisecond

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:37,140
of pink time woohoo I got one of the

00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:41,100
best that works on earth because I got

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,630
lesson 1 millisecond ping time you know

00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,420
is it an average are you are we supposed

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,990
to ping every do a constant ping to

00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:50,670
every one of our customers endpoints and

00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,770
aggregate that together that's that's a

00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:55,340
lot of work and currently there there is

00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:58,170
nothing that does that out of box so now

00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,930
we have to develop something or if the

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,320
pay someone else to develop it we're a

00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:06,120
small company we got nine people and

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,890
there's no programmers in our company so

00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,590
we're not develop it in-house so now

00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,630
we're having to look at to pay someone

00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:17,450
outside the organization to develop it

00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:22,590
the next is formal complaints um under

00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:26,070
under title to there is a formal

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:29,130
mechanism for consumers to report bad

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:31,490
ISPs and theory that's a great thing

00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:35,370
and practice that's not so good um

00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:37,620
because consumers automatically think

00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:39,930
that every problem that exists in their

00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,630
home that is internet related is the

00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:45,330
ISPs fault I can't tell you how many

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,720
times it has been the customers fault

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:53,400
whether it is through stupidity through

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,380
ignorance through something deliver it

00:28:53,400 --> 00:29:00,570
failed equipment or poorly configured

00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:02,970
equipment there I'm on a mailing list

00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:06,000
that specializes for wireless eyes peas

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,070
and one of the gentleman's great little

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,620
bit you know how there's the bad drug

00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:14,040
commercials you know have you taken such

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:17,100
and such drug have you know have you had

00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:20,940
these symptoms if so call us bat you

00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:24,240
know 1 800 bad drug and the bit was

00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:26,340
about how long is it going to be until

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,770
there's you know commercials airing on

00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,620
TV to some of the most gullible people

00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:35,370
on earth you know have problem with your

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,860
ISP call us we can get your money and

00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:39,390
that's one of the problems I fear with a

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,040
formal complaint system also with a

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:46,230
formal complaint system it can be

00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,540
anonymous so the the reporter can stay

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:52,530
anonymous send a fill out a phone with

00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:55,050
the FCC now the FCC is going to contact

00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:58,590
the ISP on behalf of the anonymous

00:29:55,050 --> 00:30:01,890
customer and say you know one of your

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:03,300
customers is reporting this first off

00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,790
with it being anonymous we can't

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,770
actually drill down and identify the

00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,900
problem because we don't know who the

00:30:07,770 --> 00:30:11,730
problem exists you know if we don't know

00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,020
who it is we can't look at the endpoint

00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,480
and see if there was just a

00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:17,280
configuration issue and it's a you know

00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,800
what a normal tech support call could

00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,860
answer now is turn into a formal process

00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:26,370
also under the formal complaint system

00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,410
the complaint intact a anything in

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:32,610
attorneys fees because they complain to

00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:34,830
the FCC and the FCC then becomes the

00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:37,650
people that we have to deal with so the

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,410
FCC doesn't have a budget for lawyers

00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,480
that they have an entire building full

00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,950
of them and

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,309
we're a smaller HP we don't have

00:30:43,950 --> 00:30:51,000
attorneys on retainer so now we are

00:30:47,309 --> 00:30:53,940
having to pay our attorney to talk to

00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,500
the FCC and a then we're going back to

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,020
we're paying four to six hundred dollars

00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:02,100
an hour for this guy to sit on

00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,419
conference calls with the FCC to to deal

00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:10,940
with a problem that could have been

00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:10,940
fixed in a tech support call questions

00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:27,130
yes so the question was um those things

00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,930
are um that the you know here's stating

00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,890
that the problems are bad for small

00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:34,600
carriers and for large carriers it's not

00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:37,840
such an a problem yes I would completely

00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:41,500
agree the net neutrality is particularly

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:44,380
negative for smaller companies and rural

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:47,340
companies like even the world telephone

00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:50,110
companies like prtc which is in Laurens

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,930
South Carolina they probably only have

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:56,170
six thousand customers total I mean we

00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:59,080
have much less than that and so now

00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:01,900
where they had one lawyer who worked on

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,360
retainer they not a you know a normal

00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:07,120
business lawyer now they're having to

00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,730
put a telecom lawyer on retainer and you

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:13,060
know prtc probably could do that we

00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:16,210
can't we might have to fold up shop if

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:19,330
if we had legal action we may fold up

00:32:16,210 --> 00:32:21,070
shop instead of fight because it just

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:28,630
takes so much money to defend yourself

00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:32,200
even if you are in the right so um there

00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:33,970
is a in the title two came out there was

00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:37,570
a term that got used a lot is

00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:39,520
forbearance forbearance is a is a fancy

00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:44,530
government word for we're not going to

00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:47,590
enforce this right now or we will defer

00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:53,040
with defer enforcement so one of the

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:56,680
things that was deferred was USF fees so

00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:59,950
technically under title to internet

00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:03,370
connections are subject to that USF fee

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:05,860
of seventeen point four percent so think

00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:07,930
about your bills and how much seventeen

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,490
percent would add to your existing bill

00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:16,270
and every ISP would have to do that and

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:18,610
also one thing that's being talked about

00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:22,890
with the Lifeline program going back to

00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:25,900
the usf slide when it was talking about

00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:27,910
the Lifeline program it is being

00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:30,100
proposed right now that the Lifeline

00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,559
program be extended to internet

00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:36,009
connections so

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,379
low in to help where help to bridge the

00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:40,480
so-called digital divide is to provide

00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:44,169
low-income people with free internet

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,169
connections at their house um the only

00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:50,889
way the FCC could possibly pay for that

00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:56,799
is to charge us FPS on internet

00:33:50,889 --> 00:34:03,820
connections the next is price cap there

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:07,210
are price gap is used in World called

00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:11,470
rate of return companies rate of return

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:15,339
is basically where a telecom provider is

00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:17,710
in such a rural area that to even

00:34:15,339 --> 00:34:20,589
provide standard connections to normal

00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:24,190
people it would be so expensive that

00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:27,010
they could not function so the what the

00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:29,980
what the FCC does is saying you can only

00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:32,619
charge this for your product and we'll

00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:34,960
make up the difference these rate of

00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:37,089
return companies have a guaranteed i

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,349
think it's i think it's twelve percent

00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:42,700
profit garant by the federal government

00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:46,780
and there are a lot of these companies

00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:48,460
um I don't know these the I don't know I

00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,879
don't know of any of the ones in the

00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,800
area I forgot to look but they are

00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:55,990
typically in the more rural areas

00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,410
they're the small companies AT&T would

00:34:55,990 --> 00:35:01,660
not be in a rate of return area so and

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,480
then there's rate control another thing

00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:07,329
that was prepared is the rate control of

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,250
title to basically it goes it's similar

00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:11,200
to the price cat but it says you may not

00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:18,030
charge more or less than this price

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:20,170
because it may be unfair alright peering

00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:25,089
peering is a completely voluntary

00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:28,240
program or method that allows different

00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:30,220
networks to interconnect after all the

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,540
internet is a collection of

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:36,819
interconnected networks there is no big

00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:39,400
cloudy cloud cloud up in the sky that

00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:42,339
all the ISPs connect to know what it is

00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,490
is ISPs connect to each other and that's

00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:47,560
how the internet works so

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:51,040
how many of y'all are familiar with 56

00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:53,590
Marietta down in Atlanta good guess a

00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,640
telephone telephone folks or network

00:35:53,590 --> 00:36:02,200
folks back there so 56 Marietta is the

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:04,180
central central location where the vast

00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,570
majority of all traffic in the southeast

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:10,750
terminates essentially it think of a

00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:13,030
giant office building you know 20

00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:15,720
storeys high in the middle of downtown

00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:19,960
Atlanta that is nothing but data center

00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:24,910
n 56 Marietta they have so-called meet

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:27,130
me rooms we're basically ISPs will bring

00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:30,540
in their connections and you can

00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:33,700
literally walk over from one ISPs rack

00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,760
drag a fiber and plug it into another

00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,770
ISPs network and now this allows them to

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,230
communicate directly with each other

00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:43,750
without actually having to bury lines

00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:48,520
anywhere so ISPs bring all their lines

00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:51,340
in 256 Marietta and 56 Marriott as the

00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:54,550
address and they bring them into 56

00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,859
Marietta and then they can simply direct

00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:01,000
connect there's also what's known as the

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:04,930
public internet exchanges I think of a

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,060
massive switch logically wise because it

00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:09,580
physically it's actually separate but

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:12,880
think of a massive logical switch layer

00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:16,170
to switch that a bunch of ISPs plug into

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:22,150
I not only ISPs but content companies

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:23,770
network providers and with it so as an

00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:26,470
ISP we can bring a single connection

00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:29,530
into this public switch and now via

00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:32,680
layer 2 connection connect to hundreds

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:37,030
of other networks so if we bring in a

00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:39,790
connection to the peering exchange we

00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:42,160
pay for the we pay for the traffic to

00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:45,490
get from our location or so our data

00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,410
center down to 56 Marietta we also have

00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:49,869
to pay for what's known as cross-connect

00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:54,730
fee to the building owner which is I

00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:57,369
think equinox and then we then pay for a

00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,809
one-time or a when we pay a cost for the

00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:01,769
port

00:37:57,809 --> 00:38:04,469
the port on these exchanges a one gig is

00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:06,239
like three hundred dollars a month and a

00:38:04,469 --> 00:38:08,880
10 gig is like a thousand and you can

00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:12,989
even get 40 and 100 gig connections to

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,549
the public switch once you connect to

00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:18,809
the public's which you can then

00:38:14,549 --> 00:38:22,049
establish peering sessions with Netflix

00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:23,989
Amazon and YouTube and all the other

00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:27,839
different content companies along with

00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:32,489
level 3 18 teen charter and such and so

00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:35,759
once you establish that public pier then

00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:38,430
traffic to those sites from your network

00:38:35,759 --> 00:38:42,599
will flow over this much cheaper method

00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:45,119
um you know connecting to the public

00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,420
pier on a 10 gig connection could be as

00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,689
cheap as 25 cents a Meg where if you had

00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:56,400
to buy transit which is I'll get to

00:38:51,689 --> 00:38:59,279
transit in a second transit it could be

00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,229
maybe three dollars a Meg so you can

00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:03,539
take your foot for that traffic that's

00:39:01,229 --> 00:39:06,390
going to the public's which you can take

00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:10,890
it from costing three dollars a meg down

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:15,150
to 25 cents so it can be a dramatic cost

00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:17,390
savings and right now given particularly

00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:19,979
the residential side the netflix heavy

00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:21,900
side about eighty percent of your

00:39:19,979 --> 00:39:23,309
traffic can be offloaded to the public

00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,839
switch so you can be looking at

00:39:23,309 --> 00:39:30,679
significant cost savings if you can

00:39:24,839 --> 00:39:34,439
connect to the switch transit transit is

00:39:30,679 --> 00:39:39,029
basically when an isp buys a connection

00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:42,319
from another isp so one example is we

00:39:39,029 --> 00:39:45,059
could buy a connection to level three so

00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:48,329
we get access to all of level threes

00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:51,150
customers and we also get access to all

00:39:48,329 --> 00:39:53,819
of the customers connected to level

00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:56,160
three when you pair with someone you

00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:59,489
only get access to that networks

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,589
customers so if I here with charter that

00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:03,630
i'm only getting access to charters

00:40:01,589 --> 00:40:07,229
customers I can't get past charters

00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:10,410
network so that that and typically

00:40:07,229 --> 00:40:11,620
peering is called a statement free means

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,780
no money change

00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,360
hand because the the logic behind that

00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,190
is that charter is wanting to get to our

00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,530
customers and we're wanting to get the

00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:23,440
charters customers when you're a small

00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:25,270
isp no one really does state no one

00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,610
really does settlement free peering with

00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:31,930
you because it's it's it's not their

00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:33,690
benefit to do it so transit costs are

00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:37,240
also very sensitive to your location

00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:39,370
buying transit down in Atlanta hurricane

00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:41,320
electric cells you can get transit for

00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:42,520
on a 10 gig connection you can get as

00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,660
low as two dollars a month or two

00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:49,900
dollars a mega month so that's really

00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:51,700
cheap that same connection in Greenville

00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:55,570
which is considered a tier two tier

00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:56,680
three market you know Greenville's not

00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:00,700
that smallest in the middle between

00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,950
green between Charlotte and Atlanta it

00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,920
could be for that same connection we

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:09,040
could be paying ten dollars a mega month

00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,530
so if we could get down to the exchange

00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,810
we can reduce our costs because now

00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:16,780
we're cutting out hurricane electrics

00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:18,370
having to bring the network up public

00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:21,280
peering versus private pairing that's

00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:22,920
the private peering is done in the meet

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,640
me room where you be we're basically

00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:30,510
companies walk fiber to each other I'm

00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:33,810
going back to the netflix comcast thing

00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:36,370
and I said I'll bring it up in peering

00:41:33,810 --> 00:41:42,690
there was a lot of conflicting reports

00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:47,260
on this what I believe happened is

00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:51,400
Netflix was wanting to place equipment

00:41:47,260 --> 00:41:53,110
and a comcast data center and this

00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:58,150
equipment does require internet

00:41:53,110 --> 00:42:01,960
connection it it that equipment using

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:04,390
the open connect program will will will

00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,240
saturate a 10 gig connection for five

00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:09,490
hours every night so it is a significant

00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,370
burden to support this equipment

00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:14,770
including the power the netflix

00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:18,940
equipment is very dense so it's a lot of

00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:23,350
power a lot of cooling and comcast said

00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:24,820
no you can't do it for free pay us i pay

00:42:23,350 --> 00:42:25,530
us to put the equipment in our data

00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:30,630
center

00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:32,040
um and so the way it was considered in

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:33,270
the news i think is wrong because they

00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,000
don't they don't have a technical

00:42:33,270 --> 00:42:37,830
understanding and also both companies

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,710
signed an NDA so you're not getting

00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:42,750
anything out of them so a lot of what

00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,240
happened in that situation is

00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,550
speculation like i just made that's what

00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:51,090
I think happened met where that actually

00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:55,790
happened or not that's the last word

00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:55,790
it's last slide any questions yes

00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:09,450
ubiquiti shop where ubiquity shop yep um

00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,120
ubiquity has done some amazing things in

00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:15,840
the wireless industry prior to ubiquity

00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:18,090
a cpe which is installed on a customer's

00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:21,030
house with costing over three hundred

00:43:18,090 --> 00:43:22,350
dollars a pop and then ubiquity came out

00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:25,710
and they started charging eighty-nine

00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:27,390
dollars a piece and they gained a lot of

00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:30,300
market share and they drove the price

00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:43,740
point of all of the wisp equipment way

00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:46,320
down yeah yeah so the statement was they

00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:48,210
been accused of some potential GPL

00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,540
violations with some of their code I am

00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:54,690
NOT a I'm not a patent lawyer or not or

00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,370
software licensed lawyer so I know I am

00:43:54,690 --> 00:44:03,330
the wrong person to ask about that you

00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:07,530
can do your own research on that yeah so

00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:10,800
are our primary competition is charter

00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:14,010
and AT&T on the residential side on the

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:20,370
commercial side it is a company called

00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:22,920
spirit and AT&T again and I know we're

00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:25,490
the only wireless isp in the area and

00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:28,920
with we like to keep it that way

00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:32,790
Greenville South Carolina and the

00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,160
question was who is our competition and

00:44:32,790 --> 00:44:36,349
are there any other wireless ISPs in our

00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:46,819
area

00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:48,769
uh the the question was if I was FCC how

00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:51,970
would I fix the problem I come back at

00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:54,440
it was a solution looking for a problem

00:44:51,970 --> 00:44:58,239
that the problem really didn't exist and

00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,769
again it was it was come it was

00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:05,329
Netflix's and other content companies

00:45:00,769 --> 00:45:07,249
heavy lobbying that because they wanted

00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:11,359
their business models to stay the same

00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:13,670
there was there was a lot of AT&T and

00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:17,329
Comcast I think we're testing meter

00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:28,849
based billing and Netflix about

00:45:17,329 --> 00:45:31,460
themselves um so the question was do I

00:45:28,849 --> 00:45:33,559
think it's a good idea to do meter based

00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:38,630
billing I absolutely love the idea

00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:40,880
because you're because right now whether

00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:44,509
the you whether whether the user uses

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:47,329
almost nothing we have some we have some

00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:49,309
elderly couples that use 500 Meg's a

00:45:47,329 --> 00:45:51,769
month and they're paying the same amount

00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:54,319
as someone who streams netflix all day

00:45:51,769 --> 00:45:57,619
in paying sick and downloading six

00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:00,499
hundred gigabytes and a month so if we

00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:02,779
go if we go to meter based billing their

00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:05,390
their bill we would do something similar

00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:09,920
as utility company where they do a base

00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:12,319
charge plus usage so we'd have a base

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,119
charge um we have a base charge of about

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:17,900
you know ten fifteen dollars a month

00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:19,369
plus a price per gig so for that elderly

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,289
couple they could be looking at a

00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:23,749
fifteen dollar internet bill where the

00:46:21,289 --> 00:46:26,450
person who you know put puts the Yule

00:46:23,749 --> 00:46:31,069
Log on netflix and lets it stream all

00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:33,440
day long would would think twice you

00:46:31,069 --> 00:46:34,849
know what like like the power company

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,400
has done a great thing about convincing

00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:39,079
people turn their stuff off turn your

00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,289
lights off when you leave the room well

00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:45,309
we need to do the same thing turn off

00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:48,309
the Yule Log when you're not in the room

00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:48,309
yes

00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:12,310
they're trying to implement that I am

00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:17,230
NOT in Todd so the statement was that

00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:20,710
comcast is doing semi usage-based

00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:23,020
billing and the Charleston market he was

00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:25,180
saying that they give you 300 gigs and

00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:28,270
then they charge an overage that's

00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:30,610
Kwazii usage-based billing where I'm

00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:32,620
talking is like what the power company

00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:35,140
does is they charge you literally for

00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:37,000
every kilowatt not give you you can use

00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:45,520
100 kilowatts and then if you go over

00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:47,260
then pay something yes I I'll get more

00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,700
into the bic word equipment in my eyes p

00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,700
talk yes Ethan

00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,030
you

00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:25,680
so his statement was a statement /

00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:28,230
question was about caching and how some

00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:32,430
ISPs have a Netflix cash box and others

00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:35,190
don't unfortunately there is no way to

00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:39,750
cash netflix content without Netflix's

00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:41,910
involvement ssl ssl brakeset all they

00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:44,369
have to do is enable us to sell and it

00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:46,559
breaks caching also the way they design

00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:50,520
their applications also makes it

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:55,200
impossible to cash so when you actually

00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:59,280
win an ISP gets a Netflix caching

00:48:55,200 --> 00:49:05,309
appliance that appliance gets installed

00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:09,359
with one of Netflix's IP addresses so so

00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:14,849
that netflix IP address lives on the

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:17,460
ISPs network and so through DNS and some

00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:20,130
tricks that netflix plays they will

00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,309
redirect the content to the cash box

00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:26,369
because first off amazon also netflix

00:49:23,309 --> 00:49:30,180
also knows what content is on that cash

00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:32,549
box so if that particular video is not

00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,980
on the cash box then they'll go and send

00:49:32,549 --> 00:49:38,250
it out of the ISPs network but if the

00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,869
content is on the cash box then Netflix

00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:44,720
will direct that stream down to the cash

00:49:39,869 --> 00:49:44,720
box yes

00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,320
you

00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:06,760
sir so from the technical point of view

00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:12,000
it doesn't matter um gotta keep

00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:15,430
forgetting so the question was about

00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,730
should competing services be treated

00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:21,520
equal from a technical point of view it

00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:23,260
doesn't matter from a political point of

00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,790
view and an economic point of view it

00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,130
does matter and that there's a lot of

00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:32,730
gray area that's you know that that's a

00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:35,760
great discussion over rum and coke so

00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:40,000
but and he explicitly brought up the

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:43,420
tmobile streaming stuff so I am

00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,390
perfectly fine with if if a Content

00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:49,300
company wants to come and pay to help

00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:52,330
support ok and offset the cost of

00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:55,350
delivering the content to our customers

00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:58,780
I am fine with that not going against

00:50:55,350 --> 00:51:01,560
your data cap because essentially you

00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:04,720
shifted the cost away from the end user

00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:07,420
to the provider to the content provider

00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:09,730
so I am okay with that under title to

00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,770
that's explicitly not allowed so I don't

00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:14,550
know if t-mobile is going to be able to

00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:14,550
continue doing that

00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:37,740
okay so that the statement was about

00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:42,619
email and trading treating contests

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:47,609
internal email the same level as Gmail

00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:50,910
so email is probably not the greatest

00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:54,359
example because it's just so little data

00:51:50,910 --> 00:51:57,089
usage it makes it first off it doesn't

00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:00,839
need high latency or if not late-season

00:51:57,089 --> 00:52:08,940
sensitive and it's not high bandwidth so

00:52:00,839 --> 00:52:11,520
so I would have a me personally I would

00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:16,369
have a problem with an ISP favoring

00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:29,339
their own service over an outside party

00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:31,260
yes so the statement was is if meter

00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:34,589
billing is such a great thing how come I

00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:37,170
don't do it um well I come back to we

00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:39,089
can't be an evil is P because if we're

00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:48,030
the only game in town that offers meter

00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:50,369
billing customers hate me to billing it

00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,010
would provide a lower bill for some

00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:55,290
users the other set of users would have

00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:58,010
a lot higher of a bill and they may have

00:52:55,290 --> 00:53:00,839
to change the behavior so consumers hate

00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:02,460
would hate metered billing so if we were

00:53:00,839 --> 00:53:05,190
the only game in town that did meet her

00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:07,109
billing we would lose all all at least

00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:15,000
all of our residential customers with a

00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:16,980
JumpShip and go to someone else it would

00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,540
that so the statement was what if all

00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,010
the low usage customers flock to us then

00:53:21,540 --> 00:53:24,630
the service we couldn't afford to keep

00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:27,930
the service going at fifteen dollars a

00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:32,130
month per account so it would drive all

00:53:27,930 --> 00:53:33,630
of the profitable customers away because

00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:35,030
that mean there is a break-even no

00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:36,920
matter how much data you use

00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:38,480
there is a break-even of having that

00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:40,250
person as a customer from a billing

00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,230
point of view from an installation point

00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,090
of view and a network usage point of

00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:46,160
view so it basically drive the

00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:48,410
profitable customers away to another

00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:51,260
provider if we're the arm provided doing

00:53:48,410 --> 00:53:53,270
it in town now if charter or a tnt

00:53:51,260 --> 00:53:55,550
starts doing it on the residential

00:53:53,270 --> 00:53:57,590
service in ra we'd give it a serious

00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:12,670
hard thought about doing it in our

00:53:57,590 --> 00:54:16,450
network yes yeah his statement was that

00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:19,460
ISPs from almost day 1 have been selling

00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:22,780
unlimited usage and at this point it

00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:25,130
would be very hard and not very user

00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,650
users would not like we're only not

00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:32,120
metered billing but then again it is the

00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:34,250
most the most fairway at charging for

00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:38,300
what people for the strain they actually

00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:40,400
put on the network and a little bit more

00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:44,240
about the usage-based billing is you can

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:48,020
set up tears based on time frame so if

00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,870
you want to download a gigabyte at 8pm

00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:53,480
when everyone else wants to that might

00:54:50,870 --> 00:54:56,270
cost more than if you download that

00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:58,700
after midnight so after midnight there's

00:54:56,270 --> 00:55:00,920
so little usage on a residential network

00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,590
you could actually say three data and

00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:05,450
this is actually what some of the

00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:08,740
hughesnet the satellite internet company

00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:12,230
actually does they actually have

00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:16,090
different data caps based on the time

00:55:12,230 --> 00:55:16,090
frame of the day yes

00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:39,290
so the statement was about that some you

00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:44,690
to some utilities will allow you to pay

00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:46,640
based on last year's average for a small

00:55:44,690 --> 00:55:48,530
company that would be a billing and

00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:57,680
administrative hell that I would not

00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:59,960
like to visit yes in the back so the

00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:07,460
statement was um would it be practical

00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:09,830
do not 95 percentile um yes but the

00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:11,810
customers that left that accidentally

00:56:09,830 --> 00:56:16,520
left their netflix stream on the Yule

00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:18,650
Log left it on and and their their price

00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,380
point was here and suddenly they got a

00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:30,290
bill that was three hundred dollars over

00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:31,020
their normal would pitch a fit yes yes

00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:33,030
it is

00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:37,740
very common thing for people especially

00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:40,830
um so it is a common thing for people to

00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:42,690
leave netflix on during a long period

00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:45,570
particularly with families with young

00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:49,440
kids netflix has seen become almost of a

00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:51,810
babysitter and we also a lot of our

00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,860
residential users are actually home

00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:59,760
schoolers so they they're watching a lot

00:56:55,860 --> 00:57:23,940
like Netflix adda me and they're using a

00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:26,010
lot of data so the statement was some

00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:29,130
clients will basically do a check-in to

00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:31,170
see if you're still watching the Yule

00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:33,690
Log particularly with the you log on

00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:40,040
netflix with a special video that they

00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:40,040
did not do that on yes

00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:58,369
um what type of is be okay

00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:36,860
so his statement that is bandwidth

00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:40,510
really are big cost versus the other

00:58:36,860 --> 00:58:44,870
expenses no but to increase capacity

00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:47,210
support the these users that are very

00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:51,110
heavy users is very expensive equipment

00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:53,990
we're a wireless isp and we're currently

00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:56,570
with ubiquity we can do let's say a

00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:59,750
six-mile link that is capable of megs

00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:03,830
for less than a thousand dollars to go

00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:06,230
over to go over that mark to in that 50

00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:09,100
megs we would have to upgrade the link

00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:11,960
to something like staff technica a

00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:14,210
license link you now went from a

00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:18,440
thousand-dollar link that was capable of

00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:22,190
50 megs to a twelve thousand dollar link

00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:24,350
that is capable of 300 megs so it is a

00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:36,050
it represents a significant costs

00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:38,060
increase alright so okay so I know some

00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,580
of y'all gettin hungry I'm I have

00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:44,060
reserved one of the classrooms by

00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:46,460
Jupiter broadcast for just a giant QA

00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:49,340
session about any topic that y'all want

00:59:46,460 --> 00:59:51,590
to talk about so I'm going to break it

00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:54,020
here and head over there anyone is

00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:55,850
welcome to come and I will keep talking

00:59:54,020 --> 01:00:00,220
and keep answering questions about any

00:59:55,850 --> 01:00:00,220
topic thank you

01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:33,010
citrix xenserver gives you everything

01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:35,980
you need to integrate manage and

01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:38,110
automate a virtual data center all on an

01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,540
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:43,270
platform and at a third of the cost of

01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,980
other solutions but why even bother with

01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:47,140
virtualizing your server infrastructure

01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:49,030
in the first place well let's say you

01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:51,310
have a traditional one server to one

01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:53,200
application architecture but you're

01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:55,660
running out of resources and performance

01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,960
is suffering once you order new server

01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:00,820
hardware you'll wait for delivery

01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,730
configure it install your business

01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:06,520
application stage and test the server

01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:08,710
and finally add it to your production

01:01:06,520 --> 01:01:10,900
farm if you've been through this process

01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:13,420
before you know it can take weeks or

01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,280
even months you also know it's a

01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:17,230
manually intensive process that will

01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,560
burden your team every time you outgrow

01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:22,330
your current setup with a virtual server

01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:25,210
solution you could accomplish all of

01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:27,820
that in less than half a day server

01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:29,650
virtualization software separates the OS

01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:32,140
and application from the underlying

01:01:29,650 --> 01:01:34,300
server hardware and with multiple

01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:36,040
virtual machines on a single server you

01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:39,070
can use each of them to run different

01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:40,780
os's and applications this makes it

01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:42,550
possible to move your virtual machines

01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:44,560
from one piece of hardware to another

01:01:42,550 --> 01:01:46,810
whenever you want to maximize

01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,760
utilization simplify maintenance or

01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:51,100
recover from a hardware failure and

01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:54,100
without slowing down your applications

01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:57,160
or users clearly server virtualization

01:01:54,100 --> 01:02:00,100
provides big benefits and Citrix

01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:02,320

your customers rely on your website or

01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:04,720
application if it's slower

01:03:02,350 --> 01:03:07,660
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:09,490
and costs you money keeping your

01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:12,990
business critical systems humming along

01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:15,270
requires insight into what they're doing

01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:17,250
your system metrics tells stories

01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:19,290
stories that can reveal performance

01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:21,600
bottlenecks resource limitations and

01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:23,160
other problems but how do you keep an

01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:25,800
eye on all of your systems performance

01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:28,830
metrics in real-time and record this

01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,600
data for later analysis enter longview

01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:32,610
the new way to see what's really going

01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,770
on under the hood the long view

01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:36,840
dashboard lets you visualize the status

01:03:34,770 --> 01:03:39,270
of all your systems providing you with a

01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:42,690
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:03:39,270 --> 01:03:45,270
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:46,980
load and network usage click a specific

01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:49,410
system to access its individual

01:03:46,980 --> 01:03:51,920
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:54,330
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:56,010
comprehensive network data including

01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,320
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:59,880
available on the network tab and disk

01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:01,800
rights and free space on the disk

01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:04,650
stabbed while the process Explorer

01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:07,170
displays usage statistics for individual

01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:09,360
processes the system info tab shows

01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:11,580
listening services active connections

01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,710
and available updates adding long view

01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:15,420
to a system is easy just click the

01:04:13,710 --> 01:04:17,580
button copy the one line installation

01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:20,010
command then run the command on your

01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:21,690
linux system to complete the process the

01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:23,910
agent will begin collecting data and

01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:25,760
sending it to longview then the graphs

01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,310
start rolling

01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,740
use longview to gain visibility into

01:04:28,310 --> 01:04:34,480
your servers so when your website or app

01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:34,480
heats up it stays up

01:06:07,810 --> 01:06:09,870
