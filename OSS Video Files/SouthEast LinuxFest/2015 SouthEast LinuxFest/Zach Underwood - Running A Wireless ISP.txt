all right so I guess I'll go and get

00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:08,370
started it's a bit of a late crowd bit

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,920
of a slow crowd today so I'm not gonna

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,480
with global vision not sure how many of

00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:17,840
y'all went to my net neutrality talk so

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,369
I am from Greenville South Carolina and

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,029
I work for a company called global

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:29,640
vision it started as a dial-up ISP in

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:32,430
1996 we had a I was around then I was

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,100
born in 1990 so what are we going

00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,290
preference that I wasn't with the

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,640
company then but they had a t1 that they

00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:44,340
used for their internet connection and

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,140
then had a bunch of phone lines coming

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,170
in for people to dial out to the public

00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:51,780
internet with today our cut today our

00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:55,110
clients range from large companies to we

00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,989
thought we have about 40% of our

00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:01,170
customer base is residential the other

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:05,339
60% is commercial we do everything from

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,140
a three Meg residential connection to we

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:10,920
got a hundred by hundred dedicated

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,380
connection to a business and we're

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,490
particularly a Wireless ISP so that

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:21,119
means our last mile access method is

00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:23,880
some form of wireless technology and we

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,090
are not when on a mobile carrier our

00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,380
wireless is fixed so we install a piece

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:33,450
of equipment on a building and then and

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:39,360
then it points up at one of one of our

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:41,189
towers no we we our equipment is

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:47,960
actually five gigahertz based and it

00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:53,030
uses the ADA 211 spec so I also do

00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:56,159
Greenville towers which is a offshoot

00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,820
for some of the work that I do and what

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,770
Greenville towers do its tower climbing

00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:06,960
coming cellphone towers that is made on

00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:09,840
a very cold day fixing em a a thern ette

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,060
drop because another cellphone carrier

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,630
damaged it when they were moving their

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,630
own equipment

00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:21,240
it doesn't look that high until you see

00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:25,480
it from my point of view that is that is

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:27,220
this first set of arms right here is at

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,860
a hundred feet so that is about a

00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:33,840
hundred and thirty feet in the air and

00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,840
the cars look kind of tiny from there

00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,290
what's unique about running a Wireless

00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:46,210
ISP is we're a small company we have

00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:48,430
nine I think nine people and so there is

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,580
there's not a whole lot of that's not my

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:55,600
job or that's not in my job description

00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:59,650
and so prior to me coming to global

00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:05,620
vision we had to pay someone $50 an hour

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:07,240
to do this work and this work you know

00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,150
some of this you know this could easily

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,160
be an eight-hour job to do install one

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:14,920
antenna because particularly running the

00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,600
cable on the tower can be quite

00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,630
difficult because it has to be secured

00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:24,870
every five feet down the tower and that

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:30,070
could be a two hour job just by itself

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:35,500
so I got trained I went down to Georgia

00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:36,880
and became a certified tower claimer one

00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:40,150
thing interesting about tower climbing

00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:42,100
is fire departments are not your friends

00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,320
because they do not know how to rescue

00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,830
you from anything above their ladder

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,020
bunk

00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:48,790
their ladder truck bail basically

00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:53,770
they'll pull up their ladder truck go oh

00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:56,950
 we can't get up there and then that

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,530
that's where the problem start there was

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,290
a case in California where a guy was on

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,440
a cell phone tower he was 135 feet in

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:09,540
the air and he fell and his harness

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:12,850
caught him so he's now hanging six feet

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,430
so he was out on a platform and he's now

00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:17,410
hanging six feet below the platform so

00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,710
we can't pull himself back up because he

00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:22,270
can't actually reach and so the you know

00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,520
Fire Department it's called they come

00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:27,190
they pull up their buck they pull up

00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,280
their ladder truck and they raise it

00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:34,810
damn it's only 100 feet so then they

00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,820
call a Construction Yard we know a

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:40,630
rental construction or rent rental

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:45,540
company to get a cherry but cherry

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:48,610
picker man-lift it's only 120 feet so

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:51,070
finally one of the guys co-workers

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,840
called another tower climbing company

00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,980
that was two counties over

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,200
it took them 45 minutes to get there and

00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:03,250
within ten minutes of being on on seat

00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,160
that tower company climbed up rigged

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:09,130
ropes and repelled down and lowered the

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,690
gentlemen down to the ground so the more

00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,390
of the story with this is you cannot

00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:16,030
count doing tower climbing you cannot

00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,580
count on local fire and rescue to

00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:22,690
actually rescue you so that's why we

00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:24,880
train for rescue I love it

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,860
I love it when like heck five or

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,990
something like that talks about extreme

00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,410
outdoor wireless and they're still

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:35,110
measuring their links and feet any and

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,300
in the wireless industry particularly

00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:40,810
the outdoor wireless industry the wisp

00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:43,690
industry met measuring wireless links

00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:48,070
and number of feet is a bit of a joke

00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:49,210
our longest link is 44 our personal link

00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,820
is 44 miles

00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,880
it goes from downtown Greenville South

00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:57,160
Carolina two cashiers North Carolina and

00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,680
hits a mountain our building that we're

00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:07,090
on is a 335 feet building and it's got a

00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:08,530
35 foot Tower on the top so it it is the

00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:11,940
second tallest building in the state of

00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:15,040
South Carolina and we're not using

00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:17,290
Cantina and antennas we're not building

00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,050
these out of Pringle cans we are buying

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:25,680
commercial antennas that we then hook

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:25,680
radios to and actually hold on

00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:52,490
so the however with the with the same

00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:56,479
equipment that we use right now assuming

00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:58,759
we can get enough vertical elevation the

00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,400
longest record link so far this

00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:04,090
equipment is a hundred and forty miles

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:09,550
and that that link did 155 megabits

00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:13,400
using five gigahertz the link ran from a

00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:15,470
8500 foot mountain near la to a a

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,020
thousand foot mountain at just outside

00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,900
of Las Vegas and they basically went

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,570
mountain top mountain top the problem

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,550
when you get at 140 feet isn't one

00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:28,430
hundred four hundred and forty miles is

00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:31,639
not trees it's the curvature of the

00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:33,530
earth so you have to get high enough to

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,199
just compensate for the curvature of the

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:38,810
earth and it typically is in the

00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:41,620
neighborhood of several thousand feet

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:46,580
mountaintops that you have to do that

00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:48,440
the next is we we just started we

00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,039
recently using a new product from

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:56,090
ubiquity called it is called the air

00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:59,120
fiber air fiber 24 HD it uses 24

00:07:56,090 --> 00:08:02,509
gigahertz which has very little

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,969
interference on it because 24 Giga

00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:11,090
Hertz's is it's so high in the spectrum

00:08:04,969 --> 00:08:14,389
that rain droplets attenuate it so it's

00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:18,199
not also walls walls does horrible

00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:22,370
things so it's not it's the frequency is

00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:26,509
special because home users would never

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:31,759
use it so we can use 24 Giga Hertz to

00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:34,250
deliver 2,000 megabits that's that's

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,370
aggregated both ways or we can do one

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:41,229
gig full duplex at in the Greenville

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:46,690
climate we can do about five miles and

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:50,990
if you out in the desert Southwest where

00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:55,130
it is very dry you could you could do 20

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,060
miles on the same frequencies so it's a

00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,240
matter of the distance

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,450
so this is one of the antennas that we

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,450
use I'm gonna charming the camera this

00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:11,790
is one of the sectors that we use it is

00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:13,920
a 120 degrees wide and that this sector

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:18,180
is what we install on a tower and allow

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:24,480
clients to connect this this metal

00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:27,330
around it is aftermarket RF armor these

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,140
radios are inexpensive or so the

00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:33,930
antennas are inexpensive so they don't

00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,940
have the best shielding on them so if we

00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,370
were to mount for these without our

00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:41,130
farmer we would actually in end up

00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,660
interfering with ourselves so we install

00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:45,030
these aftermarket and we can actually

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,830
about double the performance because we

00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:51,330
cut the self interfere interference

00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:53,700
almost to nothing this with with the

00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,040
standard rocket in five from ubiquity

00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,560
this sector can do about seventy five

00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,870
Meg's aggregate so that means all the

00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,200
plus connected to it can push about

00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:06,420
seventy five may set megabits when

00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,330
you're selling three five and ten Meg

00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:12,000
packages you we can fit about 30

00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,920
customers on here before performance

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,010
really starts degrading and then we'll

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:21,180
just put another one on the tower the

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:23,130
and and and this package is not terribly

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,230
expensive I think it's about five

00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:29,280
hundred dollars for the radio the

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:32,250
antenna shielding and amount so it's not

00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:38,460
crazy expensive and this this particular

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:43,080
unit is a nineteen DB DB is a way of

00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:47,430
measuring the strength of a basically

00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:51,420
the power gain of an antenna and so that

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:54,960
the the sectors are 19 however the the

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:58,550
equipment that was used for the 140 mile

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:03,480
link was a dish there's a parabolic dish

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:07,470
that was 34 DB so a little bit about RF

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:09,330
so when I got to remember the rules

00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:10,560
because it's been a while since I've so

00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:15,690
when you go up three

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:17,730
Phoebe no it's when you go up one DB you

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,450
double the power when you go up three DB

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:25,290
you 10x the power so we're going from a

00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:28,350
nineteen yeah nineteen DB on this

00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:32,580
antenna to a 34 DB so it is worlds

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,740
difference and also it's much focused so

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:38,430
instead of spreading the RF energy out

00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,230
like this it's like this so that's how

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:43,740
we we're able to complete these long

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:47,010
links and the wisp industry we cannot

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:50,900
afford to pay for licensed spectrum like

00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:54,750
the cellphone carriers can we don't have

00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:57,210
you know five hundred thousand to get

00:11:54,750 --> 00:12:00,630
five hundred thousand or a couple of

00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:02,760
million dollars to get spectrum just in

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,540
the city limits of Greenville South

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,430
Carolina so we rely on unlicensed

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,839
spectrum particularly five five

00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:14,839
gigahertz

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:17,760
unfortunately so do home routers so does

00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:20,250
Comcast deploying their hotspots on

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,700
telephone poles and stuff like that so

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:27,570
five gigahertz is a is a unique animal

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:30,870
about yes it is attenuated by trees so

00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:34,440
five gigahertz cannot penetrate trees at

00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:36,060
long distance so that helps cut down a

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,950
little bit of the interference from

00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:41,760
Comcast

00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:45,900
but there there are some operators of

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,089
this equipment that in a Comcast urban

00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:50,370
area would do a channel scan and

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:52,860
basically show all the access points

00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,680
that the antenna can see and it'll be

00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:00,180
like three it can see 300 access points

00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:04,560
that all belong to Comcast now there is

00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,820
some new frequency or if some frequency

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,830
that's coming up under different rules

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:14,510
now and that's a 3.65 the some

00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:17,910
politician put a nice name on it as

00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:20,850
civilian citizens broadband or something

00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,470
like that some fancy word that I could

00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,270
makes it more confusing

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:27,810
so essentially what it is

00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:32,160
is what is unique about 365 is their

00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:34,050
licensing it per census track so in an

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,960
urban area a census track could

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:41,880
literally be a block as one city block

00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:44,730
so we can get exclusive use of part of

00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:48,120
that frequency for that city block oh

00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,010
and I'm more you know suburban area that

00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,010
might be a couple of square miles and we

00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:55,560
get exclusive use for that frequency and

00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:59,700
it's relatively inexpensive to get those

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,590
frequencies using the equipment that we

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,010
would actually use for the unlicensed

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:08,250
would be from a vendor called tell rad

00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:11,580
the tell red equipment is LTE based so

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:15,840
it uses the LTE spec but it runs on 365

00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:18,180
but it is it is still fixed wireless not

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:21,830
you know mobile cell phone roaming and

00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:26,460
with that with the LTE we can do a

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:29,960
single sector can do over 500 Meg's so

00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:34,710
we can now compete directly with a

00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:42,390
charter and both speed and price doing

00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:45,380
Wireless so LTE does add some latency it

00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:49,170
would average about 30 milliseconds from

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:52,260
from the CPE from the customer premise

00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,400
equipment mounted on the house to right

00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,080
as it exits our network so if you're

00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,930
thinking if you're thinking latency to

00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:05,040
Google you like Google's 88 you'd be

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:09,540
looking at about 40 milliseconds yeah

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:11,190
and yeah however with the with with the

00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,050
ubiquity quipment that we have in place

00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:17,760
right now it is actually incredibly low

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:21,240
latency most of our Wireless customers

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:26,630
see single digit ping times 288 at 8

00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:29,340
which it charters I my home on charter

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:33,330
because I'm not in our service footprint

00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:34,890
and I the best I've ever seen is about

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,130
35 milliseconds to eight eight eight

00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:40,330
eight

00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:44,100
so we're doing single digits which is

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:53,190
pretty incredible and the gamers love it

00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:53,190
yes yes

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,829
Technica 4:11 gigahertz

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:27,720
okay so did did you follow the

00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:33,600
manufacturers recommendation when they

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:36,990
passed the link then if if the antenna

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:40,110
is aligned properly then you should be

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,870
getting the signal strength numbers that

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,570
the that the spec sheet says then you

00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:49,620
should get the reliability that the spec

00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,570
sheet says which we have Assaf technical

00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,240
link which is 11 gigahertz which is very

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,550
similar to yours and it's a six-mile

00:16:54,240 --> 00:17:01,740
shot with two 3-foot dishes on both

00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:08,060
sides and in the most heavy down storm

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:08,060
it will drop one level modulation also

00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,390
