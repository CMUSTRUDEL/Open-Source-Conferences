alright i love this i feel like a news

00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,790
anchor person now so maybe those will be

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
news you can use i'm going to talk about

00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,780
software patent litigation and what

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,810
we've learned when something no matter

00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,760
how nefarious goes on for decades you

00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:23,150
end up with lots of data that we can

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,680
look at and analyze trends from so we

00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:25,820
are going to take a look at some of the

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,060
things that have happened since we

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:31,460
started a software patent litigation and

00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,840
where we are today first of all I'm not

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:37,910
a lawyer and I work with some lawyers

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,240
and the ones i work with having to be

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,950
very nice but I'm not a lawyer which of

00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,080
course means that this is not legal

00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,910
advice aside from the fact that I'm not

00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,490
addressing you specifically but speaking

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:51,560
generally you should also not consider

00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,200
this legal advice that you should go

00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:56,960
make expensive decisions based on if you

00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:59,090
have a patent suit that's happening with

00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,650
your company you should get an actual

00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:06,230
lawyer I say that because you'd be

00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,790
surprised even when I was a working

00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:09,170
reception people would try and get free

00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:13,370
legal advice out of me at the Free

00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:17,000
Software Foundation so understandable

00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:20,960
legal advice is expensive anyway so the

00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,560
big picture um in LA in last year in the

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,100
u.s. 2014 300,000 new patents were

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,720
granted which is a lot right they're not

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:31,550
all software patents which I guess is

00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:34,250
kind of the good news but somewhere

00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,510
between fifty and sixty five percent of

00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,330
them depending on how you classify

00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:40,520
software or software related inventions

00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:42,650
have something to do with technology

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:48,040
software or software and business

00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:51,380
methods so that's a lot of new patents a

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,090
wise that you might wonder it's it's not

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,870
because we had three hundred and

00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:59,479
thousand new ideas about fixing things

00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,940
we identified three hundred thousand new

00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:04,490
problems so in the legal profession we

00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,900
call this functional claiming but I'll

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,760
break that down for you it basically

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,080
means you go to the US Patent Office and

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,390
you say I've identified a problem and

00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,640
I plan to fix it with software on a

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:17,530
computer but don't worry I'm not going

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,750
to pester you with any source code or

00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,730
any code of any type I'm just going to

00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,950
tell you that I have identified a

00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,960
problem and that I plan to fix it using

00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:28,780
software on a computer newest Patent

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:30,820
Office says well alright if you cover

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,760
that with enough legal verbiage and some

00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,750
confusing diagrams i'll give it to you

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,360
that's paraphrasing i don't think they

00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,930
actually say that but that is kind of

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,540
how it shakes out and so they there are

00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,210
some problems of the patent office a1

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,920
they're sort of incentivized to grant

00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,840
patents so they're more likely to grant

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,310
patents than not grant them and that

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,560
number has actually been going up it

00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,330
used to be hovering a little under fifty

00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,790
percent but they're now at about a sixty

00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:00,310
to seventy percent granting rate with

00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,250
applications they get a little bit more

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:04,840
fees for the office when they grant

00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,370
patents than when they don't so it's

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,890
kind of like you know they're working on

00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,720
commission and they also don't get

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:12,490
enough time to look at each individual

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,010
patent so even if they were trying to do

00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,739
their work they're asked to assume that

00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,650
a patent application is worthy and then

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,580
spend a not very long amount of time

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,160
trying to figure out if there's a way to

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,989
deem it as a non worthy patent so there

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:33,880
are some problems there uh but

00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:37,300
inventions actual new inventions are not

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:41,650
one of them just kind of put that in

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:43,630
context this is the US utility patents

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:48,220
issued over time so you can see how that

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:50,019
number is going so another couple things

00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,510
I thought were interesting about fifty

00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:54,730
percent of those patents were given two

00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,950
inventors outside the US which is

00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,690
interesting I go sometimes I leave the

00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:01,360
country and I talked to folks about

00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:02,590
software patents and i usually get

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,200
something along the lines of the

00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:08,500
question of like man why are you all so

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,820
crazy over there and you know i have to

00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,640
say like well you know I don't work for

00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:15,220
the US patent office i'm like not the

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,140
president i don't really make policy i

00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,080
just kind of get to talk about it

00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,789
they're like oh well so you don't know

00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,400
animal e i don't know what no idea why

00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:26,710
we're crazy but it's not only us

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,780
um we know that a lot of the patents

00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,600
issued in the US patent system are going

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,130
to folks outside the US which brings me

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,509
to the next bit we're going to look at

00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,900
some of those things that are happening

00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:40,330
outside of the US so these are software

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,770
or software related patents issued to

00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:47,440
date like and today it means from like

00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,990
the 70s which is when they have digital

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,940
data on lens org this is actually really

00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:55,000
fascinating if you end up wanting to

00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,530
dive really deep but you can see this is

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,110
one of those things in which we are

00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:05,289
winning here in the US so Australia and

00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:08,500
the European Patent Office of doing with

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:10,810
the valiant effort here uh and China is

00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,810
sort of they've just started in the last

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,990
like decade to catch up on this and

00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,970
typically all of these um there would be

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:23,020
some overlap here because all of these

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:26,110
patents would have a sister patent in

00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,570
the US system so if you were going to

00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,449
take out a patent in Australia you would

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,220
probably also take out the the same

00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:35,050
patent in the u.s. system so there's

00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,900
some overlap there which means that the

00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:42,159
numbers are but not quite as depressing

00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:44,530
as you might think at first glance some

00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:47,070
other things we know that trolls are

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:50,530
bringing about eleven percent of the

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:53,349
suits in the UK on on software patents

00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,979
so it's a it's pretty hard to get data

00:05:53,349 --> 00:05:58,510
on what's happening in Europe because

00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:00,430
for a long time they've been thinking

00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:02,080
like oh we don't really have a problem

00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,330
here and we don't really have to pay any

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,400
attention to this and so there's very

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,889
little data on software patent

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:14,590
litigation and trolling activity in

00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:17,199
Europe ah but it is happening and uh we

00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:20,770
think that another thing that's going on

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,620
in Europe and in the UK is that because

00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,210
trolls got such bad publicity here in

00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,849
the US that when they went over to the

00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:29,770
UK they decided to really kind of stick

00:06:27,849 --> 00:06:31,750
with more of the lowball kind of like we

00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:33,760
send you the letter and then no one ever

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,560
speaks of it again after you settle and

00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,910
send us a check

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,740
so so we suspect that they've gone more

00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,570
that kind of activity as opposed to the

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,460
outright like giant like two giant

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:47,910
corporations battle each other out in

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:51,780
the courts another thing we know is that

00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,810
um there are a bunch of patents that

00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,230
were owned by microsoft after they

00:06:54,810 --> 00:07:03,389
acquired nokia that were then sold to an

00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:06,150
entity called conversent which monetizes

00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,669
patents and they have an office in

00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,919
Luxembourg which I is explained to me is

00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:12,360
sort of like the Delaware of Europe

00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,610
where it's really easy to incorporate

00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,139
there and you don't get a lot of like

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:20,370
prickly questions about what you're

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:24,150
doing this same entity conversent has an

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,620
office in East Texas an Ottawa I know

00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:27,470
what's going on in East Texas but I

00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,780
don't know what's going on in Ottawa or

00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:33,780
really most of Canada to be fair but um

00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:37,410
but these are these are probably mobile

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:39,510
patents and a microsoft sold them for a

00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:41,400
hundred dollars a pop to conversent as

00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:44,100
long as they get a cut of the

00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,539
monetization efforts so again we think

00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,100
these are mostly happening below the

00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:48,780
surface like letters where they go out

00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,190
to someone and then we never speak of it

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,900
again because it's been settled and

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,729
that's a condition of settling which is

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,440
common so I wish I could tell you more

00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:00,090
but without like kind of hiring private

00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,090
investigators that's kind of what I've

00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,970
got on that the other thing that we know

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:07,710
is that although foreign inventors like

00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,090
all of those patents that are issued to

00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:11,700
foreign adventures in the u.s. they do

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,639
sometimes litigate on them not as often

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:17,460
as US patent owners but when they do

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,010
they tend to be more successful than US

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:23,550
patent owners we don't know why that is

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:27,450
I have some suspicions it might be the

00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:29,310
accent or something but it's for

00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:33,599
whatever reason we know that they're

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:35,789
more successful and so the last thing

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,729
that I will say is that even if we

00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,349
figure out how to win more of the cases

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:41,969
where you get sued for patent

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:44,880
infringement as opposed to losing them

00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,709
it still sucks to get sued because it

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,030
costs a lot of money it takes a lot of

00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:50,220
attention away from

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,710
your primary business which is not being

00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,150
a patent defendant and pretty much

00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:57,030
anything else that you might want to

00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:59,510
spend your time on alphabetically

00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:04,410
arranging dirt in your yard I don't know

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:07,860
so getting sued sucks and the u.s. is

00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,740
working really hard to export its ideas

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:13,890
about so-called intellectual property

00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,300
law I don't know people have been

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:19,590
following the trans-pacific partnership

00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,660
agreement yeah okay I've been following

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,150
in mostly with an eye to the the

00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,000
copyright and patent provisions and it

00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:30,630
seeks to actually go beyond what is the

00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,750
current state here in the US so it would

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:36,780
be like 120 years after the life of the

00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,160
inventor for copyright and then carrying

00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:41,780
the idea of what the scope of

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,730
patentability should be back out past

00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:47,070
what many countries in the world besides

00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,110
the US have so you know all the patents

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,960
on software all the patents on business

00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:53,310
methods etc etc I know we could get

00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:56,520
really angry maybe we should do that

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:59,460
over beer later and then and then we can

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:02,580
I don't know call a boner or something

00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:06,780
but um the trans-pacific partnership

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:09,120
agreement uh threatens to blow away any

00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,440
of the sum of the winds that I'm going

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,880
to talk about I don't always get to talk

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:16,740
about wins when I talk about this issue

00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,680
but so this where this is right now got

00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,090
turned down by the house although the

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,730
they're expecting it to come to a vote

00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:25,170
again so so I don't know maybe maybe I

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:29,400
will eventually get to say this one is

00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:32,580
win I have no idea so so that's kind of

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,350
the big global picture aggregate numbers

00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:36,240
that type of thing I'm going to now

00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:37,290
drill down a little bit more into like

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,430
what's happening with the specific

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,590
players so when you undergo an activity

00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:45,360
for so long like some people become

00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:47,580
expert at it and they figure out how to

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,970
game the system a little bit better and

00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:53,100
we're going to look at that next uh we

00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,860
now know that sixty-five percent of the

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,350
litigated non-practicing entity suits

00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,110
are software related claims so when we

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,800
talk about trolls in general two-thirds

00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,450
of the time

00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,930
are talking about software patent suits

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:10,080
or software related claims and so that

00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:12,240
means that trolls have figured out that

00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,300
their very favorite type of case to

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,670
bring is a software patent case and

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:19,170
that's they have gone to great lengths

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:23,100
to figure out how to bring more of them

00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,100
so we also know a couple other things we

00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,510
know about trolls is that they tend to

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:31,290
reuse the same patents over and over

00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:32,339
again we know that the newest patents

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,010
are the ones that are the most

00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:38,399
frequently litigated either newest to

00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:40,769
their collection or newest from the US

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,380
Patent Office so so the massive

00:11:40,769 --> 00:11:44,910
aggregators will sue on a patent that

00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:47,390
they've just purchased or just been

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:51,810
granted sometimes within a week of

00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:54,750
receiving it so the other thing that we

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,700
know is that because npes keep using the

00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:59,040
same patents over and over again the

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:02,940
average age of a litigated patent from a

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,769
troll is slightly older and then lastly

00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,390
the other thing that's kind of

00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:08,640
disturbing that we know about trolls is

00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:12,529
that forty percent of the time they are

00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:17,220
suing users and not makers of software

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:20,250
so that's that mean that means that they

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,050
are making your customers pay and your

00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:24,930
users pay or people that you offered

00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:27,120
software to for free pay because and

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,820
they don't they feel even less qualified

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,700
than you might as a software creator to

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,560
figure out what is being sued on in the

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,020
letter so they get the letter and

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,800
they're like I actually don't understand

00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:44,880
most of these words except for patent

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:48,480
and infringement so perhaps we should

00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:57,260
pay and that's what they're banking on

00:12:48,480 --> 00:13:00,269
literally banking on so um so trolls as

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:02,279
large and ugly of a threat as they are

00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:04,920
to free and open source software aren't

00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,709
even the entire story we've been seeing

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,810
the line between practicing entity and

00:13:07,709 --> 00:13:15,170
non-practicing entity get blurrier and

00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:17,660
blurrier i talked about the microsoft

00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,579
you know buddy conversent that is

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,399
monetizing patents on their behalf for

00:13:19,579 --> 00:13:24,279
cut they're not the only company that's

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,560
doing that there are other companies

00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:30,230
where they had a business area that they

00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,120
never pursued and but they took out

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,250
patents and then are bringing patents

00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:37,070
they're sort of like a troll arm on a

00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:40,040
practicing entity and then we've also

00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:43,010
got schools that have out having own

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:45,740
patents and are working with an entity

00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:47,779
to protect their the patents that the

00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,579
school is producing so the the line

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,139
between what is a practicing entity and

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:54,380
what's a non-practicing entity is

00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:56,269
starting to become very fuzzy sorry i

00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:03,800
I'm not used to having a thing stuck to

00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:06,740
my face so so all that said um let's

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,910
look at where lawyers come in do you

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,480
guys know what contingent fee

00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:16,339
representation is yeah it's a fancy word

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,110
for ambulance-chasing which if someone

00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:20,000
did really do you're wrong and you don't

00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,980
have money to sue them but that's the

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,890
point of contingent fee legislation and

00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:27,680
our society is that if you're poor and

00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,839
someone screws you over you can still

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,449
get legal representation as long as you

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,370
give them a cut of whatever comes out

00:14:31,449 --> 00:14:37,370
sometimes that's justified sometimes

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,680
maybe whatever uh but again that's not

00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:42,529
that's not like really my area but we're

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:45,370
starting to see it happen in software

00:14:42,529 --> 00:14:49,250
patent litigation which is my area so

00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,769
this means lawyers are going to patent

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:56,540
owners and saying like oh you look like

00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:58,579
a person that could use more money and I

00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,040
don't know how many people would be like

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,620
no no no you're totally mistaken I have

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,300
way too much money already anyone in

00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:08,630
here I'll come and talk to you later

00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:12,500
okay uh that was no one just for the

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:14,149
record okay so uh and they're they're

00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,279
sort of gaming it the same way that

00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:20,089
venture capitalists with so this is a

00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:22,639
quote an anonymous quote from one of the

00:15:20,089 --> 00:15:24,470
one of the big firms that is bringing a

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,470
lot of these contingent fee legislation

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:28,250
I mean litigation cases on top or

00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,770
patents

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,330
saying even with a 40-percent contingent

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:34,430
shares so that means they're going and

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:36,770
saying you've got a patent will bring a

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:40,220
suit on it you'll get sixty percent and

00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:43,490
will take 40 but we need five million in

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,950
damages to break even per case and so

00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:48,080
they figured out that if they use a

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:50,870
venture capitalist model they fund 10

00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:53,030
cases to win one which means the one

00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:57,980
they win they're hoping to get 50

00:15:53,030 --> 00:16:00,650
million on and not because the patent or

00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,330
the technology or whatever it is is

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,770
worth 50 million you'll notice that

00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,370
didn't really end up in the spreadsheet

00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:09,350
at all here it's what they need to pay

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,630
for all of the other suits that they're

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,400
bothering people with so they can make a

00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:15,860
large enough percentage even after

00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,750
paying the patent owner sixty percent to

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:22,850
have lawyers around the clock working to

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:25,180
bring suits yes ah the other thing so

00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,520
that's the large like that's kind of

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,980
lawyers coming out like kind of a tiered

00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:33,140
system those are the largest firms like

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,060
really big ones that are looking for the

00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:37,430
50 million-dollar payout but there are

00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:41,030
small and mid firms that are having

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:42,650
problems where they uh they want to be

00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:45,200
able to hire more lawyers but they don't

00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:47,360
have money so they say like okay you

00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:49,040
know we'll we'll get some of these young

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,470
folks out of school and we'll have them

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:53,450
work on contingent fee like over the

00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:56,839
less fancy end of the office or whatever

00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,580
and this they've got plenty of lawyers

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,370
to choose from because all during the

00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:04,189
90s and early aughts law schools were

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,470
telling students you know like a law

00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:09,170
school degree is basically a ticket to

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:11,959
like wealth and luxury and and fancy

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,069
cars and awesomeness and you know is

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:15,709
because we're undergrads they're like

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,360
yeah alright cool and and even when are

00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:19,870
like alright well show me the numbers

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,610
law schools very famously sort of

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,459
misrepresented the placement of lawyers

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:28,280
post law school by saying how many of

00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:30,500
their grads were working but not

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:35,870
actually describing how many of them

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:37,880
were working as lawyers so a lot of

00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:39,350
folks came out of law school and found

00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,330
that there were actually no more law

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,299
jobs left

00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:45,220
so some of the firm's decide to sort of

00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:48,399
stopped up this excess by lighting the

00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:50,470
work on contingent fee so that's kind of

00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:52,480
the the mid-sized there where they're

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,210
like okay well you know if you can if

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,309
you can find a case that we you know if

00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,690
you can find a case for a client we

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:00,909
don't yet have which means you have to

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,010
go find the client then you can bring

00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:04,860
that suit and and you can your your

00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:08,590
office can have whatever that brings in

00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:11,110
so so at that mid-level you've got a

00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:15,850
larger firms with like a contingent fee

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:18,669
a patent monetization area and then at

00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:21,970
the at the very bottom level some of the

00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:24,220
smaller firms are just you know they're

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:25,720
they're just doing this to kind of

00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,940
supplement their other income and

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,679
they'll go after a weaker defendant

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,529
first and there's three reasons they do

00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:36,010
that one is to get a little money in the

00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:38,710
war chest two is to make the patent look

00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:40,179
more robust like by saying oh well you

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:41,799
know all these other companies rolled

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:43,720
over on it and they didn't find a new

00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,299
prior art so what do you think you're

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:48,519
going to find when we see you and then

00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:52,929
also sometimes to establish a venue like

00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:54,880
say East Texas so they do that uh and

00:18:52,929 --> 00:18:56,830
then some of the other firms they're not

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,600
even looking for big payouts they're

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,480
just going for quantity over quality

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:06,669
just sending tons and tons and tons of

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:08,200
letters so this you know produces lots

00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:10,750
and lots of small money which of course

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,700
adds up and then they can go and find

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,250
another patent so even when they do get

00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,450
challenged they throw that one out and

00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:18,850
then they'll come back they're like oh

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,429
well we actually had like 16 patents in

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,019
that area so like you know can you just

00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:24,250
go do a little find and replace and

00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:28,779
we'll just send the letters out with a

00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:32,440
new patent number I imagine I don't work

00:19:28,779 --> 00:19:34,330
for one of these places but for this

00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,860
year volume of letters I can't imagine

00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:39,970
they're spending any more time on it

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:44,049
than that so so that's that's lawyers

00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:45,940
and and others I'm going to talk about

00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:50,190
judges and juries next which is actually

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,190
less gross than the lawyer part

00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:57,280
um so judges and juries yeah this is

00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,280
actually this is the bit of good news

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,580
that I can sit here so in the 1990s

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:06,220
defendants in a patent litigation suit

00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:08,890
needed to either find prior art or prove

00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,740
that the work was out of scope in the

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:15,940
90s the courts were extremely reluctant

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:18,610
to say I don't know what they're up to

00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,090
it the US Patent Office this had really

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:24,760
never have been granted the courts is

00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:26,680
some kind of fellow feeling government

00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,510
functionary to government functionary

00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,920
where they just didn't want to say that

00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:33,880
they thought the US Patent Office was

00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,870
wrong so in the 90s if you were sued for

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,490
patent infringement your best course of

00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:42,160
winning the case was to either find

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:43,960
something that was like whoops it looks

00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,780
like you missed this thing that someone

00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:48,910
else invented a year or two before and

00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:52,780
there was actually prior art that like

00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:56,020
you somehow missed oops or to say like

00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:58,240
oh well the person bringing the suit

00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:00,190
doesn't really understand our work that

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,110
well like they're doing this thing and

00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,180
we're doing this slightly different

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,730
thing which isn't infringing and the

00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,980
courts would tap you know that would be

00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:11,800
the best way to win a suit if you were a

00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:15,730
defendant in a patent litigation suit so

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:18,400
that's changed a lot actually the

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,050
numbers and I hope they update these one

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,940
day because I would love to see how this

00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:25,300
is how what's happened to this post

00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:29,260
bilski post America Invents Act but even

00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:32,800
by 2008 and 2009 the court started to be

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:35,020
like I don't really know what they're up

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:37,930
to it the US patent and trade office

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:41,320
because this is this should never have

00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:42,670
been granted and that's what that that's

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,010
what it means when you say non

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,690
patentable subject matter this is

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:49,960
fifty-four percent of the suits that

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,630
defendants are winning as of 2008 and

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,730
two thousand of nine are you know the

00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:56,710
court saying this is not a patent that

00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:01,530
should have ever been granted I don't

00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,530
know what they were thinking yeah

00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:11,290
yeah yeah although as you saw we have a

00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:13,420
good healthy supply of patents so it'll

00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:17,050
take a while to it'll take a while to

00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:18,670
get them all out that way um so uh so

00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:22,540
this is this isn't the lower court level

00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:24,640
and then we saw this idea kind of

00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,820
finally bubbled up at the Supreme Court

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:31,120
level so the Alice vs. CLS bank rolling

00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:34,000
in 2014 this is the you can't do the on

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,210
a computer anymore so this is saying

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,040
that generic computer implementation is

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:41,650
non patentable subject matter the

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,810
Supreme Court says that means that if

00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:45,250
you get sued by someone and you think

00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,690
that their patent is not patentable

00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:48,670
subject matter and you have a little

00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:53,470
money to go to court that you may

00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:55,950
actually win so that's good right um and

00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:58,360
in fact we saw it almost immediately

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,370
confirmed at the federal circuit level

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,160
this is just this is less than six

00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:06,640
months later the Federal Circuit

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,010
digitech imaging versus a electronics

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:14,350
for imaging and their case was basically

00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:17,490
uh if you have a file that can be turned

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:21,910
into an image we have the patent on that

00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:23,500
that was that was the case uh for folks

00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,060
it or not versed in the way that the

00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,610
courts like to word things this is a

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:29,950
giant fruit basket and like a dozen red

00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:31,780
roses like thank you so much i can

00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:35,080
finally throw this garbage out of my

00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,730
court and so in in their in their

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,280
opinion they've said like yes

00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,560
fundamental constants by themselves not

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,330
patentable subject matter like go home

00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,090
and do not let the door hit you on the

00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:49,870
butt on the way out so we've actually

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:51,730
started to see this reconfirmed also at

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:54,250
the lower court level the particular

00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:57,400
this particular document doctrine the on

00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:59,920
a computer so this year no major cases

00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:01,630
just small local ones some of the things

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,660
that I thought were fun that got tossed

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:07,360
out at the lower court level were

00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:11,850
picture menus to choose food on a

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:16,570
computer a court was able to say no

00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:17,309
upselling on a computer also know and in

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,110
the

00:24:17,309 --> 00:24:21,269
vision there actually says like uh this

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:25,919
one's probably about as old as Commerce

00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:28,950
itself so no and bingo playing on a

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,070
computer is also no longer patentable by

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:36,600
virtue of being on a computer so you

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:38,730
guys can go to grubhub upsell play bingo

00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:42,990
and not worry about patent infringement

00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:49,080
anymore a more or less again I'm not a

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:51,960
lawyer but the other doctrine that that

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,720
we've started to see percolate up is a

00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,840
what a what lawyers call indefiniteness

00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:02,129
and this is when a patent has been

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:04,019
worded so confusingly that nobody no

00:25:02,129 --> 00:25:05,909
person who is skilled in the art could

00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:08,240
replicate the invention because they

00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:11,519
don't know what you're talking about

00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:13,379
it's it it is it once you once you kind

00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,139
of take the legalese off some of these

00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:19,590
things it really it's kind of like some

00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:23,940
sort of sadistic cartoon almost the

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:26,249
Supreme Court also used this in 2014 the

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:28,710
Nautilus versus biosig ruling big

00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:33,539
patents aren't enforceable that's the

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:38,159
TLDR this case was to exercise machines

00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:40,649
and because the the patent holder didn't

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,440
want to say handshape things hand hand

00:25:40,649 --> 00:25:45,240
width apart on like a exercise machine

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,129
you know in the place where you put your

00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,320
hands like they didn't want to say that

00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:54,899
that's what they were doing they said

00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:57,600
mounted in a spaced relationship and the

00:25:54,899 --> 00:26:00,299
courser like you mean hand size like

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,019
hand width apart like no you can't have

00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:05,970
a patent on that and so I haven't seen

00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:08,639
too much from lower courts on this but

00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:11,940
will probably also see this doctor and

00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:14,700
taken up and used as well although Vegas

00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,139
may be more difficult to it's not quite

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,639
as low-hanging fruit because it means

00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:21,840
you have to actually try to read these

00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:23,610
terrible patents to overturn them so so

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,820
that's that's the good news that the

00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,500
courts in the US have embraced the we

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:30,730
don't know what they're up to it the

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,650
USPTO but we're not going to

00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,690
to just accept everything that they send

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:39,130
us and rubber stamp it in our courtroom

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:42,910
so that's great right there's also been

00:26:39,130 --> 00:26:45,730
a conversation amongst judges kind of

00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:48,730
looking at the idea of like who hears

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,710
patent suits and does that make the

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:54,220
judges who hear patent suits all the

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:57,220
time uniquely qualified as a specialized

00:26:54,220 --> 00:27:00,070
sort of court or does it produce some i

00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:02,890
love the very nice way of saying this

00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:06,610
tunnel vision where they've maybe last a

00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:10,150
bit of perspective on on the subject

00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:12,040
matter and so uh one piece of the rare

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,740
convince dad said like well will allow

00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:18,820
other judges to occasionally hear patent

00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:20,830
suits just to see what happens uh and

00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,230
and they did and it was it's not tons

00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:26,500
but they did already find some fairly

00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:28,480
interesting data what they found was

00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,419
basically that more experience with

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,270
patent suits makes a judge less likely

00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:38,380
to rule for patent holders I imagine

00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:40,330
even just 12 verses a second suit so I

00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:44,200
imagine it goes like something like this

00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:46,900
where a judge comes into work and uh oh

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,820
my gosh the person who invented the

00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,880
internet is bringing a suit in their

00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:53,559
court like how exciting they've met the

00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,140
person who invented the internet and

00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,970
they you know lots of legalese and like

00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,549
the judges like yeah that's I mean the

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,490
Internet's important so yeah yeah okay

00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:05,440
and then then a few months go by and the

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:07,750
person who invented the internet is

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,540
another person now and they're back in

00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,640
their court and they're like wait a

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:16,360
second I have heard all these confusing

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,730
technical words before and you can't all

00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,000
have an event to the internet so no so

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:24,190
that even the second case and the love

00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,410
the the the academic paper that this

00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:29,860
comes from is does familiarity breeds

00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:33,130
contempt amongst judges deciding patent

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,780
cases and I think the answer is yes and

00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:38,429
then we have finally found someone we

00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:40,840
like when they're angry which is is good

00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:42,309
and they're not the only ones we found

00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,120
some other folks that we like when they

00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:46,600
get angry

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:50,890
in New York the Attorney General Eric

00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:54,600
Schneiderman had a had to deal with a

00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:57,580
notorious troll mphj which was um

00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,550
pestering folks businesses all over New

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,250
York State with a scanner patents and

00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:05,410
these are living it was like copiers fax

00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:07,900
machines like so they were going after

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,700
people who were using copiers or fax

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:12,190
machines or had any kind of digital

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:14,320
imaging sort of component in their

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:16,480
office and saying they needed to pay

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,900
them a thousand or some number of

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:24,190
dollars per user and the new york AG

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:26,530
said no not only that like i'm suing you

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:31,350
for fraud and i want you to pay back all

00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:36,130
the money so that's pretty awesome

00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:40,800
vermont also decided like ya know the

00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:43,570
same the same troll mphj was suing uh

00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,390
everyone who had a scanner or copier in

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:48,010
their state as well and went after a

00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:50,800
nonprofit that helps people with

00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:52,210
disabilities find jobs so people are

00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:55,330
coming in and making copies of the

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,610
resume on the copier and they wanted a

00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,679
thousand dollars per user of the copier

00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:02,440
from a nonprofit that helps people with

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,340
disabilities find work and Vermont said

00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,410
yeah okay as long as you are kind of you

00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,360
know like you can't see people with

00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:12,700
disabilities here like when I was you've

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,820
now stepped over from like questionable

00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:18,429
to evil and we're not down with that and

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,500
so that was so they're being sued for

00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:23,740
violating the Vermont Consumer

00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:26,950
Protection Act so so we are starting to

00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:29,800
see some backlash against egregious

00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,929
litigation and vague patents and trolls

00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,720
and that type of thing so that's uh

00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:37,300
that's all good so judges attorney

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,070
general's like yeah we've gotten them up

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:45,550
to speed and they they know what's going

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:47,320
on not so with juries um so I mentioned

00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:49,420
these Texas before it's sort of this

00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,320
notorious district where patent trolls

00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:56,500
like to bring their suits right it's a

00:30:53,320 --> 00:31:00,430
it's jury its jurors are special

00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,440
it's a it's their farmers they don't

00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,390
they don't use a lot of technology uh

00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,700
and there's maybe not all that much

00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:08,710
going on in Marshall Texas like where

00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,150
you get paid for a free lunch and get to

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,050
hang out and meet people i don't i don't

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:17,890
know um and so uh the jurors in east

00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:22,810
texas are very a patent litigation

00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:24,850
friendly in some way this is this is

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,340
actually so well known i don't know how

00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:30,420
many of you guys watch John Oliver but

00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:33,400
he did a segment on on patent trolls and

00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:36,730
went to the Marshall Texas courthouse

00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:39,220
and there's a huge ice skating rink that

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:42,010
it was paid for by Samsung in front of

00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:44,080
the Marshall Texas courthouse like it's

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:48,910
got samsung plastered on it and giant

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,740
like huge letters and I mean I I don't

00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:53,170
know how many people are doing that much

00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:57,610
ice skating in Marshall Texas that uh

00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:59,670
that's you they're definitely they're

00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:03,280
definitely trying to buy some

00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:07,360
fellow-feeling goodwill etc on the way

00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:10,450
into the courthouse there so uh so like

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,580
I said juries are not the same as judges

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,950
judges tend to rule for the patentee

00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:18,730
only about half the time even Texas

00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:21,090
judges actually where's jurors rule for

00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:25,960
the patentee over two-thirds of the time

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:29,140
so if you as a patent litigant go before

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,420
the court you are always going to ask if

00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:34,150
you can have your case heard by a jury

00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:37,450
that's just what the plaintiff does they

00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:39,130
always always do it and because the jury

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:41,620
the jury is just going to be more

00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:43,990
favorable to them so now we're in a

00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:47,260
situation where over seventy percent of

00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,930
patent cases are heard by juries that's

00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,760
a huge change from like 30 or 40 years

00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:56,680
ago where that number was about five

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:59,320
percent so the courts in many ways

00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:00,970
obvious and less obvious favors the

00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,680
frequent litigator if you're in there

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:05,950
every week you know what the judge likes

00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:08,970
to hear you know how to get a jury case

00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,360
instead of a judge case you know

00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:12,730
poliwhirl

00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:14,980
these are buried and probably were to

00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:17,920
rent ice skates which is weird too but

00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:20,170
uh anyway the courts favorite a frequent

00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:25,360
litigator it's it's it's it's not about

00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:26,650
merit it's about money so uh I said I'm

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,420
sorry I said this was going to be the

00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:32,830
good news part uh but alright so some

00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,770
things are working some things are

00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:38,260
working in countries outside the US

00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:41,260
we've seen a Germany New Zealand and

00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:44,140
India have put really strict limits on

00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:46,330
patentability that so they will still

00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,740
have some largely hardware but with a

00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,780
little bit software component patent

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,330
maybe they're they're not perfect pieces

00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:55,660
of legislation but some of the more

00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:58,060
egregious like you know bingo comma on a

00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:00,640
computer like they're not having it here

00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,800
in Germany or New Zealand or India so

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:08,050
that's exciting I mean sometimes a

00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:12,340
democracy works ray one of the reasons

00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:14,470
that I was going to say with a caveat

00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:17,110
that it works better in a smaller place

00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:20,140
than a larger place so for New Zealand

00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:22,330
in particular um you might think like Oh

00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,980
New Zealand like maybe they could pass

00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:26,070
something similar in Australia and I've

00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,870
talked to folks in both and they're like

00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:31,510
New Zealand sort of this like hippie

00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:33,550
surfer wonderland with like really small

00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:35,680
districts and we have really good access

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:38,410
to our politicians and so we're able to

00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:41,040
get things going like yeah let's just

00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:44,710
not have patents on software anymore

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,320
Australia not so much and probably more

00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:51,520
analogous to the US although we haven't

00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:55,930
seen state level changes that are good

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,640
we won't see uh we won't be able to

00:34:55,930 --> 00:35:00,130
remove software from the scope of

00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:01,810
patentability state-by-state that's not

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,750
that's not a state issue its federal

00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:08,290
issue but you can pass legislation

00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:10,960
saying that if you are going to bring

00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:13,720
patent legislation you have to disclose

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,310
the real party in interest like not just

00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,620
give me the shell corporation that

00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,660
you're pretending to be today but tell

00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:22,930
me who's actually financially benefiting

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,880
from this piece of you know this lawsuit

00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:28,869
you have to actually say the patents

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:32,200
that you're suing on in all of the blank

00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:34,599
states that's not the case and you have

00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,460
to say what thing it is you think that

00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:40,480
the defendant is doing that is

00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:43,960
infringing on your patent so those are

00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,460
helpful uh and and probably the best

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,040
progress we could hope for at the state

00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:51,970
level so these and these are ongoing

00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,359
different places you'll notice that

00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:57,910
Texas has not signed in not that I'm you

00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,030
know we haven't done anything in

00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:02,170
Massachusetts where I live either and

00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:04,599
California certainly has some interest

00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:08,589
in may be curving frivolous patent suits

00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,059
but has also not done anything so they

00:36:08,589 --> 00:36:20,440
might be too big were you going to say

00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:22,329
something oh so do software patents aged

00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,990
out like medicine patents yes they do

00:36:22,329 --> 00:36:31,270
and in fact their actual patents have a

00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:33,640
term of 20 years so there is a UH there

00:36:31,270 --> 00:36:35,799
is an academic conversation happening as

00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:39,460
to whether we should d couple the

00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:42,460
different areas of patents because uh I

00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:45,670
mean to be honest taking on big pharma

00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:48,309
and like a big tech at the same time as

00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:50,140
sort of I know it's like picking a fight

00:36:48,309 --> 00:36:55,720
with a tiger when you're being mauled by

00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:57,880
a bear already so uh it's so decoupling

00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,520
the term length for patents like could

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,470
be advantageous but I think most

00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,150
politicians are afraid to do that

00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,599
because it would sort of open a whole

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:10,720
can of worms and I've I spoke to someone

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,460
who was like who thought that in fact

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:14,799
they thought that Pharma might use that

00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:17,650
as a wedge to increase the term for

00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:19,900
pharmaceutical patents and and like

00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:21,579
please don't d couple all the things

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,750
because that would be really terrible

00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:27,880
for them yeah exactly unintended

00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:31,329
consequences and I don't know if that's

00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,549
a case like it's a but we'd certainly

00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,619
need some fine grained understanding of

00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:36,400
the patent system in Congress before we

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:53,289
could consider

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:56,020
such thing right so on on top of those

00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:59,410
amazing out like yeah the term is very

00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:01,390
long 20 years is very long and and also

00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,180
vague vague patents don't really help

00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:06,160
anyone because there are there are

00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:08,829
numerous examples of people using a

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,240
really old patent I think there was one

00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:17,260
that was intended for a music on a

00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:20,170
server being deployed to like a consumer

00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,849
point and what they had meant was these

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,950
things in the 80s where you would go to

00:38:21,849 --> 00:38:25,720
a kiosk and you would punch up some

00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:29,020
songs and it would make a mixtape for

00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,359
you immediately but some someone bought

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:36,369
it and decided to try I think they tried

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:38,260
to sue iTunes uh which I don't remember

00:38:36,369 --> 00:38:41,799
how that one turned out I just the the

00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:45,730
the ridiculousness of using the mixtape

00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:48,579
kiosk patent to sue iTunes is so

00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:51,010
hilarious in in like the worst way

00:38:48,579 --> 00:38:53,170
possible but there are tons of those

00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,329
there's like other ones where you know

00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:58,420
communicating remotely and then they've

00:38:55,329 --> 00:39:02,770
gone after people with a podcast and so

00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:04,569
yeah you if it points out two important

00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:06,460
flaws with the patent system for

00:39:04,569 --> 00:39:09,789
software in that yes the term is very

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:13,410
long and then to that a broad vaguely

00:39:09,789 --> 00:39:15,970
worded patents can be misused and

00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:19,359
appropriated for a technology they

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:21,460
weren't intended for I'm gonna just have

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,369
a couple more slides and we can we can

00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:25,960
open it up for questions and stuff some

00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:28,599
of the other things that were good the

00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,559
America Invents Act said no more joinder

00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:35,380
so previously a patent litigants had to

00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:38,140
send they could send one letter to like

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,329
50 different defendants and sue them all

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,740
under the same patent at once this is

00:39:40,329 --> 00:39:43,510
one of the reasons that they were able

00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:47,289
to make a case for East Texas because

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:49,760
they're in the middle so we can all meet

00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:53,180
there instead of anywhere that

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,730
want to go or where your business is

00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:58,070
located and it adds it adds cost for

00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:00,890
your California defendants it adds cost

00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,480
for East Coast defendants and just makes

00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:04,630
it more annoying and more likely that

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,610
they'll want to settle in addition to

00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:10,190
having this very favorable district when

00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:12,170
they do get there this didn't this had

00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:14,510
like some limited effectiveness you can

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,450
see when the America Invents Act came

00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:20,300
into effect there's a little dip on the

00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:22,250
number of parties involved in

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,500
non-practicing entity lawsuits and then

00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,620
it starts to go back up again so they

00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:30,140
figured out how to send separate letters

00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:33,190
I work at the open invention Network

00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,930
which is a mutual non-aggression pact we

00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:37,670
work just for the community for your

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:40,580
knee open source software so like Linux

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:43,190
can you android a lot of the development

00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:45,860
tools and things that would come with a

00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,740
new linux distribution or on a mobile

00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:51,710
device is covered under the mutual

00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:53,840
non-aggression pact so basically we ask

00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:56,360
everyone to sign something saying like I

00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:59,210
promise not to sue it anyone else who

00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,100
signed this thing we have about 1200

00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:02,690
flask companies and projects that have

00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,170
agreed to not see each other which is

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:08,120
great they also offer free cross-license

00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:10,790
to all their patents to each other so

00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:12,560
that if you get sued from outside the

00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,190
pool you have something to countersue

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:19,430
with again with the caveat that suing is

00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:20,960
expensive countersuing is expensive we

00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,650
do also coordinate some defensive

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:27,590
publishing around key stuff around you

00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:31,340
know linux android canoe that we think

00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:34,850
is particularly juicy looking litigation

00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:37,490
areas so so that's another thing that we

00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:39,020
do so your homework if you've decided

00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:44,210
that you would like to do something

00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:47,450
about this patent busting uh this is

00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,130
great you do not have to be a lawyer you

00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:53,000
just have to understand the technology I

00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,040
saw one come up on I think it was the on

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,920
our site the Linux defenders org where

00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,940
it was a Microsoft just a couple years

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,810
ago was trying to get a patent for the

00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:06,080
amazing invention

00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:08,000
by which alerts you to having forgotten

00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:09,650
to put an attachment on your email so

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,780
you know like when you read an email and

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,340
you're right it's attached and then you

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,870
actually forget to attach it because you

00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:17,030
were doing something and you're not your

00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:19,010
coffee / or whatever and then you get a

00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:21,020
little box it says like oops it looks

00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:24,740
like you forgot to attach your file and

00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:29,590
so just like two years ago Microsoft had

00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:31,730
filed a patent for that invention I

00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,410
assume everyone here has been emailing

00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:37,250
for more than two years and has seen

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:40,550
that little box right yeah yeah so

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:42,410
though so if you if you pay even a

00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:44,960
little attention to technology you can

00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:46,760
participate in patent busting maybe you

00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,540
have a screenshot from three years ago

00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,780
you could you could help pass laws if

00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:55,700
you can in your state like the one I

00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:59,270
talked about disclosing the real party

00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:01,760
in interest asking the the patent

00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:03,680
litigant expressly say what patent

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,690
they're suing on and what activity they

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,390
think the defendant is engaging in that

00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:11,450
infringes on their patents with the

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:14,630
recognition that passing laws is sort of

00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:16,370
like making sausage but maybe maybe you

00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:20,080
can ask some friends from a neighboring

00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:23,000
state to help you navigate that process

00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:25,580
lastly I keep talking to your neighbors

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,350
and colleagues most people heard the NPR

00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,840
student are like oh rolls that sound so

00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,820
terrible or they hear about like Samsung

00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,550
or Google or Apple and they don't really

00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:36,740
understand that you know nonprofits that

00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:39,020
are being sued and like small businesses

00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:41,360
and individuals and like tiny software

00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:45,470
projects are also being sued because I

00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:47,180
know that uh occasionally when I talk to

00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:50,150
people about patent litigation they're

00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:51,500
like I honestly don't care if Samsung

00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,890
and Google's to each other out of

00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:56,600
existence like I have the tiniest violin

00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:57,800
for like the millions of dollars going

00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:02,090
back and forth between those two

00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,390
companies like yeah no I i understand

00:44:02,090 --> 00:44:06,470
that okay but you know it's a but

00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,850
talking to your neighbors and colleagues

00:44:06,470 --> 00:44:09,800
and letting them know that that's not

00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:12,380
the only place that this is happening

00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,580
and and if you want you can also tell

00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,340
them that's making their phone more

00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:18,390
expensive

00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:21,250
so if you really need to bring it home

00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:23,740
if you enjoy reading about this stuff

00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,450
like maybe you feel too optimistic and

00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,350
sunny about the world sometimes and you

00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:30,910
like to read stuff that will fix that

00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:32,500
there's uh there's lots of sand I have

00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:35,050
more of these I've read like like

00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:37,570
probably like more than hundred of these

00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,580
by now but this one is the one that's

00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,560
the only place where I was able to find

00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:44,800
some information on Europe and

00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:47,590
non-practicing entities the one about

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:49,000
the patent term reduction the gentleman

00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:52,590
in the yellow you in particular may

00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,270
enjoy this one from talking about how

00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:57,280
patent term reduction might fix the

00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:59,550
troll problem it might it might not I'm

00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,440
he leaves it a little bit inconclusive

00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:05,230
the contingent fee representation in

00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,640
patent litigation if you want basically

00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:09,880
a lot of anonymous quotes from

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,310
sociopaths that that's that's got you

00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:14,170
hooked up and then dis familiarity

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:15,730
breeds contempt among judges deciding

00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,580
patent cases I already told you the

00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:21,160
answer is yes but the the tone of this

00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:22,840
one is pretty entertaining and and then

00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,490
understanding the realities of modern

00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,930
patent litigation so if you enjoyed the

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,060
part where I talked about the different

00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:29,950
doctrines like where the courts went

00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,680
from not wanting to throw the USPTO

00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:34,720
under the bus to being like if no idea

00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,240
what you guys are up to over there but

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,770
it's it's not i'm not having in my

00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,800
courtroom so there's that and then

00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:43,090
there's a lot of data at land store too

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,780
and of course have pictures and font

00:45:43,090 --> 00:45:54,010
credits and i would be willing to take

00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:55,810
your questions thanks so much all right

00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:57,280
i'm gonna go to the gray in the back

00:45:55,810 --> 00:46:10,390
because we did hear from you once

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:27,210
already prendelo okay yeah postage is

00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:27,210
cheap thousands of letters uh-huh yeah

00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:35,920
yeah so the shell companies uh that's

00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,420
actually a pretty well-known phenomenon

00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:39,250
there's another great paper that i

00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:41,140
didn't include they're called the the

00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:43,360
Giants among us which is about massive

00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,040
aggregators and tell us primarily about

00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,680
intellectual ventures but there are a

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,150
lot of other companies that thought

00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:52,270
hadn't even Merville guy has a ton of

00:46:49,150 --> 00:46:54,310
money and i want a ton of money so they

00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:56,980
have borrowed a page from that and also

00:46:54,310 --> 00:46:59,860
done the shell corporation thing uh and

00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,870
that's why those states have passed

00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:03,970
legislation saying like you must

00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,640
disclose the real party in interest you

00:47:03,970 --> 00:47:08,980
cannot hide chinned like seven layers or

00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,930
shell corporations like if you're going

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:12,910
to bring a patent suit then you have to

00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:16,090
tell us who really owns the patent and

00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:19,870
who's really going to get paid so yeah

00:47:16,090 --> 00:47:23,410
so that uh that is that is definitely a

00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:25,300
trend and and that's why the response in

00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:39,820
the form of the statewide legislation

00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:41,860
has happened uh-huh oh great yay alright

00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:46,450
so another troll that was bringing suits

00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:49,090
on a serving adult content which is you

00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:54,000
know again probably as old as commerce

00:47:49,090 --> 00:48:00,450
itself is a been served with contempt on

00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:00,450
a computer of course in the back

00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:32,410
sure yeah oh sorry so so these are

00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:34,780
statewide legislation I'm saying the

00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:47,950
current default is not to actually say

00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:52,210
what patent you're suing on yeah it runs

00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:55,300
to it have you seen um you seem like

00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:59,020
good fellows yeah so it's kind of like

00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,490
you know I've got a lot of patents sure

00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,410
would be a shame if we had to do

00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:09,010
something to this nice business of yours

00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:10,240
uh if you yeah I mean I I don't know I

00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:12,670
don't know how you would render the

00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:15,070
knuckle cracking and text but it is

00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:17,140
basically like you know we're company

00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:19,720
that has a lot of patents in in this

00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:22,660
vague area and it seems that you're

00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:26,470
infringing some of them and so like they

00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:29,320
may ask for a specific fee or they may

00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:32,290
ask them to cross-license enter into a

00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:34,720
cross-licensing agreement with them that

00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,960
they and then once they've signed

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:39,280
they'll see what the patents are maybe

00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,450
there's a lot of weird ways there's

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:46,599
actually like a great story of a Russian

00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:50,140
inventor who got a letter from a u.s.

00:49:46,599 --> 00:49:51,849
npe that like he got one letter that was

00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,200
like hey you know we've got a lot of

00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:54,580
patents it seems like they'd be really

00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,080
helpful for your business maybe you

00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,119
should enter in norcross licensing

00:49:56,080 --> 00:50:00,369
agreement and then I got a letter from a

00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:02,349
slightly different entity saying it

00:50:00,369 --> 00:50:04,720
looks like you're infringing on all of

00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:06,760
our patents in this area and then you

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,320
know need Norman both because he's in

00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,849
Russia you figured like how are you

00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:11,859
going to get me over here and then you

00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,670
got the other letter saying like hey you

00:50:11,859 --> 00:50:14,830
sure you don't wanna do a

00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:18,369
cross-licensing agreement so he

00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:20,680
contacted the US government uh I forget

00:50:18,369 --> 00:50:24,910
which agency and asked if he could bring

00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:28,540
a racketeering charge against the entity

00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:31,000
sending the letters sadly they said no

00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:34,600
it's actually completely legal to have a

00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,210
big you know a pile of shell

00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:42,070
corporations and send conflicting weird

00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:55,240
vaguely threatening letters yeah right

00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:58,990
here oh so the question is about the

00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:00,310
state legislation um it's uh it varies a

00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,440
little bit from state to state but

00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:04,840
basically it says you must explicitly

00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:07,780
say which patent you think is being

00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:10,450
infringed that you own in your letter

00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:13,350
when you in your initial letter and that

00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:15,670
you also must say what activity the

00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:19,720
defendant is engaging in that you

00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:22,990
believe in fringes your patent yeah you

00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:25,060
actually have to send letters to people

00:51:22,990 --> 00:51:28,390
whose businesses you're at least a tiny

00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:38,280
bit familiar with and um name a specific

00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:38,280
patent that you own yes so um yeah yeah

00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:41,490
yeah

00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:04,240
right so that um what you've gotten to

00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:06,250
the heart he's asking about how software

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,880
patents are different from mechanical

00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:12,550
patents and the answer is it there that

00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:15,369
it makes notice particularly hard

00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:18,250
because uh so if I invent a a pitchfork

00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:20,020
and then you invent a pitchfork like

00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,609
everyone in this room can just look at

00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:25,210
the two pitchforks and we know if it's

00:52:21,609 --> 00:52:27,880
different or not but for a software

00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:29,770
patent you say like oh I'm fixing this

00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,410
problem but you don't have to provide

00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:35,290
the code you just have to explain your

00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:37,390
method which like isn't even actually as

00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:40,810
robust as providing pseudo code it's

00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:44,020
it's really it's it's very different and

00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:47,820
um i guess if you were to do a diagram

00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,820
you might draw a picture of a computer

00:52:49,589 --> 00:53:06,240
mmhmm yeah right yeah so a thing that

00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:09,930
you may also find interesting is the

00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:13,119
context tree patent art tumblr which

00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:16,750
shows so it's a fellow who works in the

00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:18,520
gaming industry and um and he looks at

00:53:16,750 --> 00:53:22,599
gives a look at patents for his company

00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:24,430
in in the gaming industry area and so he

00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:27,550
found he's got maybe like five hundred

00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:30,869
different images of diagrams that are

00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:33,730
supposed to accompany the software

00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:37,420
underlying a game that some companies

00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:39,900
asked for patent on and they're they're

00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:43,359
pretty ridiculous you can see like where

00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:44,950
there's uh that one's good because its

00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:47,140
context free so you don't really know

00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:49,960
what the patent is so you don't endanger

00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:51,820
yourself as far as triple indemnity and

00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:54,250
he's really cherry picks some of the

00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,570
most ridiculous ones but uh you know

00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,510
there's like one where it's like a dog

00:53:55,570 --> 00:54:00,520
and it's like yes no like with word

00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,740
bubbles and it's like you know something

00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:05,950
about like how dogs behave in game or

00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:08,090
whatever but um so they do still include

00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:10,720
diagrams they're just it's not

00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:12,980
the same standard because it is abstract

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,580
there's I mean there's a kind of this

00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:18,350
whole history of patents becoming more

00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:21,020
and more abstract so like they were

00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:23,090
originally very mechanical and then kind

00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:25,430
of Pharma is like chemical like you can

00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:28,130
see it if you had a microscope and then

00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:30,860
business method patents are like oh it's

00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:33,410
kind of a it's a feeling or a flavor or

00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,810
something and then you get to like you

00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:41,780
know like math on a computer with some

00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:43,730
things and you know sparkles well that's

00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:46,520
a different it's a design pattern which

00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:48,140
is definitely not my wheelhouse does it

00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,580
no one else have a question because I

00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:53,150
can talk with folks out in the hallway

00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:55,900
to if we're just you know down to uh you

00:54:53,150 --> 00:55:01,060
know gossiping about silly patents

00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:01,060
anyone okay great thank you so much

00:55:45,230 --> 00:55:47,290
you

00:55:56,140 --> 00:56:00,070
your customers rely on your website or

00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,440
application if it's slower

00:56:00,070 --> 00:56:05,380
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:07,210
and costs you money keeping your

00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:10,660
business critical systems humming along

00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:13,030
requires insight into what they're doing

00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,980
your system metrics tells stories

00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:16,990
stories that can reveal performance

00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:19,330
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,890
other problems but how do you keep an

00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:23,470
eye on all of your systems performance

00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:26,500
metrics in real-time and record this

00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:28,270
data for later analysis enter longview

00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:30,310
the new way to see what's really going

00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:32,440
on under the hood the long view

00:56:30,310 --> 00:56:34,510
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:36,970
of all your systems providing you with a

00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:40,330
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:42,910
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:44,680
load and network usage click a specific

00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:47,050
system to access its individual

00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,590
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:52,000
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:56:49,590 --> 00:56:53,680
comprehensive network data including

00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:55,990
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,970
available on the network tab and disk

00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:00,100
rights and free space on the disks tab

00:56:57,970 --> 00:57:02,320
while the process Explorer displays

00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:04,840
usage statistics for individual

00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,090
processes the system info tab shows

00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,310
listening services active connections

00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,470
and available updates adding long view

00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:13,150
to a system is easy just click the

00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,310
button copy the one line installation

00:57:13,150 --> 00:57:17,740
command then run the command on your

00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:19,450
linux system to complete the process the

00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,610
agent will begin collecting data and

00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:25,150
sending it to longview then the graph

00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:27,400
start rolling use long view to gain

00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:31,720
visibility into your servers so when

00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,580
your website or app heats up it stays up

00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:35,560
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:38,440
you need to integrate manage and

00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:40,570
automate a virtual data center all on an

00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,970
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:45,730
platform and at a third of the cost of

00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:47,410
other solutions but why even bother with

00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:49,570
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:51,550
in the first place well let's say you

00:57:49,570 --> 00:57:53,830
have a traditional one server to one

00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:55,869
application architecture but you're

00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:58,180
running out of resources and performance

00:57:55,869 --> 00:58:00,720
is suffering once you ordered a new

00:57:58,180 --> 00:58:03,609
server hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:06,730
configure it install your business

00:58:03,609 --> 00:58:09,340
application stage and test the server

00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:11,440
and finally add it to your production

00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:13,690
farm if you've been through this process

00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:16,150
before you know it can take weeks or

00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:17,980
even months you also know it's a

00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:20,020
manually intensive process that will

00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:23,349
burden your team every time you outgrow

00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:25,119
your current setup with a virtual server

00:58:23,349 --> 00:58:27,880
solution you could accomplish all of

00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:30,460
that in less than half a day server

00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,290
virtualization software separates the OS

00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,720
and application from the underlying

00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:36,880
server hardware and with multiple

00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:38,589
virtual machines on a single server you

00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:41,589
can use each of them to run different
