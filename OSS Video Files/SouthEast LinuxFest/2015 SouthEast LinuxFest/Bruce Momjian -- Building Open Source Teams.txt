you

00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:18,850
no screen okay I didn't even okay I'm

00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:25,180
gonna advance I did I did I think you

00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:27,810
just want to put in my pocket okay hello

00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,180
everybody my name is Bruce pumpkin um I

00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:34,440
am one of the post Chris core team

00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:37,210
members and I work for enterprise DB uh

00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:39,100
but this talk is not really specific

00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,420
about postgres and it's not really

00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,430
specifically about what I do

00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,830
enterprise-d beats it's really about

00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:47,170
building open source teams so some of

00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:49,570
the things I've learned are in working

00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:51,100
with postgres are in this some of the

00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:54,580
things I've learned and work for

00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,560
enterprisedb uh I learned some of the

00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:59,759
things here I've learned from attending

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,330
leadership seminars and from reading a

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,690
sort of leadership material uh there's

00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,489
it's it's sort of part of its technical

00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,810
and part of it is the life lesson really

00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:15,640
in in sort of being a leader in in

00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:19,780
building groups to work on common

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,239
projects a lot of this relates to my

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:24,970
involved with the internet which started

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,470
I guess 1991 uh when I had internet

00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,709
connectivity my house and was running

00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:31,959
unix uh and got involved with some of

00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,209
the Usenet groups and some of the sort

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:36,280
of online communities way early on i

00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:39,880
remember when i was on the internet you

00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:43,950
know i had email and I'd explain to

00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,620
people what email was uh you know it's

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:50,049
well it's you send this electronic

00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,750
message and it goes out and then people

00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:57,310
it arise places and then it comes back

00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:00,790
and um III remember just sort of having

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,590
there was actually an email address book

00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,269
that was printed in the bookstores I

00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,010
mean you know that was very early on but

00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:08,950
I've been doing this for a long time I

00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,180
had learned quite a bit um and frankly

00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:12,100
there are some things that I think work

00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,670
really well and bully mobsters teams and

00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:18,310
there's really like caustic damaging

00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:20,769
things you can do in building open sores

00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,239
teams and I learned some of those uh and

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,120
that's what this talk is going to be

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,890
about

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,860
okay uh and I'm what I'm going to

00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:31,159
highlight as some of the things that are

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:32,599
unique about open source teams some of

00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,879
the distance requirements and the

00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,409
electronic requirements and then you

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,730
know working with volunteers there's a

00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:39,709
whole bunch of aspects here that I

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,840
wanted to cover but again I've been

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,599
working as an open source manager for

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,090
three companies start with postgres 1996

00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:50,720
but again my my involvement even goes

00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,510
before that um so what are we going to

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,250
talk about how do you build open source

00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:58,160
teams there's those three concepts that

00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,000
I think are fundamental to this and and

00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,440
uh I I get asked about this a lot I get

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,180
asked about this a lot of conferences

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,970
when I'm talking to people even last

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,370
night I was at the UH we had the party

00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:12,530
at 9pm at the at the restaurant and

00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,349
somebody was sort of explain how does

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,079
how did that work how did you kind of do

00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,180
this and how did it get started so there

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,630
there are some secrets to this first off

00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,039
is is motivation uh because you're

00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:28,010
building an open-source team by

00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:31,190
definition you're not typically

00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:33,229
monetarily motivating people and that's

00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,539
a challenge and then there's some

00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:38,150
challenges number two related to open

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,280
source management in sort of that whole

00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:41,870
span of things and then finally there's

00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,860
development process challenges we're

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:46,280
gonna we're going to kind of walk

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:48,200
through these one at a time okay so

00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:53,060
let's talk about open source motivations

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,000
um why why do people get involved with

00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,470
open source if you don't understand this

00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,039
you're you're really going to have

00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:03,139
trouble motivating anyone else because

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,289
again it's it's sort of a secret sauce

00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:09,830
that that is involved in getting people

00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:12,080
to to get involved with open source but

00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,449
at the same time and again there's a lot

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,860
of mysteries in this like for example

00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,360
like you look at all the software you

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,860
use and you're like well okay it's

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,470
developed by open source and whatever

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,940
but when you think will you tell me that

00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:25,070
the operating system Iran in the browser

00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,139
around and the word processor around and

00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:30,199
development tools I use they're all

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:32,060
developed by volunteers somehow people

00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:33,169
who all over the world who communicate

00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,460
by email they're developing this

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,830
software and it's actually a better

00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,690
quality than one done in the company and

00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,830
does that make sense I mean is that

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:42,440
sound like something that would be

00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,610
possible no it really doesn't um you

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:47,210
really said something that shouldn't

00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:49,520
work but indeed it does and you have to

00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:52,340
kind of dig down to some of the core

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:56,510
roots of why that works to sort of

00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,970
understand you know what what it is that

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:01,010
makes this thing work because on its on

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,380
the surface it sounds like it's

00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,090
something that wouldn't work okay so

00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,820
when I'm talking to people or you know

00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,650
I'm talking of non-technical people that

00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,810
I meet you know just people i meet at a

00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:15,020
party or church or whatever they're like

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,880
what do you do and i still think there

00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,410
was only a handful of people i've been

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,720
the same church 20 years i think is a

00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:23,390
handful of people who know like what I

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,340
do actually like you know uh you know

00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,140
they think well he travels a lot and he

00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:32,780
goes some odd countries every month and

00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:34,520
he works from home and you know I don't

00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:36,470
think a lot of them really understand

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,820
what i wrote a book years ago by

00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,430
postgres they think it's all related to

00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:43,520
that book I wrote no but that's the

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,860
closest they can get I guess so so the

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,510
question is what motivates people to

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,580
work on open source and there's really i

00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:51,350
think four fundamental things and it's

00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,110
really related to the URL here by the

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,030
way i should clarify that all this

00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,800
presentation is jack is actually

00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,590
available right now on that at that URL

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,520
so there's a volley 30 presentations now

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,930
uh the ones i did on friday about nulls

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,960
and security are on there and again

00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:12,530
probably 28 other ones are at that URL

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,310
including this one so um this URL here

00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:18,260
down at the bottom is an article the

00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,410
kind of talks about why people get

00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,600
involved in open source um there's also

00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:27,860
some other articles that kind of talk

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,420
about it arm but but the mythical man

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,490
month actually kind of references it a

00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:34,130
little bit but not open source but it

00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,470
sort of in a way um but there's tutorial

00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:40,640
formative things one professional

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:42,830
advancement learning new skills so this

00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,380
would be somebody who's wants to get

00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,930
involved more with with technology maybe

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:50,300
they're not getting that kind of

00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,789
feedback in their current

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,990
employment and therefore they do this on

00:07:52,789 --> 00:08:01,159
weekends or you know when they have at

00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,050
nights or sometimes during lunch the

00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,810
second was a practical need for the

00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:07,990
software uh they're actually working on

00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:11,330
open source not to help themselves

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:15,050
because i need that feature ok or i need

00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:17,270
something um I want to make sure that

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,490
that software keeps going and keeps

00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,770
growing and that's why I'm going to pour

00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,330
money into it because it's a fundamental

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:25,610
aspect of my business and therefore I

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,650
need it to succeed ok so it both of our

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,750
kind of mixed together one I need a

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,419
specific thing one I need the software

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,399
to keep growing the third one mental

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:37,339
stimulation this is not the same as

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,760
number one number one is more I want to

00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:42,800
grow in my professional life I want to

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,100
grow gain new skills that may be to be

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,200
employable okay number three mental

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,560
stimulation is I just like a puzzle I

00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:54,260
just like doing things that are

00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:57,170
challenging to help me sort of

00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,870
invigorate my mind and help me to sort

00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:02,029
of stimulate my mental processes that's

00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:03,829
another aspect of open source of the

00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:06,440
fourth one I believe in open source I

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:10,070
want to give back to the larger world

00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,329
that i'm working in ok uh and again open

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:12,620
source you would think be an odd way to

00:09:11,329 --> 00:09:15,440
give back to the wall but if you're a

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,079
technology person odds are you're not

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,360
going to be helping to build you know

00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:22,370
the next homeless shelter like you know

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,020
it's I'm not really good with power

00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:28,279
tools i'm probably dangerous with power

00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,670
tools um so if your skill is technology

00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:32,930
you want to give to the water world to

00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,779
open source might be a way of doing that

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:39,230
ok and what's really odd about these

00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:40,760
four things is that if you ask us an

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,760
individual who works in open source

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,890
which one of these like motivate you

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,660
they have trouble answering and they

00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,649
probably ansel a couple of them they

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,300
might say you know I think the mental

00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:56,120
stimulation and the professional

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:59,570
advancement probably and then a little

00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,279
bit of the fourth one and in fact when

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,370
you're working in open source community

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,350
it's very hard to identify with

00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:08,440
people are motivated by which things on

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,310
this list and that's another part of the

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,560
mystery of the process the people may

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:17,470
get involved because of one of these

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,779
items and they may stay for 15 years

00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,910
because of another one of these items

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:23,950
all right uh in fact if you look at the

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,730
postgres community most of our people

00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:30,070
have been there for like 5 10 15 years

00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:32,200
these are long-term people part of its

00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,910
because we have a very good community in

00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,320
a very positive community of beauty that

00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:37,480
people want to be a part of the people

00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,430
community that people feel my time spent

00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,410
with these with this software is useful

00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,610
this is a good use of my time they don't

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,700
think it's good use economy not going to

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:47,500
do it okay that's fundamental to pretty

00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,580
much anyone as a volunteer people

00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,740
volunteer because I think it's a good

00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,320
use of the time whether which of these

00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,820
four items I can't tell you but it's got

00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,160
to be a good use of their time for them

00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,900
to volunteer because they have other

00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,589
things to do they have time pressures

00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:04,870
right um so if you can build that into

00:11:02,589 --> 00:11:07,870
your project and this is sometimes why

00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,310
companies that try and sort of do fake

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,290
open source or open source that they

00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,440
control it doesn't work because a lot of

00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:15,850
these things just don't work um a lot of

00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:17,200
them like certainly believe in open

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,480
source you can kind of tell pretty

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
quickly practically for the software it

00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,810
kind of gets controlled by the company

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,290
it's not really open for you to be

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:31,180
involved in um mental stimulation is

00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:33,430
some extent so again you kind of have

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,370
these all reinforce each other in a sort

00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,440
of magical way uh if any of them are

00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:40,540
missing or you kind of tinker with it

00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,190
isn't that the play never got off the

00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:43,600
ground it takes a whole bunch of things

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,700
together to get a plane off the ground

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,060
um and you got to have all these

00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,370
together I'd say to really be successful

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:52,720
so why is another sort of aspect related

00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,360
to the mental stimulation wise

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,700
programming fun and this is again I

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,890
talked about mythical man month this is

00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,200
sort of a an idea that came out of that

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,150
book and I know there was a talk i think

00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:08,350
on fri they did also reference in the

00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,790
people a month um but but one of the

00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:12,670
things one of the reasons were here on a

00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:14,920
sunday instead of being a home is

00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,740
because we we kind of like programming

00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,480
is it the sort of attraction

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,640
for that to us i can say even as a child

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,160
that it was a very attractive thing to

00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:24,600
me in fact something he's too attractive

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,060
so i had to sort of walk away from it

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,860
for a while until i was ready to sort of

00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:34,440
deal with in a balanced way that's

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:36,600
little little self self visibility on my

00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,450
part um but but one of the interesting

00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:42,779
things about software versus building a

00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:48,420
statue or something that's something

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:51,149
that's um physical in terms of hardest

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,310
is that programming is fun because

00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:55,830
you're you're making things in a medium

00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:57,810
that's tractable in a medium that can be

00:12:55,830 --> 00:13:01,560
changed very easily with very little

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,089
cost on your part um and and and often

00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,060
the problems that we deal with a very

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:08,209
complex arm and these things that we

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,920
make are useful to other people so

00:13:08,209 --> 00:13:15,089
you've kind of got this connection of

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:19,589
things that like if I work on a on a

00:13:15,089 --> 00:13:21,720
statue of of like marble it's really

00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:22,950
expensive and then if I make a mistake I

00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,149
gotta go in to get another piece of

00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,730
marble right that's like hard uh

00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:31,770
software for some reason it's zero

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,839
almost zero cost to modify your cost to

00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:35,279
distribute to people in a lot of ways

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,089
you were useful than a marble statue

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,170
always more global in a horrible statue

00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:48,209
and again these all kind of work

00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:50,760
together yes sir yeah so the point was

00:13:48,209 --> 00:13:52,680
that that you're you're you're can be

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,899
very Napoleon istic and commanding your

00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:58,350
computer you have control over this

00:13:54,899 --> 00:14:00,540
thing that you're working on and I think

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:04,079
there is certainly an attraction to that

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,510
um that you got it to do what you wanted

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,880
it to do it may take a long time to do

00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:11,040
it but you know there is a sense of

00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,700
accomplishment there you created

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,640
something arm and and that you've you've

00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:19,980
mastered that particular thing and it's

00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:25,529
not a mastery of something that would

00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:30,829
deal with a sort of things you would

00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:30,829
manipulate with your hands but for me

00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,770
come

00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:41,190
but I mouse but I'm not not really good

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,550
at that I am really good that at doing

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,079
the mind part um so for me and I think

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,800
for a lot of other people in our

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,079
community who have that bend where we

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,639
know we're really good in that area is

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,139
sort of an amplification for that

00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,570
because instead of doing some little

00:14:55,139 --> 00:15:00,709
thing on my home computer that nobody

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:04,139
sees now I'm doing it on a global stage

00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:05,730
that everyone sees in fact one of the

00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:08,100
great things about open source is that

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,560
is that programmers usually are sort of

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,519
stuck in a little cubicle somewhere if

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,870
you think of commercial development

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,510
normally a professional you know

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,579
commercial software developer is in

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,740
their cubicle they go to the meetings

00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:23,910
they come home you know they go back to

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,980
the office and there's very little

00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:28,410
visibility or acknowledgement outside of

00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,089
that organization of what that person

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,279
does usually the people who are visible

00:15:30,089 --> 00:15:36,480
are the managers to some extent the

00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:38,510
sales people armed and and what open

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,490
source does is kind of flips it around

00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:44,069
you don't have really managers or or

00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:46,079
salespeople at all but now that the

00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:48,449
engineers are now on a global stage and

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,100
they're able to percolate up and that

00:15:48,449 --> 00:15:53,010
search that's the opportunity to shine

00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,760
in a way that really I cannot think of

00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,350
any I cannot think of any software

00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:02,100
ganization where the engineers are

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,660
shining i I mean I guess google has some

00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,370
i could probably think of a couple

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,620
engineers at Google who were really

00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:12,779
sharp folks arm I can't think of any

00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,170
really in any of the financial world I

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:17,760
can't think of any in the retail arm

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,500
again the manager might be the visible

00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:21,120
god but he's not really an engineer he's

00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,459
he might have been an engineer is an

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,230
engineer anymore right whereas you think

00:16:23,459 --> 00:16:27,540
of the postgres community of open source

00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,940
community the people who are visible in

00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,930
those communities are the engineers are

00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,800
the people who are doing engineering

00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:36,720
everyday arm so I think open source in

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,589
some ways ille gives you gives

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,380
engineer's a new visibility and a new

00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:46,890
ability to shine that is not possible

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,279
really an almost any other venue um and

00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:50,170
I think that's I think

00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,269
that's exciting I think it's I think

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,399
it's one of the things that that

00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:57,999
motivates our people you know we don't

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,079
we don't um prose Chris community I

00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:00,850
can't speak for the other communities

00:16:59,079 --> 00:17:03,129
really well push chris community does

00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:05,079
not have sort of the prima donnas or the

00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:06,429
you know they call me the shell horse

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:08,589
but i think they're always joking when

00:17:06,429 --> 00:17:10,030
they say that um yeah I was thinking I'm

00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,589
the horse who has like who can count

00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:16,000
before with the Hoover something you

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:18,939
know um but but we try to put we i

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,880
personally i'm always trying to promote

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:23,860
other people like i got enough you know

00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,049
i got enough people know i am i'm always

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,699
trying to bring up our other people

00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,990
because those are the people who are

00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:31,809
going to grow the organization those

00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,179
people who are going to be uh impacted

00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:35,980
by having them be visible and that's

00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,809
gonna motivate them and they deserve

00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,789
that and they've been working hard and

00:17:37,809 --> 00:17:41,260
they develop that super big feature and

00:17:39,789 --> 00:17:43,120
let's make sure they get to all the

00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:45,669
conferences to talk about it and you

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:49,090
know so I'm one of my goals is always to

00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:51,520
be pushing our folks up into that well I

00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:53,020
might try to stand back in the you know

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,429
when they take the group shot i'm trying

00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,220
to stay in the back because i want

00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:00,130
everyone else to be up front I don't

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:01,600
really care it's not it's not that big a

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:05,770
deal for me and it is a big deal for

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,020
some people so you know I got used to it

00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:09,340
so it's not does even when I was a

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,740
little kid it didn't really matter so

00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:14,830
maybe never never mattered to me but my

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,690
point is that did this is a really

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,490
exciting thing and I think the type of

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,320
conference we have and even just what

00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:22,179
we're doing here is is testament to that

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:34,200
other questions because i want to take

00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:34,200
questions i'm going ok yes sir yep

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,220
you

00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:05,770
so the question is how to what practical

00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:08,320
things do we do to promote the

00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:09,640
visibility of of Engineers that we have

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,260
in the community that's a great question

00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,690
i'll give you I'll give you a specific

00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:19,030
answer that I think is very illustrative

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:22,210
arm I go to Russia probably twice a year

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,610
three times a year and arm postgres

00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:27,820
historically said a very strong group of

00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:31,810
developers in Russia uh we didn't win

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,760
all the huge user community arm but we

00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,380
have so I'm sorry the question was yeah

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,320
how do we motivate specifically people

00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:42,070
in Russia so I we motivate people in our

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,310
in our group so um we have a lot of some

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,870
really great engineers in Russia arm but

00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:48,910
we don't have a huge user community in

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,040
Russia at least we didn't until very

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:54,640
recently so I had these engineers in

00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:57,970
Russia who are doing some amazing work I

00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,880
you know I you can say the whole world's

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:03,550
the same but it's not really uh you know

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,710
I the Russian things do you think things

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,870
that the Europeans wouldn't think of and

00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:09,670
the US people think do things the

00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:11,950
Japanese the Japanese you things that

00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:13,420
the you know I mean I'm Armenian and we

00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:17,800
do things nobody else does I mean you

00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:19,360
know in jeggings differently so of

00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,610
course everyone's different and there's

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,110
a whole spectrum of things but for some

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:27,430
reason because Russia has a large

00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:29,970
history of education and really I say

00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:32,590
that the idea of the puzzle kind of

00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:36,880
creativity is very big in that country

00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:39,550
um in a similar way to sort of the the

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,860
the user interface stuff is big in Italy

00:20:39,550 --> 00:20:44,620
in France you know they're really good

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:47,230
in that right uh and the Japanese are

00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:50,770
unbelievable in like detail stuff that

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:52,330
you know we're not good at so we we had

00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:55,060
some guys there and I've always tried to

00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:56,590
get work for them so I think there was

00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,080
one case where somebody they wanted

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:01,300
funding and I got my company funding for

00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,560
a while and then we had a new engineer

00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,390
in Russia who is doing some amazing

00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,880
things that nobody else in the world

00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,040
could do

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,520
they were doing these amazing indexing

00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:13,460
things arm so here's a guy who is

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:15,890
starting google Summer code and he wrote

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:20,180
this amazing indexing capability in

00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:23,900
Postgres as a couple years ago and uh I

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:26,300
was like okay so so let's make sure he

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,840
gets invited to the conference's it

00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:32,510
fully paid he's flying now to Madrid or

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,850
Prague and he's now talking to all these

00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:38,420
people and you know giving a talk I

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:40,730
remember one kind he fly he came into

00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:43,070
Dublin he flew into Dublin we had a big

00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,990
postgres european conference there he

00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:47,420
was talking about the JSON stuff we did

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,550
in Postgres 94 and some of the indexing

00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:52,250
stuff that he had developed and he was

00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:56,120
comparing posters to json and he puts a

00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:58,250
graph up on this slide and everyone

00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,520
starts clapping you know I've never seen

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:04,610
a graph be put up on a slide and having

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,010
audience just spontaneously going to

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,230
applause you know I mean it was that

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,390
much excitement that this guy what he

00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:14,480
had done and in fact it's changed the

00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,790
way postgres is adopted in the past year

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,350
because he has done this amazing thing

00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:21,800
with this particular type of index on

00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:27,580
json so my point is that here you've got

00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:30,080
somebody who's at the moscow nuclear

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:33,020
atomic university i think that's the

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,970
name I've spoken there I went he called

00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,500
he he emailed me and he said my

00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,890
university would like you to be a calm

00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:42,020
to speak and I'm like great just tell me

00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:44,450
when to come like I'm REE there and I

00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:47,720
went I spoke for a full day to their to

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,180
all their classes um so here you have a

00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,120
guy he's in a university in Moscow he's

00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:56,690
probably 22 23 he's I think work he's

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,820
finished his doctorate um but instead of

00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:02,720
being sort of shoved into a little

00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:05,720
company to work on some website or some

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,950
troubleshooting or new software that

00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:12,560
does email whatever you know text spam I

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:15,200
don't know whatever now he's you know

00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:17,540
he's name's Alexander Curt off he's goes

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,590
to every european conference he's going

00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:21,640
to be with me and

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:23,690
auto i think when we go next week um

00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:26,029
everyone knows his name in the postgres

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,620
community he started a company with some

00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:31,309
of the other russian guys now and

00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:33,320
they've got vc funding over there um you

00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:37,909
know he's getting married to a to a girl

00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:40,250
from uh the she's from belarus from

00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:41,809
minsk belarus so I got to know her I'm

00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:43,370
gonna see I'm going to go to I'm going

00:23:41,809 --> 00:23:45,380
to st. Petersburg next month and we're

00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:49,100
going to do stuff together and my wife's

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:51,080
coming to and so so what's really

00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,820
interesting is you have somebody who has

00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,309
incredible capability but instead of

00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,610
sort of being limited by his geographic

00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:01,490
area or whatever University went to he's

00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:03,020
now operating on a global stage in a

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,570
really to an extent that's really almost

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,240
impossible in in normal commercial

00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,789
software development because everyone

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,190
knows his name he has up his employment

00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:14,809
opportunities he's he's starting his own

00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:17,000
company with the venture funding with

00:24:14,809 --> 00:24:20,120
some other Russian guys he's speaking at

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,789
conferences you know his his fiancee's

00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,799
like wow this guy must be amazing you

00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:28,190
know he said that you know I mean I got

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:30,409
and even even something like I was in

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,289
Madrid and he introduces his girlfriend

00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:36,320
to me and I'm talking to her for 20

00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:37,970
minutes and asking her about man skin oq

00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,380
maybe even come to miss some day and we

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,809
can you know there's some companies I

00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:45,740
want you to talk and and we go and we

00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:47,539
sit in Madrid and Alexander is speaking

00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:51,559
and I'm sitting next to the girlfriend

00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:53,809
and I can see she has coached him in how

00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:57,110
and we both want him to succeed in this

00:24:53,809 --> 00:24:59,140
talk and I'm come if he says something a

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,760
little confusing I'm sure is saying uh

00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,230
do you mean this other thing and he's

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,059
like yeah that's what i mean so i'm

00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:06,590
trying to help the audience kind of stay

00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,090
with what he's saying because he's so

00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,760
brilliant that sometimes you can't

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:14,809
understand what he's saying as a normal

00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:16,549
person um and and you know at the end

00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,409
you know she like wow he did a great job

00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:22,039
you know was a great talk and everyone

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:24,380
understood and um so i think that's an

00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:27,200
example of of how you try and bring

00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,870
those people up and and again people see

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,980
that may see that if you work hard and

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,200
you do some creative thing that

00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:37,110
else could do or adds the community that

00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,190
there are pluses to that and and when

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:40,530
you're when you're working as a

00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:42,919
volunteer for years to get to that point

00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:46,169
is very hard to justify all that

00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,910
expenditure time but it it does you know

00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:49,650
a lot of sense pay often even in my case

00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,559
I worked for three years the volunteer

00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,059
before I became fully employed and I hid

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,490
how much time I spent for my wife for

00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,350
for quite a while and then she sort of

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:01,440
figured it out and then she said well

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:03,120
why you spending time in the basement

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,710
working on this volunteer thing instead

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,140
of spending more time with the family

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:10,020
you know if there's no answer to that

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,059
question um but then as your career went

00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:13,410
up and as you now became your now you

00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,510
look now they wanted me to be an author

00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,400
I wrote a book about postgres like home

00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:20,130
husband author maybe these things okay

00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,440
and now you have a job and you're like

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:25,260
oh now he has a job and he's working

00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,630
from home now and he's flying around and

00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:31,730
we're getting more money so it must be

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:34,049
good um so it's it's kind of a delayed

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:36,480
I'd say overture some ways is the

00:26:34,049 --> 00:26:37,860
delayed gratification because you do

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,929
this thing as a volunteer and there's

00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,340
really no there's no guarantee of

00:26:39,929 --> 00:26:43,169
anything whereas normally if you're an

00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,860
employee you get the job here's a salary

00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:48,660
you show up and is very predictable um

00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:51,150
but fortunately if you look at you know

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:54,900
some of the stuff we've done Peter gagan

00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:56,429
a guy from Dublin who now works in San

00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,460
Francisco he worked on the big feature

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:01,080
495 up sir and again he's going to be

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,460
the big guy for this year and he's going

00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,110
to be talking about it and everyone

00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:05,880
knows his name and he's named appears at

00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:09,480
the top of the release notes and so

00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:11,549
there is sort of this meritocracy and

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,370
when people do a good job you know you

00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:20,160
make sure that they get noticed other

00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:22,799
questions okay um so let's let's talk

00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,270
about having any talk about all the

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,940
wonderful things of why people want to

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:30,360
do open source let's talk about some of

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,309
the challenges um and you know i'm not

00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,690
going to minimize these challenges i

00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:36,270
will try and give you some solutions on

00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:38,790
how to do them but they exist and exist

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:41,460
in a big way and sometimes their their

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:44,760
overwhelming to people who start with

00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,250
open source arm I've kind of gotten used

00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,500
to

00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:49,240
it and I'm kind of good at it but again

00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,970
it's they are challenges you can't you

00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,820
can't deny him our communication that's

00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:57,640
probably your biggest one um you know

00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,070
how are you going to communicate to

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:02,890
these people because in a traditional

00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:05,520
business everyone comes into the office

00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:07,780
and there's no real communication

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,520
challenges there i mean there's going to

00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:12,130
be some jerks you can't talk to but in

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,440
general there's no challenges of how am

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,150
I going to actually talk to or

00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,910
communicate with my team I call on a

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:20,740
room I thought I I can look at the body

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:24,310
language I can know who's had a bad day

00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,260
I know who's not feeling well I know

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:27,400
who's not doing the job I can watch them

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:30,310
I mean there's a whole bunch of stuff

00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:31,870
that I get because I'm in a commercial

00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:33,730
environment they're forced to show up

00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,830
and we can all fit together we'll have

00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:38,560
any bat in the community right so we've

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,390
got to communicate by email we've got to

00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:42,250
communicate sometimes my telephone I

00:28:40,390 --> 00:28:44,380
used to do a lot of that I think I told

00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,150
you that but last night that I call

00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,680
people and I just say hey how's it going

00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,540
all right I get them on skype and how

00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,670
you doing how are you feeling about the

00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,320
release how do you think this particular

00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,600
issue went and you're now showing

00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,030
concern for the for the person instant

00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,740
messaging we use a lot group chat we

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,830
have an IRC channel that kind of helps

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,930
us uh we have a wiki for sort of stable

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:09,340
information that doesn't change a lot uh

00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:13,090
we have a software configuration manager

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:18,580
or what s um you know like like we use

00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:21,220
get so that kind of thing SCM uh-uh and

00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,290
we have conferences which is sort of our

00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,030
only time when we can all be together so

00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:27,280
we have a big conference in Ottawa I'm

00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:29,110
flying tomorrow from here to Ottawa and

00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,760
I'll spend a week there it's our big

00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:33,010
sort of developer conference for the

00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:35,170
year is always up in Ottawa but I got a

00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:38,830
conference in st. Petersburg next month

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:41,050
then another one in Texas and Vienna and

00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:43,570
San Francisco and you know all the way

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:45,040
out through the rest of the year and so

00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,230
those conferences allow us to kind of

00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:52,000
get together and sort of get to see each

00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:54,490
other in one room travel distance as a

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,210
challenge it's very expensive it's very

00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:59,030
time-consuming are you only often often

00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,470
you only have

00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,210
you people in one location I actually

00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:05,210
talked to you about this last night that

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,500
the idea of traveling when you would

00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,240
think would be a complete waste of time

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,680
like if I could send an email I can set

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,600
up a thousands of people why would I

00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,880
travel why would I come to a conference

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,070
like this is because for some reason

00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:18,320
when you're talking when you're taking

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,420
time to come to somebody city and spend

00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,540
time with them and you know tell jokes

00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:26,300
and eat lunch and go walking you know

00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:28,790
down to the store and then get lost and

00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,380
then go up the one-way road and all the

00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,940
other crazy things that you do hate

00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,180
Peters here all the crazy things that

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:37,640
you do arm that helps to build bonds it

00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:39,740
helps appeal help for people to

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,750
understand who you are understand why

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,460
what they're doing is important helps to

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:46,070
sort of show that what you're doing is

00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:47,570
valuable and that translates into people

00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,700
actually saying yeah I think I really do

00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,280
want to spend time on this in a way that

00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,170
you don't get when you just send an

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,850
email it's sort of like you know

00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,410
somebody showing up at your door or

00:30:55,850 --> 00:31:00,020
sending you getting a phone call versus

00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,370
getting like a postcard postcard in you

00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,380
know but if somebody shows up and

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,630
they've got a pie with them and we're

00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,990
gonna sit and have tea and let's talk

00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,700
about the the baseball game or whatever

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:13,040
even if they just showed up they didn't

00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,450
do anything related to work you know

00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,790
have it like if your boss comes to your

00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:19,910
house and like he's got like root beer

00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:22,070
and a pizza and we have a good time we

00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:23,600
sit around by the pool and he leaves he

00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,790
doesn't talk about work at all right

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,650
where I come in monday morning that boss

00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:30,590
doesn't look the same as the one I left

00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:35,420
on Friday right and and there's a magic

00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:38,540
to that that um you know I think I think

00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:40,490
is very important uh in fact you know

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:44,840
when i'm looking for leadership i'm

00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:53,960
trying to understand arm what is it

00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:55,970
about leadership that's key arm there's

00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,920
out i don't know how to explain there's

00:31:55,970 --> 00:32:02,420
there's a there's an unspoken arm

00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:06,260
importance to human relationships that

00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:09,790
you can't extrapolate out of ordinary

00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:11,870
life you know if everything was just uh

00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:12,410
everything was just like a balance sheet

00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:14,480
and you got

00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:16,610
under dollars and use okay I went to

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,470
work and I made that mound and I'll get

00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:21,380
this paycheck and then but that's not

00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:23,720
the way the world doesn't work that way

00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:25,790
uh that's not what makes people happy

00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,150
that's not what motivates people that's

00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:32,210
not what is important to people arm and

00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:35,600
and you know in fact if you look at and

00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:37,730
uh you know at leaders you have to model

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,350
a specific leader you can model like

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,510
steve jobs maybe think he was a great

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:43,370
leader you can model like the guy who

00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:45,470
had westinghouse you can think he was a

00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,330
great leader you can look at some of the

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:51,230
other people and you say was really well

00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:54,110
you know arm when I'm looking to see a

00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,850
great leader uh you know as a Christian

00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,940
I'm often looking for what how did Jesus

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:01,460
handle this like how did he do things

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:04,270
and when you look at that there it opens

00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:06,950
in a completely new Vista of

00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:10,070
understanding because he came here to be

00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:12,980
with us in a way that he didn't have to

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:16,250
do so when I think I'm going to these

00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:18,710
places I'm going because that's what he

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,510
would have done you know he didn't sort

00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:23,240
of sit up in the synagogue somewhere and

00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:25,790
just like shouted everybody right he had

00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,950
parties he went to places worth first

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,590
miracle was water into wine in a way

00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,240
okay and I have to understand it even if

00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,670
I don't agree with it I have to say

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,590
that's what I have to do you know and

00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:38,420
and if you look at some of the

00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,250
leadership John Maxwell is a great guy

00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,320
some of the leadership guys actually

00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,570
sort of key into that they understand

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,220
that there's a certain dynamic in a

00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:49,550
certain mystery leadership that really

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,770
doesn't translate a lot of times in the

00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:54,520
logic but it doesn't this because isn't

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:57,890
logical doesn't mean it's not important

00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,590
so I know that's a long answer I guess

00:33:57,890 --> 00:34:03,080
it fits for sunday morning but uh it is

00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:07,400
it is a challenge it is a challenge uh

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,870
time zones this is crazy like I to call

00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:12,169
somebody in Russia to get an answer on

00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:14,750
some crisis we had and I know the guy

00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:17,960
really well so like I call a cell phone

00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:21,050
and it's 1230 at night and he picks up a

00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,120
cell phone in in bed and he goes to his

00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,560
skype and I asked him ten minutes of

00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,760
questions about something happened in

00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,740
Moscow that day

00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,169
and I'm like I'm sorry I woke up buddy

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,290
you know I had to have the answer and I

00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:34,639
appreciate it and he goes back to bed um

00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:38,210
so you've got people in all sorts of

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,070
time zones um a lot of times cell phone

00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:42,080
stuff is good because people aren't in

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,030
the office the 925 thing doesn't work

00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:48,139
really well when I was working on

00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:49,490
projects once I had a case where I I had

00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:53,990
I was working on the windows poured a

00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:56,330
postgres and I had a guy in Sweden and I

00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:58,370
got a god in Australia so it was me

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,370
who's more the manager I had the guy in

00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:04,250
Sweden igon Australia so I would wake up

00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:07,730
in the morning and I would talk to the

00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:09,470
guy in Sweden because my morning was his

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:11,240
evening and because he was doing in off

00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:13,040
hours only he could really only work on

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,560
in the evening so that I'd worked during

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,950
the day and then like ten o'clock at

00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,650
night the guy in Australia would wake up

00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:24,920
and he will he worked in the morning so

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,960
I had these crazy days where I would

00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,730
have to get up early and work with the

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,110
guy in Sweden go through the whole day

00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,320
in the night from ten o'clock to like

00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:35,300
1am I work with the australian guy to

00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:37,070
address all the things the sweetened i

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,070
mentioned in the morning and that would

00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:43,010
just happen for months um because I had

00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,510
that's just what I had do I had guys all

00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,480
over with time zones and I had to be

00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:49,460
available almost all of it was on chat

00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,010
because that's the way they wanted to

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:54,380
work um but we got the job done they

00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:58,070
were great guys a Magnus Hauk endure and

00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:01,670
Claudio Nicoli in Australia you know

00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,960
it's kind of weird but you adjust I'm

00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:06,040
working from home helps because you're

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:10,190
not locked into 925 either right um

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,230
culture you have to really be um you

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,210
have to be mindful of this i worked for

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:16,790
japanese company for five years so again

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,500
i had a different style the Russians are

00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:19,670
different in the way they do things the

00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,560
Germans are different the way they do

00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:23,690
things latin americans are different the

00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,280
way they do things chinese are different

00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,920
Indians are different Pakistani

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,010
different than Indians um you really

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:32,420
sort of have to be so sensitive that but

00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,910
at the same time you're dealing with a

00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,190
global group so you can't you can't just

00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:39,500
shifter your whole culture to match one

00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,480
of them on and they understand that and

00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:43,850
usually um it works really well but you

00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:46,970
want to be sort of culturally sensitive

00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:49,010
in in in certain areas uh the Russian

00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:52,040
case for particular I you know we did I

00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:53,960
did in a way to Russia's had so much

00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,510
difficulty in the past couple years with

00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,760
the sanctions and everything so you know

00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:02,810
we were sensitive that we're trying not

00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,310
to add to it language um I hate to say

00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:06,980
almost everything we do is in English

00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:08,540
idols beginning but English uh I'm very

00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,620
good at speaking very simple English

00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:12,940
when I see when I go to foreign

00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:15,230
countries but language is an issue uh

00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,850
English is almost a requirement the

00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,800
email list we do have some language

00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:21,140
specific chat channels and email list

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,600
but in general a lot of the stuff is in

00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,960
English and it is a challenge I really

00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,130
wish I could do more in that area uh

00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,140
funding well this is a great what you

00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:34,370
have any money so you don't you have to

00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:36,020
work around um you know usually people

00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,900
will have money take money out of their

00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:41,000
own pocket to attend a certain level of

00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,560
conference fortunately most of the

00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,900
development they do they don't need

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,240
they're pretty much inexpensive internet

00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:50,180
connections so they don't that's partly

00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:51,830
doesn't a problem we do allow funding we

00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,320
have conferences who fund people so the

00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:58,550
auto conference fund is like maybe 10 or

00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:02,090
15 people every year fly a min um give

00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:04,220
them hotels uh and part of our spa the

00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:06,320
money we spend a sponsor as a company

00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:08,300
and part of the money was for admission

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,770
is basically to fund those developers to

00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,540
come in because the college wouldn't be

00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:12,710
the same without them like the

00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,300
conference would not be saying that the

00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:15,680
Russians weren't there because should

00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,390
not be seeing the Japanese weren't there

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,860
college would not be the same as of the

00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:20,570
Eastern European right there and again

00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:22,940
some of these people have big challenges

00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:25,070
and once they go a couple times they get

00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:26,450
visibility they get job offers then

00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,530
maybe a couple years down the line they

00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,880
don't need funding anymore because now

00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:31,490
they're companies going to fund them

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,050
because they're now uh you know they're

00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:34,490
now they now have income coming from

00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:38,900
postgres so a lot of that is

00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:44,420
bootstrapping finally development

00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:48,050
process uh this is again a a mysterious

00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:51,110
kind of area arm that doesn't sort of

00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:53,630
fit the typical Western Way of thinking

00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:55,549
of work but I think

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,009
if you I'm sorry think if you think

00:38:55,549 --> 00:39:00,950
holistically about it then I think it it

00:38:58,009 --> 00:39:03,380
does fit so summers will resonate with

00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:06,019
you in a way that monetarily it wouldn't

00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:09,380
arm so the first thing is to involve

00:39:06,019 --> 00:39:11,509
everyone obviously uh the the more

00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,210
hierarchical your organization is the

00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:16,970
less people feel they're part of it so

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:19,400
if if if somebody's joining organization

00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:22,700
they're saying well I'm like just to

00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:25,130
loot you know just a private and I've

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:27,140
got people over me and I've got generals

00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,720
over me and my sergeants always yelling

00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,349
at me and right does that person really

00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:34,369
feel part of the team not really they

00:39:33,349 --> 00:39:35,720
certainly don't think they're going to

00:39:34,369 --> 00:39:37,220
become a general Monday they're just

00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,380
like down there right they just want to

00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:40,759
get through it now I understand the

00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,480
military maybe has to be structured that

00:39:40,759 --> 00:39:47,269
way open source is not so the more Mary

00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,940
talk Merritt the less hierarchical you

00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:52,910
are the more people feel I am part of

00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:55,579
that team I can make a difference I can

00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:57,680
get involved my work matters the more

00:39:55,579 --> 00:40:00,650
you can inject that in the organization

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,269
the more you're going to get involvement

00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:04,970
of people the more higher cool we

00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:07,640
obviously the worst find each person's

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:10,339
motivator why are they involved what are

00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:11,509
they what makes them give their time to

00:40:10,339 --> 00:40:15,049
the community we talked about this

00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:16,430
earlier about motivating volunteers but

00:40:15,049 --> 00:40:19,160
there's certain things that really

00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:21,230
motivate it might be that that person

00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,960
wants acknowledgement publicly that

00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:26,569
might be there motivator there motivator

00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:28,990
might be fixing problems a fixer

00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:31,880
somebody who likes to fix things that

00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:34,240
might not be the same as the person

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:37,430
who's motivated by public recognition um

00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,289
it could be that they actually just want

00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:41,150
to get this feature into the software

00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:44,029
they don't care about any other things

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:46,250
right and the more you understand that

00:40:44,029 --> 00:40:48,069
other person's motivation the more you

00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:51,049
can make sure that they receive that

00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:53,450
what they're looking for right if you

00:40:51,049 --> 00:40:55,549
don't know then you're not really going

00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:57,230
to be but if you give somebody if

00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:58,789
somebody who looking for public

00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:00,859
recognition you just keep giving them

00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,970
hard problems there now you're not

00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:04,940
really taught you're not really speaking

00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:07,520
to them okay I mean there's there's a

00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:08,960
there's a very well known Christian book

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,870
called you know what somebody's love

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,660
language is it is it is it do they want

00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:17,480
praise do they want um you know acts of

00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:19,400
service do they want gifts and again you

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,810
have to look and don't assume that your

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:23,240
love language is the same as the other

00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:24,470
person you look at that other person and

00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,150
they're gonna have something completely

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:27,470
different that motivates them and you

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:29,990
have to be objective enough to

00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:31,700
understand I know that my wife's love

00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,770
languages are comfort different than my

00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,530
love languages and you if you understand

00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:38,900
that then you're gonna even use you say

00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:44,510
it doesn't mean anything to me that you

00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:47,060
tell me I am I'm uh accident words of

00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,620
praise that mean nothing to me right but

00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,970
it may mean a lot to that other person

00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:52,430
right and then you need to understand

00:41:49,970 --> 00:41:55,390
that reach at the individuals I talked

00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:59,150
about this before the idea of actually

00:41:55,390 --> 00:42:02,150
spending one-on-one time with people i

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,860
know in organization almost all the

00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:05,960
managers are required to have one-on-one

00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,690
meetings with all employee all their

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,580
report ease every week and I know it's a

00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:12,680
huge burden i'm not a manager sorry i

00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,090
can't even speak to it but i know that

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:16,160
they have scheduled one-on-one time with

00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:17,630
a lot of the report is because it's

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,490
important that you have that and

00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:22,100
particularly an organization it's

00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:23,780
distributed right if it's if everyone's

00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,040
in the same building while you go to

00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,660
lunch with one day go to lunch with

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:28,520
another day it doesn't matter you see

00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,590
him the hallway you go to me's with them

00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:32,360
that's not true so a lot of times you

00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,670
want to take that one on one time and

00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:37,250
that means a lot to people it really it

00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:39,380
really does um harvest the strength of

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:41,420
the team know who your team mates are

00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,670
you know if you're fielding a baseball

00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:45,830
team you know who the best picture is

00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,560
you know the best first baseman is you

00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:50,810
know the best shortstop is find out who

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,510
your good people are when you have a

00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:56,150
problem know who those people are go to

00:42:53,510 --> 00:43:00,020
those people okay so a lot of times

00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:01,760
you'll go per se alvaro i know you're

00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:04,040
really busy but i got this we have this

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,660
problem I know you're really good at

00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,110
this I really need you to look at it for

00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:10,790
me and they're like okay you didn't give

00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:13,370
him anything you didn't pay them you

00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:15,740
didn't but you basically said you are

00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:17,570
the guy for this thing I know that I

00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:19,760
know it's going to be hard I will help

00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,110
you as much as I can but I really need

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,050
you to look at this and I

00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:26,090
really need this this change made and it

00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:27,860
gets done and that person will go that

00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:29,720
extra mile partially because you've

00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,700
already built the relationship with that

00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:33,800
person and you've already spent time

00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:35,690
you've already showed that person that

00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,220
that person is valuable to you and

00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:41,720
you've already shown that that you've

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,550
already understood that person's love

00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,260
language and you understand how to

00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,810
communicate to the person in a way that

00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,980
that person values and i'm really not

00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,700
saying this in a way to manipulate

00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:55,130
people i'm really trying to say don't

00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,570
treat everyone the same understand who

00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,180
they are as individuals and speak to

00:43:56,570 --> 00:44:00,590
them as individuals okay and you know

00:43:59,180 --> 00:44:02,630
honestly love them as individuals

00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:05,210
because that's what you want to happen

00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:06,980
is when you're on a team okay you don't

00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:08,990
want them not to care about you and

00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:12,920
that's the worst feeling in the world so

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:15,530
you don't want that arm number five

00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,290
that's hilarious there's always someone

00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:20,230
smarter than you this is incredibly how

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:23,570
many does that resonate to anybody here

00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:26,090
okay that is incredibly humiliating at

00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:31,720
least to me it was where you work on a

00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:35,000
patch and you spend uh I don't know uh a

00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,590
week or four days working on a patch and

00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,000
you're like oh it's gonna have this

00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:42,290
feature it's going to be super wonderful

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,740
and you're like okay I tested it and I

00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:47,570
went through all the code and here here

00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:50,090
the world is my patch and you send it

00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:53,000
out and thousands of people all of a

00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:58,400
sudden can see your patch and somebody

00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,230
in the Czech Republic goes why did you

00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,730
do that right there that's wrong you

00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:05,360
need to do this other thing and you're

00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:07,520
like oh yeah that's right you know and

00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:12,500
you're like oh because what they've done

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:16,070
is they've exposed a flaw in your mental

00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:18,620
ability right and then somebody from

00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:20,900
Brazil goes all I don't know about that

00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,430
thing but this other thing is we've got

00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,260
it that you can't that's got to be done

00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:28,220
differently and then there's a third guy

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:30,520
from Canada who you know has some other

00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:33,290
thing and and and you might go through

00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,750
seven a duration to this patch where the

00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:36,900
time you

00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:38,730
get it done and you're like you feel

00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,040
that this call because everywhere

00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,810
everybody now knows that you can't spell

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,120
things and you obviously can't see

00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:48,150
obvious bugs that appear to everybody

00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:50,040
else it seems um but the thing that you

00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:51,750
have to remember is that the guy in

00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:53,610
Brazil and the Czech Republic in cab

00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,580
there are different people the guy in

00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:58,770
Canada didn't see the bug the Czech

00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:03,680
Republic I saw and he didn't see a thing

00:45:58,770 --> 00:46:06,420
that Brazil guy saw so the point is that

00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,250
you want to harness the ability of all

00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,500
your people so just because you didn't

00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:12,690
see the things he doesn't mean there's

00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,030
other people are written that patch they

00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:18,750
probably couldn't have but they were

00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:21,240
good enough to see your mistake ok so

00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:23,100
the beauty of this system if it's done

00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,680
right this is really that I think the

00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:29,190
the crux of why open source is so

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:32,100
powerful is the chernow amplifying your

00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:34,230
ability by taking the best ideas from

00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:37,110
thousands and thousands of people and

00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:39,270
putting it into every single patch and

00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:41,670
this does not happen effectively in

00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:43,680
organizations in companies in closed

00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:45,450
source development because again there's

00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,710
usually very little motivation for

00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:49,260
people to look at what other people are

00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:51,030
doing there's very little it's a very

00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,280
small organization you're just looking

00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,800
at whoever the company happened to hire

00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,630
on a particular day and they're not

00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,620
really looking for improving things are

00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:00,540
not really looking for cool they have

00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,970
other employees of other things to worry

00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:05,430
about they're not really looking unless

00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:08,310
a very obsessional closed source

00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:11,880
organization that would have the kind of

00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:13,470
of ability to critique and amplify the

00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,970
ability of all employees I'm sure there

00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:16,290
are organizations out there but that's

00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:19,790
not the tip that's definitely not the

00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:24,720
typical and even if they have they have

00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:27,540
15 engineers 15 engineers 2025 injures

00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:31,200
they don't have thousands of engineers

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:34,200
okay arm and again that that ability to

00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,940
get the best out of everybody to have me

00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,800
create it and have people from all over

00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,930
the world be able to improve it

00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,120
incrementally that's why I open source

00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:43,920
is so powerful that's why they're all

00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,840
he's so good and the technology so good

00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:48,010
and why we're here even though but

00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:50,620
source has no money and a lot of other

00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:52,300
limitations when folly please work

00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,160
people can be / people can be proud of

00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,440
people don't want to be on a losing team

00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,210
people don't want to be on a team where

00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,520
we can't do anything right okay they

00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:02,260
want to be on a team where I'm proud of

00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,140
what we produce I'm proud of what we put

00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:06,250
out arm and and again that's part of it

00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,210
that doesn't mean we should code

00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:11,680
everything I when we mess up I am very

00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:13,300
very loud and telling people we've

00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:16,330
messed up and where I mean I'm and and

00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:19,150
and we I'm embarrassed okay but again

00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:21,220
that usually just for a motivator so we

00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:24,900
understand that this we've failed here

00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:27,370
and we need to we need to step up um

00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:29,740
another requirement of course because

00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:33,280
you have volunteers is you gotta have

00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:35,440
clean code uh if you have if you hire

00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,060
somebody work on code they're going to

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,000
work on it doesn't matter how messy it

00:48:37,060 --> 00:48:42,280
is okay if you're hard to work on the

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,350
piece of code then you're going to make

00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,700
the best of it it might be horrendous if

00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,620
they have no comments it might be

00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,120
completely unintelligible but you're

00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,880
hard to do it so you will figure out a

00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:53,560
way you cannot do that with open source

00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,650
people are not being paid to look at

00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:58,780
your ugly code so code clarity is

00:48:56,650 --> 00:49:01,390
actually very very important in that

00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,190
environment because they've people have

00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,890
got to be able understanding easily

00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,270
you're not paying him to do it on and

00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:09,250
you also have to have good quality

00:49:07,270 --> 00:49:11,260
documentation because again that rolls

00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:18,670
back to producing work you can be proud

00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:22,360
of and finally arm this is sort of a

00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:25,420
summary uh lead by example not from

00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:27,700
authority uh again I talked about the

00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:30,040
idea of having a very non hierarchical

00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:31,960
organization so people feel that they're

00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:36,400
part of that organization they feel like

00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:39,520
that that I am helping I am really part

00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,880
of this team and my contribution counts

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,980
okay uh that's really important like if

00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,020
you think in the military they're not

00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:48,850
really trying to help people think of a

00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:50,920
part of team because they control all

00:49:48,850 --> 00:49:53,830
their soldiers you know when a sergeant

00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:56,140
says you have to go over there the guy's

00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:57,760
gotta do it you don't really need to be

00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:00,700
motivated he's got to do it like there's

00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,870
no it's not what you're not trying to

00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:04,390
motivate them as a volunteer

00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:05,620
here to go peel the potatoes like he's

00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:09,610
gonna do whatever you tell them to do

00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:12,850
okay um that so they don't have to have

00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:16,180
a meritocracy type of environment but

00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:17,800
but in in an open source team you have

00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:19,870
to because these people are volunteer

00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,640
you can't force you to do anything so

00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:24,370
you're always trying to lead from

00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,380
example you're trying to be what we call

00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:27,850
a servant leader somebody who's there to

00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:31,420
serve not who they're somebody's there

00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:33,430
to sort of dictate or you know browbeat

00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:36,700
people or that's just not going to work

00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:37,900
um see the value of other people's

00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,250
opinions just because you don't agree

00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:41,650
with somebody doesn't mean it's not a

00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:44,350
valid opinion and a lot of times in our

00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:45,940
discussions what happens if I've opinion

00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:49,000
on something somebody has a disagreement

00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,830
um we'll have a long conversation the

00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:52,450
the right opinion might be somewhere in

00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:54,640
the middle of the two opinions it might

00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:56,020
not be my opinion and it might not be

00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:58,840
his appeal but it might be somewhere in

00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:00,790
the middle so the idea of valuing other

00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:03,760
people's opinions just as you'd value

00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:06,040
their code contributions when somebody

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,160
says that variables poorly named I'm

00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:11,890
like I really want to say no I really

00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:14,980
want to say no I like my name but you

00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:16,510
know if I have to admit that he might be

00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:20,860
right you know cuz I'm going to be

00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:23,470
biased on my own naming and if it makes

00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:25,270
him feel like he's contributed by

00:51:23,470 --> 00:51:27,760
renaming it and it's slightly better

00:51:25,270 --> 00:51:29,980
let's rename it it's a patch it's a

00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:34,720
moment there below we can see it right

00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:36,790
um if it's worse don't do it but if it's

00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,470
marginally better and you're gonna have

00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:41,170
to eat crow to do it eat the crawl and

00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:43,360
make the change right because you're

00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:44,680
enabling that community process you're

00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,040
nailing that person to be part of that

00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,570
patch arm accept failure gracefully

00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:54,490
that's again exactly what I'm saying

00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:56,770
that when people do things when when you

00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:58,660
fail when some you tried didn't work

00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:01,690
when you apply patch that broke

00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:03,610
everything uh you know you you have to

00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:06,340
you have to kind of eat that humble pie

00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:09,310
you're you're you're you're working in

00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,810
it it's sort of like you're working in a

00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:12,790
global environment like you took your

00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:14,590
skirt your skull off and like everyone's

00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,790
staring at your brain like that's kind

00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:18,070
of environment you're in

00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:20,710
right and you're working in a global

00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:22,390
stage so there's going to be failures

00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,890
are going to be embarrassments there's

00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:25,930
going to be and you just have to say you

00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,820
know I'm working a global stage if I was

00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:30,310
in a little cubicle and I was writing

00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:31,600
code I wouldn't have that problem but

00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:33,130
you know I wouldn't have any of the

00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,620
advantages here and I have to just I

00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:40,300
have to I have to suck it up see

00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:42,670
consensus arm again that community by

00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:45,310
seeking consensus your magnifying all

00:52:42,670 --> 00:52:48,070
those abilities all those sort of brains

00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:50,260
to work together to come to a bet um a

00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:53,380
good solution and then don't be ruled by

00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,840
deadlines because uh that consensus

00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:58,120
sometimes takes longer than it would

00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,740
within a company the company you can

00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:02,440
basically say we are going to decide at

00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:05,200
this meeting x I cannot do that none of

00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:08,230
our communities guys can do that uh what

00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:11,550
we can do is to set an expectation set

00:53:08,230 --> 00:53:14,110
sort of a goal and and lead by example

00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:15,730
but we have to wait we have to wait for

00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:18,400
that process to run because we really

00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:20,740
don't have control over it um that's

00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,360
part of the process of having volunteers

00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:24,490
that part that's part of the process of

00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:28,180
helping everyone feel in power that we

00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:30,160
don't have the ability to do that that's

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:34,450
all I kind of wanted to go over again a

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:38,110
lot a lot of stuff really to to sort of

00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:39,520
for you to digest arm I'd like to take a

00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:40,660
couple minutes a question so I think we

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,260
have three minutes or something like

00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:47,880
that to grab some questions but six

00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:47,880
minutes great questions great yes sir

00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:16,310
so the question is um somebody see some

00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:17,869
code they develop a patch and then it

00:54:16,310 --> 00:54:22,640
seems like it takes a long time for

00:54:17,869 --> 00:54:24,740
anything to happen okay arm so that

00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,349
that's a challenge for open source

00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:30,200
communities I guess um if you think of

00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:31,430
in the corporate world uh the corporate

00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,839
world everything pretty much comes from

00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:35,630
the bottom the top down so everything

00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:37,730
comes from marketing or sales and and

00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:40,160
then to some extent testing is going to

00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:42,290
drive what things you work on in the

00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,050
corporate environment uh in the

00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:46,880
obviously the community environment um

00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:48,500
somebody's going to want to add

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,680
something to the software and how does

00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:54,560
that process happen um we try and

00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,390
effectively document how to do that we

00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:58,099
if there is a to-do list and we try and

00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:00,109
document like the steps you should go

00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:02,569
through before writing the patch

00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:05,210
actually we tell people send an email

00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:07,910
and get approval get under acceptance of

00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,740
the idea of the bubbly feature the idea

00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:10,970
the change so that you're not writing

00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,740
something and then we're saying oh we

00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:16,220
don't want it let's talk about it first

00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:18,619
so so we try and inculcate that type of

00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:21,170
process so they're getting feedback

00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:23,750
early on whether this is a fruitful

00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,910
direction to go in so knowing they have

00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:28,010
a typically what we're gonna ask them to

00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:29,960
do is we're going to say first get

00:55:28,010 --> 00:55:32,119
approval for the idea then get approval

00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,220
for the implementation how we we now

00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:35,540
agree we want to do it how you want to

00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,119
do it what things you what does he want

00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:39,740
the syntax to be how what modules you're

00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,390
gonna modify how is it going to operate

00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,310
what's the user interface going to be

00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:44,990
and then once you've got that approve

00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:47,869
that kind of agreed on in the community

00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:50,030
then we you actually write the patch the

00:55:47,869 --> 00:55:52,040
patch shows up we tell you to put it in

00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:55,339
a commit fast and eventually we'll we'll

00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:57,470
review it and probably apply it so what

00:55:55,339 --> 00:56:00,170
we do have trouble with is people who

00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:01,910
just sort of like they don't understand

00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:03,710
this whole community thing exists they

00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:05,270
haven't seen how to get involved they

00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:08,060
haven't read the d-list ever looked at

00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:09,380
the developers faq at all so they they

00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:11,450
have they're just kind of showing up

00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:13,190
they say I'm gonna write a patch they

00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,690
haven't gone through that and that could

00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:17,990
be a very jarring experience because

00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:20,000
again with our process we have to now we

00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:22,619
have to not take the patch and we have

00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:27,269
to walk you back to stat stat

00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:29,430
and say okay tell me why we want this

00:56:27,269 --> 00:56:30,960
okay now let's talk about the month a

00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:33,720
and you've already got the package done

00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,559
right and you're feeling very bad so

00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:39,680
it's a it's a process problem arm that

00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:42,150
there is a community it's hard for us to

00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:44,039
understand if it's a bug fix that's

00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:46,079
pretty easy because we know we want the

00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:48,150
bug fix right but but in terms of

00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:49,680
features it usually needs to walk that

00:56:48,150 --> 00:56:52,289
process a lot of times we have to take

00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,440
people back a little bit and walk them

00:56:52,289 --> 00:56:57,450
through the email of discussion of

00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,039
getting them to that passionate about

00:56:57,450 --> 00:57:01,799
your modifier patch couple times then

00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,109
get applied what we don't want to do is

00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:05,970
have somebody report a bug or send a

00:57:04,109 --> 00:57:09,660
patch and like they don't get any reply

00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:12,559
that's like the worst so one of my job's

00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:15,359
is to look at that email thread every

00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,339
every so often and look maybe a month

00:57:15,359 --> 00:57:19,529
back and say hold what did we do with

00:57:17,339 --> 00:57:22,410
this nobody's replied to it like what

00:57:19,529 --> 00:57:24,089
like why we know you know let's get some

00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:26,430
discussion on this so I try and go back

00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:28,619
and make sure that people do get that

00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:30,210
that kind of feedback but it's it it's a

00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:33,150
process problem definitely because you

00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:35,970
have unknown actors sort of showing up

00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:39,480
at unusual parts in the process and

00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:42,869
wondering why that showing up isn't

00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:45,019
working and that's yeah challenge yes

00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:45,019
sir

00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,820
yeah so the question is how you deal

00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,460
with members who are contributing the

00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:12,480
community but also through their

00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:17,400
behavior alienating them um a lot of

00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,680
times that's going to be uh something

00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,020
that the core team is a group of six

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,330
core team members and the core team is

00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:26,490
typically going to be involved there so

00:58:24,330 --> 00:58:28,830
so in that environment typically

00:58:26,490 --> 00:58:30,120
somebody in the core team has some sort

00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:33,270
of personal relationship with that

00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:34,740
individual okay because obviously doing

00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:36,090
that on the list is never going to work

00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:38,040
trying to correct it on the list that

00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:40,590
we're going to work a lot of times it's

00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,510
me but again we have six of us so a lot

00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:46,080
of times is someone all fit some someone

00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:48,630
else arm but you'll basically you what

00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,220
the point is that you you want to be in

00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:52,140
an environment we've already built

00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:55,620
relationships with those individuals so

00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:57,570
you're not showing up as the bad guy

00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:58,770
right you've already got relationship

00:58:57,570 --> 00:59:00,300
with that person you already know that

00:58:58,770 --> 00:59:02,220
person understand why the motivate you

00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,450
understand what they're doing you're

00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:06,000
thankful you're grateful what they've

00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:07,800
done so you've already got a rapport

00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,800
with them and then you need to have that

00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:14,670
hard talk and you need to say listen uh

00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:17,100
John you know it's we have an issue here

00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:19,980
I think it's hurting other individuals

00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:21,240
um and yen you don't say a lot you

00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,790
actually try and get the other person to

00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:25,350
talk and and to a certain extent they're

00:59:23,790 --> 00:59:27,330
they're gonna understand that they're

00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:29,160
gonna they're kind of going to know

00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:31,140
because the the type of things that

00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,580
they're doing in the community or things

00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,870
that they probably and you don't know

00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:36,450
this these are probably things they've

00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:38,880
historically had personality

00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:40,530
difficulties with in the past so when

00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,630
you're mentioning this it's not like Oh

00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:46,920
what do you have three legs a they

00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:49,320
already have a framework to understand

00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:53,550
this and because you're talking in a way

00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:54,870
that's not they also shares care for

00:59:53,550 --> 00:59:57,720
them like you're not just sort of

00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,700
unloading on them arm and trying not to

00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,590
say too much or you know and letting

00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,390
them talk usually though they're gonna

01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,950
walk through and they say yeah I think I

01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:07,620
can do better than I you know that I'm

01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:09,030
doing and you're like oh I appreciate

01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,980
your work on this thank you very much

01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:12,180
and then that's it and then nothing make

01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:13,380
all of it you may have to come back in

01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,750
three months and say

01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,910
um I think we still have an issue here

01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:20,670
you know and then you know you may need

01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:22,320
to come back few months later um and and

01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:23,670
say we're still and then you know if you

01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:28,350
need to then you need to ratchet up the

01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:30,420
the the ramifications of what they're

01:00:28,350 --> 01:00:33,660
doing if they're really not kind of

01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:36,750
coming along but fortunately we've we've

01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:38,220
had that in a very rare cases I'm very

01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:40,200
proud of that I know that many open

01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:43,110
source communities not that way so I

01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:45,780
think I've run out of time and I want to

01:00:43,110 --> 01:00:48,500
thank everybody for attending and I

01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:48,500
think it's lunchtime

01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,660
you

01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,030
you

01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:16,550
you

01:01:28,369 --> 01:01:31,789
your customers rely on your website or

01:01:30,259 --> 01:01:34,130
application if it's slower

01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:37,099
non-responsive it infuriates your users

01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:38,900
and costs you money keeping your

01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:42,410
business critical systems humming along

01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:45,260
requires insight into what they're doing

01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:47,240
your sista metrics tells stories stories

01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:49,730
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,770
resource limitations and other problems

01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:53,599
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:01:51,770 --> 01:01:55,910
your systems performance metrics in

01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,849
real-time and record this data for

01:01:55,910 --> 01:02:00,650
leader and analysis enter longview the

01:01:58,849 --> 01:02:02,900
new way to see what's really going on

01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:04,880
under the hood the longview dashboard

01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:06,559
lets you visualize the status of all

01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,109
your systems providing you with a

01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:12,559
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

01:02:09,109 --> 01:02:15,140
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:16,910
load and network usage click a specific

01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:19,339
system to access its individual

01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:21,970
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:24,410
on chokepoints and get more detail

01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:26,119
comprehensive network data including

01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:28,460
inbound and outbound traffic is

01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:30,680
available on the network tab and disk

01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:33,410
rights and frisks tab while the process

01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:36,319
Explorer displays usage statistics for

01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:38,240
individual processes the system info tab

01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:40,609
shows listening services active

01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:42,980
connections and available updates adding

01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:44,569
long view to a system is easy just click

01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,490
the button copy the one line

01:02:44,569 --> 01:02:48,500
installation command then run the

01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:50,480
command on your linux system to complete

01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,190
the process the agent will begin

01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,210
collecting data and sending it to

01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:57,980
longview then the graphs start rolling

01:02:55,210 --> 01:03:00,109
use long view to gain visibility into

01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:03,490
your servers so when your website or app

01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:05,320
heats up it stays up

01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:07,540
citrix xenserver gives you everything

01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:10,510
you need to integrate manage and

01:03:07,540 --> 01:03:12,670
automate a virtual data center all on an

01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:15,040
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

01:03:12,670 --> 01:03:17,560
platform and at a third of the cost of

01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,210
other solutions but why even bother with

01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,369
virtualizing your server infrastructure

01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:23,320
in the first place well let's say you

01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:25,630
have a traditional one server to one

01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:27,640
application architecture but you're

01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:30,190
running out of resources and performance

01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:32,490
is suffering once you order new server

01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:35,380
hardware you'll wait for delivery

01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:38,260
configure it install your business

01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:41,050
application stage and test the server

01:03:38,260 --> 01:03:43,240
and finally add it to your production

01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:45,400
farm if you've been through this process

01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:47,920
before you know it can take weeks or

01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:49,810
even months you also know it's a

01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:51,760
manually intensive process that will

01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:55,060
burden your team every time you outgrow

01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:56,830
your current setup with a virtual server

01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:59,619
solution you could accomplish all of

01:03:56,830 --> 01:04:02,200
that in less than half a day server

01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:04,030
virtualization software separates the OS

01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:06,430
and application from the underlying

01:04:04,030 --> 01:04:08,590
server hardware and with multiple

01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:10,300
virtual machines on a single server you

01:04:08,590 --> 01:04:13,300
can use each of them to run different

01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:15,070
os's and applications this makes it

01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:16,840
possible to move your virtual machines

01:04:15,070 --> 01:04:18,910
from one piece of hardware to another

01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,190
whenever you want to maximize

01:04:18,910 --> 01:04:23,140
utilization simplify maintenance or

01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:25,450
recover from a hardware failure and

01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:28,390
without slowing down your applications

01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:31,480
or users clearly server virtualization

01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:34,480
provides big benefits and Citrix

01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,700
