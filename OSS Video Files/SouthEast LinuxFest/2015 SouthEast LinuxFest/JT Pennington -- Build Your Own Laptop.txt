um and if you decide yes I'm actually

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:04,010
gonna do this you officially are awesome

00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:06,260
there are some simple options out there

00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,200
if you don't want to really get neck

00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,460
deep in it probably you may have heard

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,869
of some of these one of them I know

00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,520
you're aware of because it was actually

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:15,440
at registration and that's using the

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,610
motorola lapdock and hooking up a

00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,560
Raspberry Pi and you can pretty much use

00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:21,500
any of the raspberry PI's the a's the

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,390
bees the B pluses and the twos that's

00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,780
the most simple thing here's an example

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,500
of one you just have to make the

00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:32,570
Frankenstein cable to connect the HDMI

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:34,610
from the pi into the mini HDMI on the

00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:36,200
lap doc I actually have one of these it

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,280
does work great but you're limited by

00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,590
the Raspberry Pi the second option is

00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,630
the PI top this has been talked about on

00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,890
wired it's been on the net for probably

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,310
about a year and a half maybe two years

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:53,750
now somebody turned up a raspberry pi

00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,679
into a little handheld laptop I guess at

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:59,000
that point it would be called a palmtop

00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:00,619
um you'll see the case there's the

00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,570
actual Raspberry Pi itself they put an

00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,790
SSD they stripped it out of the case did

00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:06,470
some soldering wired it all up and the

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:09,950
keyboard covers up the actual battery

00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:14,060
pack um I have a friend who tried to

00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:15,620
make one of these it works nice but it

00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,829
wasn't for me so I was looking for

00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:20,660
another option that led me to of course

00:02:18,829 --> 00:02:24,950
the information and we just lost the

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,290
screen yes it is a 3d printer can we go

00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:30,110
back to that yes the entire case right

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:33,549
there is 3d printed I believe the plans

00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,720
are online but don't quote me on that

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,370
the next option that some people have

00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:39,560
heard of is probably the PI top I was a

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,079
crowdfunding campaign and it is a fully

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,090
3d printed case and then you get all the

00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:46,609
accessories there's a picture of it

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:49,280
broken down they did custom make one of

00:02:46,609 --> 00:02:52,430
the boards for inside this and there's

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,350
the whole kit laid out umm this is nice

00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:56,840
if you don't have a lot of actual

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,459
hardware electronic skills for soldering

00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:59,810
because for the most part this is

00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,930
plug-and-play you are going to have to

00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:04,970
do some minor soldering but it's nothing

00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:06,470
that even an amateur couldn't do if they

00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,239
spend five minutes in practice on wires

00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,160
and just circuit boards that they can

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,870
kill just to kind of get the hang of it

00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,090
and there are plenty of YouTube's online

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,740
to about simple wire or soldering

00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,540
techniques if you've never done it

00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:19,340
before don't be scared of a soldering

00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,710
gun be careful with it because it has

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,570
obviously very hot but there's no reason

00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,700
to be intimidated by a soldering gun it

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:27,140
is a tool like tons of other tools that

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,010
you use on a daily basis you just need

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:34,100
how to learn how to use it properly

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:35,390
another option exists is the novena this

00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,470
was also a crowdfunding campaign and

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,640
this is actually an open source hardware

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,650
solution for a laptop the I don't know

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,210
if they've started shipping them yet but

00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,540
these are the internals this is

00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:48,770
definitely a little more hardcore in

00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:51,790
that you're getting a lot more power out

00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:53,900
of it you're not using a raspberry pi

00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:55,250
then that is actually one of the

00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,740
pictures of prototypes that they were

00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,690
using with all the parts scattered all

00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,860
around um but again do we really want to

00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,150
do things the simple way I think in the

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:06,830
Linux community we like kind of getting

00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,480
our hands dirty getting in way over our

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,250
heads and then realizing oh boy I

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,440
thought I get myself into and then

00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,570
trying to call ourselves out of it so if

00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,590
you want to go at it yourself which I

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:18,320
hope you do because that's why you're

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,489
here there are some points to cover on

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,600
obviously these are the main things

00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,830
you're going to have to look for you

00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,220
need to find a board it's actually gonna

00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:27,290
have your CPU on it your screen keyboard

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,730
mouse touchpad whatever you want to use

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:31,580
your battery in your case we're going to

00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:32,930
step through each one of these board

00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,610
options obviously everybody knows about

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,980
the raspberry pi most people know about

00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,840
the BeagleBone black these are the other

00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,880
main options that I would say are really

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,790
good choices to start if you're looking

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,440
for a solid platform but don't want to

00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,820
actually get into trying to custom

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,800
design your own board because that's

00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,240
let's play beyond me so I'm not even

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,760
attempt that so I'm not going to attempt

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,250
to tell you how to do that personally

00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:57,080
I'm a fan of the o droids the o droid

00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,840
see one in particular is one that I use

00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,120
and i'll be showing later it is at the

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,370
same price point as the Raspberry Pi but

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,280
the CPU is about seventy percent

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,080
stronger and it has a gigabit nic versus

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,040
the 100 megabit Nick on the Raspberry Pi

00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,840
2 um if you're a person who really likes

00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,880
the open source and the freedom

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,800
beaglebone black i have a friend who is

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,120
working on a system right now based on a

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,520
big one black is a great option if

00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,600
you're really looking for some powerful

00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,550
hardware

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,020
omx boards are good I put metal boards

00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:28,550
on here because they'll stand out a

00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,220
little different they're actually x86

00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:33,170
boards so it allows you the option of

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,870
being able to rely on a standard Linux

00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:40,010
distribution and not have to worry about

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:41,030
trying to hunt down arm projects for

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,070
whatever program you're going to use

00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,970
because it's x86 you know the software

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:46,730
is out there because you're using it on

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,310
your desktop again there are other

00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,170
options available I'm not going to go in

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:53,090
and start listing them all out a simple

00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:55,790
Google search for just development

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,030
boards will bring up more options than

00:05:55,790 --> 00:06:00,080
you even think possibly exist you're

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,150
just going to have to spend the time and

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,660
figure out what board is going to work

00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,400
best for you I would recommend you start

00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:09,560
with an idea of what you want to

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,390
accomplish and then look for a board

00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,040
that matches don't just go out there and

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,650
say okay I want the most powerful board

00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,880
because you may not need it again we're

00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:19,130
building a laptop which means you're not

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,440
plugged into the wall so battery power

00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,730
is something to be concerned about so

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,220
you want to get a board that's going to

00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,780
be power efficient and still be able to

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,710
accomplish the tasks that you're going

00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:34,330
to want to accomplish as for the screen

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:37,670
who's heard of eight of fruit okay if

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,960
anyone that has their hands up is anyone

00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:42,080
next to them that is a friend of them

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,630
that doesn't have their hand up okay

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,830
that's good because if you know aveda

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,150
fruit and you haven't told your friends

00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:51,470
about Adafruit they're not your friends

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:55,370
um Adafruit is your best place to source

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:56,900
a screen they have I believe 20 or 30

00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,280
different options for screens all

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,620
different sizes all different

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:03,010
resolutions and the support that you

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:05,960
will get from the Adafruit team is

00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:09,440
unparalleled if you have problems they

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,480
will answer them the information that

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,870
they have the hardware information that

00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,760
they provide freely is from my

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,160
experience unmatched when you're looking

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,440
for this you can find cheaper LCD

00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,610
screens on eBay yes you will good luck

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,320
getting the support from the company

00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:25,460
whose dropshipping it and doesn't know

00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,200
actually a thing about it they're just

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,190
doing a reseller from China because

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,330
they're going to say oh well this is the

00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,560
company that made it here's their

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,400
website and you go to the website and

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,610
it's all in Chinese Adafruit goes

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,900
through and they actually

00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:39,310
they actually test the boards that's why

00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,020
I buy all my stuff I'm not trying to do

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:46,719
a sales pitch form but really this is

00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:48,909
your best option for a screen okay human

00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:50,680
interface device this is a little bit

00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:57,099
tricky and my laptop just decide to shut

00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:59,580
off because you are working on a limited

00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:02,139
form factor you're going to need to get

00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,340
something that's small but yet you're

00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:07,090
still going to be able to like now most

00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,560
people go with a bluetooth keyboard that

00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,729
has a built-in track that an example of

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,539
that let me go back through my screens

00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:15,789
here is that one right there down at the

00:08:13,539 --> 00:08:17,939
bottom it's a small bluetooth keyboard

00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:22,449
with wireless trackpad built-in

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:24,580
all-in-one solution you can do your own

00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:26,580
custom track bed which I have opted to

00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,900
do and I will show pictures that later

00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:32,380
but if you don't want to hassle with it

00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,880
this is the simplest way to go this also

00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,860
means that you're going to have to work

00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,360
bluetooth into your design since a lot

00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,459
of your small development boards do not

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,769
have bluetooth on board now that's not

00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:47,820
usually a problem is your USB dongle but

00:08:41,769 --> 00:08:52,660
that is something to keep in mind okay

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:55,750
okay battery this is going to be the

00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:57,670
issue that is going to be the most

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:04,029
complicated that you're going to have to

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:07,480
deal with yeah most patmos the battery

00:09:04,029 --> 00:09:10,690
packs that you get will be the 18 650

00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,329
lithium-ion cells soldered together with

00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:17,170
an adapter on the end you usually won't

00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:21,699
find them more as a raw pack then about

00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,470
six thousand milligrams now you there

00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:25,930
are probably some people here which have

00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,279
external phone chargers a little battery

00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:29,199
pack that you plug your USB cable in

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,829
ninety percent of those if you actually

00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:35,350
crack them open you use 18 650 cells in

00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,970
them one thing to keep in mind though is

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:38,470
just because the battery pack was

00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,570
labeled as being a 10,000 milliamp

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,380
battery pack does not mean it's a 10,000

00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:45,110
milliamp battery pack

00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:48,500
you can go on to Amazon eBay any of

00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:50,230
those sites as an example and buy a type

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:54,040
of battery called a surefire battery and

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:56,630
they sell surefire batteries that are 65

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,040
6500 milliamp batteries which is really

00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:59,300
interesting because if you call surefire

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,560
they will tell you that the highest

00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:04,550
battery that they make right now is I

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,020
believe 3200 Miller there's an

00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:08,150
unfortunate case where a lot of

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:12,380
batteries are being so overrated to what

00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:14,390
they actually do so when you're looking

00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:15,620
for a battery look for a battery if

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:17,120
you're looking for a battery pack look

00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,770
for a battery pack has been verified for

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:23,600
the actual amount of power that it will

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:26,750
do as an alternative you can use lipo

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,230
cells personally not a fan of them for

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,260
the obvious stated reason if you charge

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,240
them poorly you will start a fire now if

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,260
you're in the woods and you need to

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,400
start a fire and you don't mind

00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:42,530
sacrificing your puter they're a great

00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:44,360
option you can build your own which is

00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:46,840
what I've done now again when you choose

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,130
to go it alone it gets a little hairy

00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,770
the biggest problem you're going to have

00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:53,660
if you design the side to custom build

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:55,640
your own battery pack is actually

00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:58,550
building the charging circuit so that

00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,440
you can balance when you charge I'm not

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,510
going to get into all the electrical

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,620
details of battery packs and balancing

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:05,210
but let's just say it's an extremely

00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,790
complicated thing because you need all

00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,950
the cells to charge to the same rate but

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,570
when you're using a device different

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:13,610
cells will discharge at a different rate

00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,200
and if you're just pumping the same

00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,670
amount of voltage into every single cell

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,740
when you're charging it you're going to

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,910
end up over voltage some cells some

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,500
cells are going to be under vaulted and

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,600
it's going to bring down the efficiency

00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,760
of your over pack and potentially like

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,420
with lipo cells call some very bad heat

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,940
issues you can buy cells which is what I

00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:35,000
opted to do that have an integrated

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,100
protection circuit built into them that

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,230
is what I would recommend you are going

00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,960
to pay about a thirty percent premium on

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:46,010
them but you have the security of not

00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:48,080
having your project you plug into the

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:49,310
wall you go to sleep and then you wake

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,340
up and you're wondering why can't I see

00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,340
anything

00:11:56,970 --> 00:12:02,800
okay case wise you have a couple options

00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,950
for your case you can 3d print your own

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,410
if you don't have a 3d printer in most

00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:10,329
major cities there is a hackerspace or

00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,399
some 3d printing club most the major

00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:13,750
cities have one get in touch with the

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,880
people there tell them what you want to

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:17,019
do usually will be really enthusiastic

00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,149
and actually probably want to help you

00:12:17,019 --> 00:12:20,980
overall in your project also are great

00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:22,029
source of information if you need help

00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,510
with soldering and it's not something

00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:27,370
you're not that skilful on the hardest

00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:31,630
problem with 3d printing it is going to

00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:34,750
be actually building the model itself if

00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:36,370
you do not have experience with CAD you

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:39,910
can work on it I tried and I failed

00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:42,940
horribly I'm actually doing my case out

00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,649
of aluminum sheeting I don't have access

00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,630
to a CNC machine so i actually bought

00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:48,760
aluminum sheeting and i'm cutting it and

00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:50,589
putting it all together i actually have

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,820
the case that I'm working on at the

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:52,990
Jupiter broadcasting booth and if you

00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,540
want you can come by and I can show you

00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,449
that later 3d printing is the best

00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,440
option over something like aluminum or

00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:00,670
metal because obviously it doesn't

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,160
conduct which doesn't mean you don't

00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,660
have to insulate everything it's also

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:11,170
cheaper to actually get something 3d

00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:13,449
printed ah but if you're talking about a

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:17,260
laptop you're probably going to want

00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:18,610
something that's over this big and a lot

00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,949
of your entry-level 3d printers like the

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,360
one I do is 150 millimeter by 150

00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:23,620
millimeter printing bed which means i

00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,550
can print things that are about that big

00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:29,019
150 millers six inches so a small 6-inch

00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:30,370
computer isn't going to be as effective

00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,160
I wanted something that was a little bit

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,870
bigger to use if you're trying to work a

00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,750
keyboard into it you've got to cram all

00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,490
those keys in well with the with the pie

00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,019
top that I showed earlier that's why the

00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,360
person went with that little tiny

00:13:41,019 --> 00:13:45,760
keyboard was because size restrictions

00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,760
there is unfortunately a lack of

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,319
keyboard options in this space most of

00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:52,930
the time the companies that are

00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:54,250
designing small keyboards are either the

00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:57,160
small little bluetooth keyboards for use

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,959
on a phone or a keyboard that you want

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:00,190
to plug into your desktop which is been

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:01,779
inches 12 inches long it's because you

00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,550
don't want to fool them so if you're

00:14:01,779 --> 00:14:04,720
looking for something in that seven to

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:07,199
nine inch range

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,149
you're gonna have some difficulties

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,370
anyway back to the case you can carve

00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:14,259
one out of wood my friend that's doing a

00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:17,439
bone black project that is what he is

00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:19,480
planning on doing he has he's done

00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:21,129
woodworking for a long time so he's

00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,170
gotten some balsa wood and he's just

00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:24,910
going to carve it out exactly to fit

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,209
everything in it so that'll be really

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:30,189
interesting when that's done again cnc

00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:32,050
aluminum if you have a CNC machine you

00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:35,769
are the coolest person ever i want to

00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:38,560
get to know you some hacker spaces have

00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:43,019
them smaller ones it's again it's an

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:45,129
option to check out and acrylic acrylic

00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:47,259
there are places online where you can

00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:49,449
design it and send off your designs and

00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:51,149
they will cut it drill it to all the

00:14:49,449 --> 00:14:53,290
spec that you do and then ship it to you

00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:55,779
again hackerspaces there's usually

00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:59,259
someone around that's involved that has

00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,879
a ability to work with acrylic the one

00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,610
thing to keep in mind with acrylic is it

00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,829
will break so if you want something to

00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:09,750
be kind of able to take take a beating

00:15:05,829 --> 00:15:09,750
acrylic probably isn't your best option

00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,180
ok so my built which is actually sitting

00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,939
in a box right now because it's not done

00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:20,920
I was working on it yesterday in the the

00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:22,209
speaker's room and I was working on a

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,870
little last night and it's still not

00:15:22,209 --> 00:15:28,089
done I accidentally fried my o droid

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:31,420
doing some work on it so it doesn't run

00:15:28,089 --> 00:15:32,740
right now um this was the design the

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,000
form factor that i was going with i

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:36,009
actually have right here does anyone

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,839
remember these old toshiba librettos

00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:40,600
from the mid nineties does anybody

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,000
remember these i absolutely love these

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,329
units they were small they were portable

00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,740
but they fit really well in one hand you

00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:50,290
can walk around with it it fits in your

00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:51,850
hand naturally it's really sturdy I

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:56,620
wouldn't recommend beating it up against

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:58,120
the wall though I've done that um but

00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:00,519
they're really good unit and I like the

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,350
fact that the screen was off centered

00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:03,490
and they built in the mouse and the

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,829
buttons are actually on the back of the

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,629
screen so when you're using it you can

00:16:05,829 --> 00:16:10,660
actually hold it like this in your hand

00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:12,040
and be able to work with your GUI so my

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,279
design I kind of wanted to follow that

00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,600
but trying to find that type of mouse I

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,690
couldn't find so I actually went with

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,770
the trackpad

00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,380
the other thing to keep in mind is

00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,990
thickness nowadays when you buy a modern

00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:28,770
laptop you're looking at somewhere

00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:30,390
between 15 millimeters and about 20

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:35,460
millimeters because then is all the new

00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:38,220
rage I personally don't care for thin my

00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,200
concern is battery life if you're

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,260
building one you're probably not going

00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,850
to get at that thin because you don't

00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:47,190
have the ability to custom design a

00:16:44,850 --> 00:16:49,020
battery send off the designs to China

00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,880
and have them custom make a battery in

00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:52,620
the exact shape and size and thickness

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,110
and everything that you need if you

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,850
decide to go the route of using the 18

00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:03,510
650 cells the cells themselves are I

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,890
believe 17 millimeters in diameter so

00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:06,780
you're automatically going to have that

00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,430
and then imagine how the thickness of

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:10,050
your keyboard sitting on top of that

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:12,240
you're going to be around an inch and a

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:17,910
half just for the bottom it does not

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:20,280
include the top which your screen is now

00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:24,420
I've taken some flack from friends for

00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,070
it being quote unquote thick so I'm

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,070
actually going to defend the thicker

00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:30,210
form factor how many people and i hope

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,660
the hands go up how many people have

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:36,120
books in their house okay that's good if

00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,130
you go home look at your bookshelf look

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:41,610
specifically at the thickness of your

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,890
books they are all between 1 inch and 2

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,360
inch for the majority there are some

00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,190
which are thinner there are so much or

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,440
thicker but the majority of all books

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:52,350
are between 1 and 2 inches the height

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,030
will change the width will change but

00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:58,160
the thickness is pretty much all in that

00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,540
space now I don't know for certain but

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,160
the my friends that work in the

00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:03,960
publishing industry I've asked them why

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,610
that is because it just at for a while

00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,680
it was just curious that books are

00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:09,420
always that size the font size would

00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,860
change the overall dimensions team but

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,110
the thickness was always in that window

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,060
and I never understood why and I asked

00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:16,350
and they asked and eventually the answer

00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,120
that came back from several people which

00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,190
was consistent enough for me to believe

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,680
was that way back in the day when they

00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,910
decided on printing books and they

00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:25,830
wanted it to be effective for people

00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:28,170
obviously people were carrying the books

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,080
if you hold your hand naturally down at

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,210
your side your hand will form a seat

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,850
if you look in there it's about 1 to 2

00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:38,279
inches so something will naturally fit

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,320
in your hand at that size and you don't

00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,580
have to worry about it falling out you

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,720
don't have to worry about squeezing it

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,429
you don't have to worry about trying to

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,090
grip it it's just naturally going to fit

00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:49,710
right there it's a natural feeling um

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,600
with something thicker your hand ends up

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,919
bulging you're going to wear out your

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,149
muscles are going to get tired if you're

00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,190
walking for long distance with it if

00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:58,860
it's thinner you're either going to be

00:18:56,190 --> 00:19:00,899
pinching it or you're going to be trying

00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:02,760
to hold it and do this with it which is

00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:05,190
an unnatural position so if you're going

00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,799
to be carrying it around this gets a

00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:10,260
little painful after a while so for me

00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,880
that form factor I don't have a problem

00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,789
with it now wait is obviously a concern

00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:17,519
but as far as the thickness personally I

00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,590
would rather trade thickness size for

00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,510
ability to run my laptop for a long time

00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:28,950
and you'll understand that later when I

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:30,960
get into it ok here is the choice that I

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:33,210
made this is the Oh droid see one as I

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,220
said um it is at the same price point as

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:39,470
a raspberry pi is a quad-core 1.5

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:45,389
gigahertz ER gigabit nic four USB ports

00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:49,529
or five volts actual moderate usage it's

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:51,750
going to pull about 980 milliamps at 5

00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:52,950
volts max power that it can draw is

00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:55,740
going to be 2 amps it's not going to do

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,240
any more than that this is the screen

00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,809
that I went with I got it from Adafruit

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,740
it is a 7.1 inch screen i believe it is

00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:08,309
1280 by 800 so it is a very high pixel

00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:12,389
density screen at full brightness this

00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:14,039
screen will pull 960 MLMs so it's also

00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:15,090
thankfully a very low-power screen

00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:20,309
compared to the one that's actually in

00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:22,139
my laptop that is the control board now

00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,039
I'm going to stop right here when I said

00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:25,620
you needed to be skilled with a

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,750
soldering gun I meant it because if

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,460
you're worried about the size and the

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,929
thickness of your unit you're going to

00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,289
have to start stripping off components

00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:37,590
off of these boards for instance the RCA

00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:39,870
jack the vga jack oh the power connector

00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,639
all of that I stripped off which means

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,659
actually going in and removing the

00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:43,710
components you just don't want to go in

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,040
there start ripping on because you don't

00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,210
want to damage report

00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:52,690
a lot of boards that you will get with

00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:55,030
your screen panels that actually drive

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,480
the panel are going to be a little thick

00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,640
because they're made to support every

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,170
possible or several possible inputs

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,620
there was one board that i was looking

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:09,160
at which has RCA vga hdmi DVI and

00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:10,720
DisplayPort all along one side well I

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,970
don't need all those options I'm going

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,750
to choose one so I can just strip all

00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:20,920
the other components off and that is the

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:23,260
control board to change brightness

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,040
change screen size refresh rates all

00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,600
that stuff this is the keyboard that I

00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,870
went with I got it from Adafruit it was

00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:33,610
I believe twenty dollars um the reason I

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:34,990
got this was because it was USB I did

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,380
not want to go with the Bluetooth

00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:40,570
solution I wanted to go with a USB so I

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:43,600
could actually hard solder it into or

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,430
onto the Oh droid board itself this is

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,650
the smallest USB keyboard that I have

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:49,330
found I have not found one smaller if

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:54,610
you go any smaller they all seem to go

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:59,560
bluetooth this is the touchpad that I

00:21:54,610 --> 00:22:01,090
got it is also a USB plug in on the back

00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,590
which I didn't include the picture of

00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,230
but I have it at the booth so I can show

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:07,030
you um and it is a touchpad just like

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,430
you would have on your laptop anywhere

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:12,190
else the clicks are actually on the

00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:14,320
backside the way it was designed is that

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,810
there's a little i wish i had the

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,610
picture up there's a little barb on the

00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:20,680
back of it so it actually rocks back and

00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:23,740
forth and the sensors are on the bottom

00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,600
i was actually going to be punching

00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,030
holes to the back side and then actually

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:31,300
just putting in buttons that I could use

00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:33,460
to just directly click through the nice

00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:36,520
thing also about this uh this track pad

00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,730
is the wiring on it is extremely simple

00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,440
in that there is two there's five lines

00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:42,910
two of the lines are vertical two of the

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,060
lines of horizontal so if you just flip

00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,920
them you can change the orientation of

00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:49,510
this board completely so if you want it

00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,790
to be tall or you want to be wide all

00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:54,930
you're doing is changing which solder

00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:54,930
points you're using on the back

00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,550
this is the these the batteries that I

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,710
decided to use now these are panasonic

00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,480
cells that have had the integrated

00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,760
protection circuit built in each one of

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,400
these is thirty-four hundred milliamps

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:12,810
that brings my entire battery capacity

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,430
at right around 60 100 amps now when

00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,590
you're using a board that max is going

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:18,000
to at moderate use is going to pull

00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:19,860
about an amp and you're using a screen

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,800
is going to pull about an amp those

00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,490
batteries will last me my goal is at

00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,110
least 24 hours continuous straight use I

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:31,650
don't know if I'm going to hit it I have

00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:34,230
a friend who is using a raspberry pi and

00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:38,550
that's lower lower power usage who built

00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:41,580
a it was a mid mid 30s amp battery pack

00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:45,240
and they got up to about 18 hours

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:47,130
straight use um but it's a lower power

00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:49,620
draw my board uses a little bit more

00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,880
power and I'm doubling the amount so

00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:54,300
hopefully I can hit the 24 hour mark

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,160
that's kind of my goal um charging is

00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,990
also as I said is going to be the fun

00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,140
part I found these and I have the links

00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:03,120
um that I can give everybody these are a

00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,650
boat that was made by a company called

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,970
power stream it's an open source design

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,320
or you can just buy it directly from

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:09,720
them i think it was ten dollars so it

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,720
was a deal for me and i got to in case

00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:15,390
I'm s1 up so I have spare parts each of

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,740
these USBs will push two amps out a lot

00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:19,980
of the chargers that you'll get will

00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,110
push two amps on 11 amp on another I

00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,180
wanted to go with one that did two amps

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:28,130
on both so I had the capability to pull

00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,420
the extra amperage if I needed it um

00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,800
these are custom and that you buy the

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,000
cells you can buy them directly from

00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,830
them you can buy cells from anybody else

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,750
oh they don't care you simply wire up

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,010
your pack and then you solder in your

00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,440
positive and negative leading your go

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,230
this has the integrated charging circuit

00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,310
built into it it will only charge at 500

00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:47,280
milliamps though that's kind of the

00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:48,990
downside so I'm not looking forward to

00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,280
when I if I actually run my laptop for a

00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:55,500
whole day straight and then I have to

00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:58,160
charge up a 61 amp battery somebody

00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,160
didn't turn off his phone

00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:03,580
charging a 61 amp hour battery on a 500

00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,250
milliamps our jury is not going to be

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:10,510
fun but that's kind of my own fault so

00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:12,670
I'm just gonna have to deal with it this

00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:13,840
was a simple mock-up that I did for how

00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:16,920
I wouldn't fit it again you can see me

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,910
using the liberato as my size base

00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,040
there's where the battery packs going

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:25,390
and then having all the boards and

00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:27,040
everything on the side against then I'm

00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,690
going for power use I wanted to cram as

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:32,470
much battery in there as I could if

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,910
you're not worried about long life you

00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:35,559
can move things around to make it easier

00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:37,660
to work on once this unit gets together

00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:40,510
I'm probably not going to take it apart

00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:41,830
unless I break it again which will

00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,600
probably happen so I will have to take

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:46,410
it apart and then curse myself the fact

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:50,950
that I didn't make it easier to work on

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:53,860
now for the keyboard and the touchpad as

00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,660
i said i'm using USB but i want to keep

00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:57,190
things small and i don't want to have to

00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:58,540
deal with the entire USB connector so i

00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:01,059
thought well this is easy I'll just

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,929
straight solder the USB lines directly

00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,160
onto the motherboard they're going to

00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,600
connect any way through a connector I

00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:08,370
can strip out the connector and save

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,370
myself a good inch from the plug

00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:13,919
unfortunately these USB why I don't even

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,140
know what you would want to call them

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,010
the metal shielding is very difficult to

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,679
get off at least I found it

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:23,049
extraordinarily difficult to get off I

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,700
have a hot air rework station which

00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:26,169
basically is just a machine that heats

00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,940
up air and blows it out and you can

00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:30,669
choose the rate and it went up I goes up

00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:32,890
to 400 degrees Fahrenheit and i still

00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:34,960
had problems using that getting enough

00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,580
heat to melt the solder joints to be

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,929
able to pull the shielding off but

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:41,230
thankfully I was able to manage it just

00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:42,520
took a while does anybody I'll stop it

00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:46,750
has anyone used a hot air rework station

00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:48,880
before okay for those that haven't like

00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:50,440
I said it's a box that heats up air and

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,270
puts it to a tube and you just pointed

00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,730
at it you have to be a little careful

00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:57,160
with them because like mine does up to

00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,830
450 so you need to limit the amount of

00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,090
heat you're putting on to your board to

00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:02,020
remove the component you want to remove

00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:05,710
it because you don't want to cook your

00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,880
whole board um I I'm new with the hot

00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,559
air rework station so I don't have much

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,000
experience with it but I have heard from

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,240
other friends that they have damaged

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,850
other components

00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:16,220
by overheating the board trying to get a

00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:18,020
component off so that is something to be

00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,730
concerned with again YouTube is going to

00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,920
be your friend there are videos up on

00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,570
how to use them higher rubric stations

00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:29,570
aren't that much i think i got mine for

00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:31,550
forty dollars the GPIO pins had to be

00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,580
sacrificed gpio i wasn't going to be

00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,170
using them anyway so i didn't care um

00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:37,670
thankfully Jason plum is not in here

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:39,200
you'll probably horrify that I destroyed

00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:40,520
one of his precious our boards this

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,040
wasn't his personally but it's still one

00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:46,010
that he likes the reason I did this was

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:49,160
so i could get the vga the LCD panel

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:53,420
driver board down closer to the oh joy

00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,500
for saving space I could have D soldered

00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,390
all those but that was just more work

00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,860
than I wanted to mess with here is the

00:27:56,390 --> 00:28:01,490
charging circuit again stripped off the

00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:06,020
shielding there's the raw pins and here

00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:08,480
is the power linked in with the LCD

00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:11,980
driver and the O droid as you can see I

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,820
pulled off the vga plug and the RCA

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,120
because I didn't need them and they were

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:18,740
in the way um one thing I will note you

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,750
can see on the ends if you look at okay

00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:22,040
we got three boards will go from right

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,660
to left we have blue then we have the

00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,400
that's the oh joy then going to the

00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:27,710
right one that's the LCD panel if you

00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:29,600
look at the O droid and at the LCD

00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:31,360
you'll see where I actually have a wired

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,320
in you'll see little black strips that

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,809
where the cover up to lead you can see

00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:39,559
it most on the REDD+ leads on that is

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:40,970
heat shrink has anyone ever used hot air

00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:43,580
heat shrink before okay for those that

00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,830
haven't you need to get some because

00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,090
this will protect you from crossing your

00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,160
lines and shorting things out basically

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,510
it's just a tube you cut I don't

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,540
actually know what material I don't some

00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:54,890
type of plastic or paper or whatever uh

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:56,360
you slide it over you saw your

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,890
connection or whatever you started your

00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:01,130
joint you can use it between wires

00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:03,260
connectors and wires you slide the heat

00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,880
shrink back over it and you just apply

00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,679
heat to it and it does exactly what the

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,480
word does it shrinks down and actually

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,610
surrounds it and covers up your actual

00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,500
solder joint this way you don't have to

00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:16,750
worry about making a connection that you

00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,750
don't want to and shorting out your unit

00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:21,419
this is the keyboard I stripped it out

00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:23,190
of the case saved myself a good bit of

00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:24,809
space actually I believed when it was in

00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:26,759
the case the total size was about 18

00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:28,169
millimeters thick once I stripped it

00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,659
down and took it out of the plastic case

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:34,169
it was 11 so I saved myself some good

00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:35,700
space there and again since I'm doing my

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:38,820
own wiring I didn't need the long cable

00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:40,529
on the plug so I directly wired in the

00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,989
wires now there's a point here which I'm

00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:44,879
going to touch on later but I'm gonna

00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:47,039
say it now so if I forget it at the end

00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:48,869
someone please remind me save everything

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:54,809
you cut off of a board because you might

00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:56,369
need it ok this is the back side of the

00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:58,349
track pad that's the stock connector

00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:00,450
which I didn't want so I just pulled the

00:29:58,349 --> 00:30:03,389
pins out and redid them and like I said

00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,669
the brown and the green if you switch

00:30:03,389 --> 00:30:09,059
them for the red and the yellow it just

00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:11,039
simply inverts the X and Y axis if you

00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:12,929
then invert the red and yellow just

00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:16,229
themselves you will change which side

00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:18,090
it's going so if you want to do one like

00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:19,559
on mine the trackpad will be on the

00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,149
inside if you wanted to put it on the

00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:24,720
outside you're going to need to change

00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:27,259
the dimensions of the axis because it's

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,720
going to be backwards from which sides

00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:33,809
ok so all you're doing with this one is

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,840
you're simply just switching which wires

00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:39,419
which wire I got that online for I

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,090
believe it was $35 the company is cirque

00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:44,129
I do not believe they sell to

00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:46,769
individuals so you will have to find a

00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:48,599
reseller I'm and as you can see right

00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:52,970
there down at the bottom are the actual

00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:55,470
switches themselves little plugs and

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:56,909
there's my initial horrible soldering

00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,679
job which I did because it was late one

00:30:56,909 --> 00:31:00,119
night and I just wanted to get done and

00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,739
then I woke up the next morning I looked

00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,599
at it and said that's horrible so i

00:31:01,739 --> 00:31:05,190
redid it but i don't have a picture of

00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,330
my better soldering job and actually I

00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,379
broke one of the cables last night when

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,249
I was working on it so I got to redo it

00:31:07,379 --> 00:31:16,320
again and here is the keyboard touchpad

00:31:11,249 --> 00:31:18,599
battery and everything all wired up ok

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,169
things to consider like I said soldering

00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:25,289
skills um yeah we'll get to the hole

00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:28,019
gets the china part later uh it's not

00:31:25,289 --> 00:31:29,309
difficult but like anything you're going

00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:32,519
to want to do some practice before you

00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:35,159
jump into something of this nature

00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:36,629
ahh like everything you don't start an

00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:37,950
immensely go I'm going to be a fantastic

00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:39,719
chef I'm just going to go into the

00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:41,009
kitchen start sewing stuff in a pan and

00:31:39,719 --> 00:31:42,119
I'm gonna make a wonderful meal no you

00:31:41,009 --> 00:31:44,639
got to work at it you gotta do a little

00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:46,409
research and do some practice like

00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:47,489
everything soldering is not hard just

00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,799
takes a little bit practice an

00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:51,929
experience okay standards who has heard

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:53,789
of standards USB standards just

00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:55,320
standards in general okay most of us

00:31:53,789 --> 00:32:00,119
have standards are a great thing we all

00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:02,309
like standards who's heard of China okay

00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,419
who has heard of the lack of standards

00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:06,809
coming out of China when they decide to

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:09,869
make a board okay my example on this is

00:32:06,809 --> 00:32:17,549
the I forget what it was it was another

00:32:09,869 --> 00:32:22,619
system that i was using arm oh you okay

00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:25,079
USB the wiring is red red white green

00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:27,179
black in that order that's what the

00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:29,279
standard says there was one that I got

00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:31,079
it was a there's a keyboard for another

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,820
project I was helping a friend with we

00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,229
stripped the ends off we're ok we're

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:36,479
going to solder it up we look at the

00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:41,039
wires and it's orange blue yellow and

00:32:36,479 --> 00:32:42,709
purple and what hold on a second what is

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,849
this well these colors aren't even right

00:32:42,709 --> 00:32:48,809
the problem was we has already stripped

00:32:44,849 --> 00:32:49,950
it off and cut the other end off too so

00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:51,479
then we're like crap we don't know

00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:53,940
actually which pin goes to which pin

00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:56,759
because we can logically think well it

00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,709
should be simple order 1 2 3 4 0 1 n 1 2

00:32:56,759 --> 00:33:01,559
3 up on the other end but that would

00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:02,820
make sense so we had to rummage through

00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,769
the trash for about half an hour so we

00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,669
actually found the plug stripped it out

00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:06,959
and then actually found that actually

00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:11,700
they did switch the wires around on the

00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:15,839
other end so save everything because you

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:20,070
might need it um I also would recommend

00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:22,409
that if you can use your own wiring on

00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:24,529
components do not trust the wiring that

00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:31,019
you're going to get if you're buying

00:33:24,529 --> 00:33:35,339
inexpensive components the the cabling

00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:36,509
that came with the trackpad looked

00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:38,099
pretty good when you looked at it and

00:33:36,509 --> 00:33:39,899
you saw the amount of insulation on it

00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:42,059
when you actually would strip it out I

00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:43,589
swear it was 40 gauge wire now if

00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:45,299
anybody understands the gauge system

00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:46,179
with wire you understand that 40 gauge

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,360
is Bay

00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:51,210
simply non-existent um went to touch it

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,889
with solder and where'd my wire go

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:55,210
that's why initially I actually used the

00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:56,289
actual metal plugs that were still on

00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,210
the end because I was trusting that

00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:01,419
their solder would hold and it didn't

00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:03,940
really hold that well um so feel free to

00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:05,350
run your own wiring because you don't

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,659
know the quality of the components

00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:11,309
you're getting and if it is like a

00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:14,169
laughing's there is a severe push with

00:34:11,309 --> 00:34:15,760
low cost of manufacturing they want to

00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:17,260
be able to push out 10 million units of

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,270
something for the lowest possible cost

00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,740
and they're not really worried about the

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:22,480
end consumer because they're not selling

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,909
to the end consumer they're selling to a

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,950
resale er once that retailer has that

00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,659
project product they don't care anymore

00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:32,349
they've made their money it's their

00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:34,510
problem um so you're going to have

00:34:32,349 --> 00:34:35,740
you're going to run into issues where

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:37,690
you're going to look at something

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:41,200
anything why on earth would someone put

00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:43,089
this super super thin wire in it that I

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,409
can't do anything with because they

00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:51,629
didn't ever want you to be able to do

00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:53,740
anything with it ok these are my

00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:56,200
components that I use there's the links

00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:59,710
i will have all these up on my personal

00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:03,130
website which by the way is q5 sis sys

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:03,970
dot sh and if you want you can come by

00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:06,069
the booth and i'll give you the address

00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:09,460
again if you want to see all the

00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:12,460
different parts that I got um for my

00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:13,450
build ok so I wanted to leave plenty of

00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,420
space because I'm sure there's people

00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,829
questions that people have um so I'm

00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:23,980
going to kind of open the floor up and

00:35:17,829 --> 00:35:27,010
if we have questions okay okay the

00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:31,059
question was can you ever try to carry

00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:32,530
one of these through ta and I'm I'm

00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:36,190
gonna play the the the grammar teacher

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:38,589
joke you can try you can should you i

00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,790
would highly recommend it now if you get

00:35:38,589 --> 00:35:41,770
a finished product that's really nice

00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,180
and polished like if you have if you go

00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,230
with the pie top I don't think you're

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:47,530
gonna have a much of an issue with that

00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:48,520
if you go for the the little one which

00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,470
is a little handheld when you're

00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,230
probably not going to have a problem if

00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,349
you're finished product looks somewhat

00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:59,660
legit you're going to be okay if you try

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:02,340
to go through the TSA yeah

00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:03,660
what they don't know if you try to like

00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,520
throw this in your bag and go through

00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:07,230
the TSA your bags not going to make it

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:17,010
you might make it but that's going to be

00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:27,020
coming out yeah good old TSA okay any

00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:27,020
other questions anybody has say again I

00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:42,360
don't know what you mean by found

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:43,890
objects okay the question was um have

00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:46,260
people ever use something that they have

00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:48,900
that they like as the basis for the

00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,640
laptop like a cigar box or whatever I'm

00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,400
sure that there are people that have I

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,280
don't know of any personally um that's

00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,110
more of something that the mini ITX

00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,990
community has really really been big on

00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:02,550
and I hope it transfers into what I hope

00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:03,810
will be a small burgeoning community of

00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,710
people that want to design their laptops

00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:09,600
um in using something that you like for

00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:11,160
actually building your own system I had

00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,320
actually for a while thought about

00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:15,270
taking one of these stripping all the

00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,860
parts out and just using this actual

00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,850
case because it's already made and I

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,890
don't have to figure out how to design

00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:21,150
one myself and then I got the

00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:22,890
screwdriver in my hand and I looked at

00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,270
it and I felt really sad and I was like

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:26,340
no I can't do that because it's going to

00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:29,100
hate me and these are so hard to come by

00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,810
in their actual put together form that I

00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:31,770
just did if I can ever find someone that

00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:33,000
has a load of these and they're just

00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:36,900
gonna throw him away then I will

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,820
probably do that um there was it's kind

00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,350
of a joke someone did years to go online

00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,610
where somebody tried to sell a macbook

00:37:40,350 --> 00:37:43,020
online and it ended up to be a fraud

00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:44,880
thing and I figured it out and actually

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,410
took a three ring binder and made a fake

00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,410
laptop inside a three-ring binder and

00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:51,180
mailed it to the person um you can have

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:54,780
fun you can be creative with it but

00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,670
again it think about what you won don't

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,160
use it for and where you're going to go

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,420
with it if like was brought up if you're

00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:03,060
planning on taking this and going

00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,350
through the TSA to fly just with inside

00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,960
the country or god forbid you're trying

00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:09,540
to take it outside the country uh what

00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,520
it looks like is going to matter because

00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,040
they don't understand in most cases

00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,450
that it may look scary but it isn't

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,960
scary because all they're concerned with

00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:26,980
is the perception any other questions

00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:29,350
one in the back back there green iron do

00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:34,480
you recommend okay type of soldering

00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:49,390
iron that i recommend there is deep that

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:51,370
is exactly what I was going to say yeah

00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:52,510
to reiterate what the gentleman the

00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,180
audience said if you're looking for a

00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:59,230
good soldering gun jaco is the way to go

00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:02,350
that's actually what I have arm it's a

00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,180
JK k oh I'm actually Adafruit sells one

00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:06,460
if you want I think it's a hundred and

00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:08,380
ten dollars on that is probably the best

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,260
soldering and I have ever used I had an

00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:12,880
older Weller precision soldering gun and

00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,010
it worked really well but once I got the

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,610
hakko it was like wow I've been using

00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:19,810
something that's really not that good

00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:22,570
the key point is you're going to want to

00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,650
get one that has a precision tip some of

00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,910
you have probably seen the soldering

00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:27,220
guns that are actually shaped like a gun

00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:28,540
and have the two leads that come out and

00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,790
then connect at the end has anybody seen

00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:33,010
those okay those are not what you want

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,200
to use not what you want to use you will

00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,790
melt everything all of your board you

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,600
will get one that it will look like the

00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:42,040
end of a needle at the end arm jaco is

00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,450
the best is the best option i can give

00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:47,710
you are there any other questions

00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,570
thoughts concerned one back over here

00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:57,760
hold on we got a mic coming that way

00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:59,530
everybody can hear you that's just a

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,500
short question what was the total cost

00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:04,930
of your build oh um you really don't

00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,250
wanna know Oh which is a good point in

00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,870
that cooler is not an nine dollars a

00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,300
person hours the question was what is

00:40:07,870 --> 00:40:11,350
the total cost of my build um and thank

00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,460
you for bringing it up because I did

00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,620
that was something I want to bring up

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,880
and I forgot do not think this is going

00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,700
to be a budget way to build yourself a

00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,800
laptop on the go don't it's not my

00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:22,630
batteries alone cost me two hundred

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,370
forty dollars that's just the batteries

00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:29,570
um the o droid itself was

00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:31,660
35 um see the screen was a hundred and

00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:36,170
ten that comes with a control board uh

00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:38,450
the keyboard was 24 15 to 20 the

00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,180
trackpad was 35 it adds up real quick

00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:42,260
plus there's all the accessories that

00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,310
you're not thinking of for instance if

00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,720
you're going to run your own wiring when

00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:46,220
I got to go up by the wiring doesn't

00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:48,530
cost much but it's an added cost if

00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,510
you're going to do a case okay if you're

00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,920
going to do acrylic you're going to have

00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,420
the case cost if you're shipping the

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,390
design out to get someone else to print

00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,730
it I have no clue what that cost if your

00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:00,350
3d printing yourself you're just buying

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,570
the filament and using however much you

00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:04,550
need to get your design right if you're

00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:06,680
using a 3d printing service where you

00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:08,150
send them the STL files you're gonna

00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,040
have to look at what their costs are as

00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:14,360
far as my total cost of what I've

00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,010
actually put into it I would guesstimate

00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,680
somewhere around four to five hundred

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:19,640
dollars right now um for four to five

00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:22,670
hundred dollars i could have gotten a

00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,110
much powerful retail laptop but it

00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:26,540
doesn't have the cool factor saying I

00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:27,680
built that of course it's also probably

00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:32,150
gonna be a whole lot less reliable

00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,430
because I built that we have a in the

00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:35,960
back oh one of the other things that you

00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,630
should take into consideration is that

00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,450
you built a laptop with literally three

00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,940
times the battery capacity of a standard

00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:46,550
laptop yes then that yeah this is the

00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:47,780
gentleman was saying um you know I built

00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,910
it with three times the capacity that

00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:51,950
was my design impetus that was the

00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:54,320
reason I wanted to do this because I

00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:58,280
spend most of my day away from power

00:41:54,320 --> 00:42:00,620
outlets so I need a laptop or a system

00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:02,540
that I can use that's going to last I

00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:05,000
have a charger that I can plug into my

00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,170
car but that's only going to give me 30

00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:08,180
minutes of juice when I'm driving from

00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:12,410
point A to point B and then I'm back out

00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:14,390
of my car again so yeah the cost for me

00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:16,520
it's acceptable obviously that's why I

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:17,930
did it um and it's kind of a hobby I

00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,090
mean I think a lot of us spend money on

00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:21,500
things that are hobbies that we're not

00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:23,270
really concerned cost may be more than

00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:25,790
if we did it another way because we're

00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:30,170
enjoying the whole process other

00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:35,330
questions hold on one sec oh no I got

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:37,329
one we got a microphone coming you don't

00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,329
have any disk storage in your lap

00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:43,719
that you mentioned oh thank you the ODE

00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:45,160
roids use they can use for for for the

00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:47,019
OS they can use an SD card like a

00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:51,400
raspberry pi or they also use what's

00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:54,579
called an emmc module arm which I i do

00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,650
have listed here it's a 16 gig emmc

00:42:54,579 --> 00:42:59,019
module it's basically like an SSD but

00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:00,609
for these your right speed read/write

00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:03,700
speeds around 150 megabytes a second um

00:43:00,609 --> 00:43:05,349
so a whole lot faster then using just a

00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,660
simple SD card so I have the entire OS

00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:09,819
loaded on that I don't have any external

00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:12,400
storage or internal storage beyond that

00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:22,630
I still have if I can get to it real

00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:24,539
quick arm on the droid yeah let them

00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:29,680
switch the switch thing over real quick

00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:31,359
I still have two of the USB ports on

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,150
there so I can still plug in an external

00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:39,130
drive at that point USB flash drive

00:43:34,150 --> 00:43:40,690
whatever okay there's another question

00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:53,619
about hold on one moment we have the mic

00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:57,699
coming around and I see your hands 0 1

00:43:53,619 --> 00:44:01,420
what were your plans ooh for when you

00:43:57,699 --> 00:44:05,549
originally it when you first had the

00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:10,029
idea what were your plans for the laptop

00:44:05,549 --> 00:44:13,420
what like what exactly where you're

00:44:10,029 --> 00:44:14,739
going for when you built it okay the

00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,140
question was what were my original plans

00:44:14,739 --> 00:44:19,539
when I design my original plans were

00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:21,910
something about this size that would

00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:25,029
last me all day long um it's convenient

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:28,089
it's small it's portable it fits in my

00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:31,569
pants pocket um it's nice and useful and

00:44:28,089 --> 00:44:35,039
again battery life was my main thing we

00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:35,039
had a question over here

00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:43,459
going back to the battery life it looked

00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:45,439
like you are drawing much more power

00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:47,719
than what's coming in from your charger

00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:51,709
so when are you touching it and how long

00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:53,689
okay I when I was building the unit I

00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:55,549
got about ninety percent of it done and

00:44:53,689 --> 00:44:57,739
then I burnt out my old road I cooked it

00:44:55,549 --> 00:45:00,289
so I haven't actually been able to run

00:44:57,739 --> 00:45:01,279
the thing continuously to see how long

00:45:00,289 --> 00:45:03,949
it can actually last that's why i said

00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:06,049
my target is 24 hours am i going to

00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:08,809
reach it I believe I will but I don't

00:45:06,049 --> 00:45:11,719
know um the other thing to mention with

00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:13,130
this charger is on chargers that will

00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:14,959
pull power that you can buy like this

00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,989
one for battery packs your efficiency

00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:19,759
goes down hill very fast when you're

00:45:17,989 --> 00:45:21,229
pulling power from it and you're trying

00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:23,839
to charge from it at the same time I

00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:25,669
don't recommend it whatsoever on a

00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:27,589
regular laptop the charging systems are

00:45:25,669 --> 00:45:29,809
designed so you can be using your system

00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:30,559
full power have the charger in and

00:45:29,809 --> 00:45:32,719
you're still going to charge your

00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:34,549
batteries on a lot of your custom packs

00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,609
or even like the phone charger packs

00:45:34,549 --> 00:45:39,619
that you get trying to charge the pack

00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:41,900
itself while you're pulling current from

00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:46,099
it to use your device your efficiency

00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:48,709
tanks out completely um I believe the

00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:50,419
one charger i was looking at before was

00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:53,029
rated at actually eighty percent in

00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:55,579
efficiency if you're trying to charge it

00:45:53,029 --> 00:45:58,599
and pull at the same time so it's why

00:45:55,579 --> 00:46:02,299
even try but my charging time will

00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,769
probably be longer than my actual how

00:46:02,299 --> 00:46:06,380
long i can use it once it's actually

00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:09,199
charged but at this point i I don't know

00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:12,049
length hopefully next year I'll have it

00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:13,579
everything done by then and I won't have

00:46:12,049 --> 00:46:16,130
bought three more boards because I

00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:17,900
messed them up and then I can start to

00:46:16,130 --> 00:46:19,519
thing friday when self starts and we can

00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,309
just let the thing run continuously and

00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:28,339
see when it dies another question of

00:46:22,309 --> 00:46:30,769
here I need to know with your charging

00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:34,130
board is does that have feedback back to

00:46:30,769 --> 00:46:36,919
your actual Oh droid to tell you if it's

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:40,519
charging and held by how much okay the

00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:42,140
board yes on the board if you look right

00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:43,939
here is in the center on the top there's

00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:46,039
that arm that kind of shoots out at the

00:46:43,939 --> 00:46:50,809
top there are actually LEDs on that arm

00:46:46,039 --> 00:46:52,610
and that will give you a rating as far

00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:54,650
as if your package charge

00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:56,210
how accurate is it I'm not entirely sure

00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,130
it may say it's fully charged when it's

00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:59,690
only eighty percent charged because all

00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:00,830
that is doing is simply detecting how

00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:02,120
much current it's putting into the

00:47:00,830 --> 00:47:06,290
batteries versus how much is actually

00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:12,770
coming back another question right back

00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:16,130
there in the back what would you

00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:18,200
recommend for for what method would you

00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:20,360
recommend for dealing with potential

00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:22,730
shock issues like let's say you had in

00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:24,950
your backpack knock up your backpack off

00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:27,140
your chair and it hits the ground how do

00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:30,890
you keep it from turning into a nice

00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:33,410
expensive paperweight um personally what

00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:35,390
I'm doing is since I have a 3d printer

00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,520
i'm using a filament called ninja flex

00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:39,260
which basically acts like rubber once

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,660
you print it and i'm actually printing

00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,830
up flat pads i have some at the Jupiter

00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:44,180
broadcasting booth but I can show you

00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:46,430
which I'm actually going to be lining

00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:49,190
the individual components with so there

00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,450
is some type of shock absorption um most

00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:52,760
laptops actually don't have shock

00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,960
absorption built into them if you strip

00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,520
down the case you'll see that the case

00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:57,050
is pretty much as hard plastic or metal

00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,700
or whatever it's made of and no

00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:00,590
consideration is given to if you drop it

00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,840
down the stairwell because you shouldn't

00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:04,730
be dropping it down the stairwell um

00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:06,620
when you do it's the oh I hope that

00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:08,210
lasted but that's not really something

00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:10,850
even on the commercial scale that

00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,140
they're really that concerned with I I

00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,520
went with it just because I know

00:48:12,140 --> 00:48:14,840
sometimes I'm clumsy and I stick

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,010
something my pocket and I'm driving down

00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,870
the road and then I get out I don't

00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:21,380
think that it slid a little and poops

00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:23,420
there it goes um so you can do that it

00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:25,130
that's also going to depend on what

00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,920
you're actually using to build your case

00:48:25,130 --> 00:48:30,170
um if you're building it out of aluminum

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,270
you're probably not going to have to

00:48:30,170 --> 00:48:33,980
worry about the shock value as much

00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:37,670
because your board is going to be locked

00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:38,960
on very well so as long as you can if

00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:40,490
you're using something like a luma cnc

00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,560
aluminum or whatever as long as you can

00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,780
see computer that secure your components

00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,790
to the board securely you should be okay

00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,910
as long as you insulate them from each

00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:55,550
other and we have another question right

00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:58,190
here wife I don't have it again i have

00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:01,250
2s USB ports the question was if i have

00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:03,380
Wi-Fi answer is no with the two USB

00:49:01,250 --> 00:49:05,360
ports i have the capability of just

00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:06,230
taking a USB Wi-Fi dongle and slapping

00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,720
it in

00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:10,609
which also reminds me about audio

00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,250
different microbe or development boards

00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:15,710
have different things with audio um the

00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:18,109
o droid see one actually does audio out

00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:20,810
of the hdmi so that's not really going

00:49:18,109 --> 00:49:24,380
to work for me so what I had to do is

00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:26,570
actually buy a small USB audio dongle

00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,830
which i'm just going to strip out of the

00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:29,900
case and then take the role plugs and

00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:30,980
put them into the side somehow so that i

00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:35,780
can then just hook in a set of

00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:37,820
headphones with any other quote i I

00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:40,580
don't know if I'll it i think i listed

00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:41,780
that in the in the notes as far as the

00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,790
parts if not if you want to know about

00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:45,380
the USB thing um you can get them

00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:46,790
anywhere mine is actually on a cable so

00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:48,320
it flexes which is real nice because

00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:52,070
then i can wire the cable however I need

00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:58,520
to UM I have that at the booth and I can

00:49:52,070 --> 00:50:04,310
show you yeah I did USB audio any other

00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:08,390
questions one over here on the side well

00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:10,040
it's not completed yet um let me put it

00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,930
this way it's lighter than my thinkpad

00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:15,200
with all the components kind of mashed

00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:17,380
together and picked up it's i would say

00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,690
probably about 75% the weight of this um

00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:24,290
it is of course size-wise that weight is

00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:26,450
more densely packed arm so hopefully

00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:28,460
hopefully it won't it won't be that bad

00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:30,590
with the way that I laid out the

00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:32,090
batteries inside the case since they're

00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:33,590
all flat and all next to each other I'm

00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:34,790
hoping that the way it's going to be

00:50:33,590 --> 00:50:36,560
balanced enough that it's not going to

00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:38,720
feel weird like one side is weighted a

00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:40,880
little heavier than the other that's one

00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,130
of those things that you know the best

00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,890
laid plans of men let's let's hope it

00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:51,140
works out the way I hope any other

00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:52,190
question in other ones right here what

00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:55,250
are you going to use this thing forward

00:50:52,190 --> 00:50:57,650
you have a purpose for it ah just play

00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:58,670
with it well the question was what is my

00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:00,170
purpose for this what am I going to use

00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:03,410
it for I guess the same thing I would

00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:05,930
use a laptop for arm the biggest

00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:08,359
problem like i said that i have is power

00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:09,830
consumption and longevity of a bat like

00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:12,200
this thinkpad I have a stack of

00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:13,310
batteries at my house so if I'm so more

00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,680
my battery gets low I can pop it out

00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:18,530
slap anyone in a lot of the computing

00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,180
that I do on the go with different

00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:22,609
clients and stuff because I did security

00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,569
salting sometimes I need to bring my

00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:25,369
whole rig because i'm actually doing

00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:27,440
work and other times i'm talking to

00:51:25,369 --> 00:51:29,480
clients educating clients doing things

00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:31,490
like that and i don't need a real

00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,890
powerhouse I just need to be able to get

00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:35,750
online through a land port pull down

00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:38,599
information write some simple document

00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:42,020
simple email stuff like that so my use

00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,000
case isn't that much of serious

00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:48,290
computing now obviously you can build

00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:50,180
one for that purpose um there's a person

00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:51,440
I talked to at linux fest northwest who

00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,040
was thinking about getting a middle

00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,500
board and actually building a custom

00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:59,420
penetration laptop around that with all

00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,980
the different wireless antennas zigbee

00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:05,780
bluetooth you know Wi-Fi all those so

00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:09,619
because you're building it you can build

00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:11,329
it to whatever you want to accomplish if

00:52:09,619 --> 00:52:13,670
you want it to just be a simple use easy

00:52:11,329 --> 00:52:15,470
to use you can do that if you want to

00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:21,160
build something that's purpose focused

00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:23,930
you can do that too any other questions

00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:26,290
ok thank you for coming i hope you

00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,290
enjoyed it

00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:11,360
you

00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:54,450
your customers rely on your website or

00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:56,790
application if it's slower

00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:59,730
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:01,559
and costs you money keeping your

00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:04,760
business critical systems humming along

00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:07,380

00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:09,329
your system metrics tells stories

00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:11,369
stories that can reveal performance

00:54:09,329 --> 00:54:13,740
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:15,359
other problems but how do you keep an

00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:18,089
eye on all of your systems performance

00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,910
metrics in real-time and record this

00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:22,920
data for later analysis enter longview

bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:53,569
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:55,309
load and network usage click a specific

00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:57,710
system to access its individual

00:55:55,309 --> 00:56:00,250
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:55:57,710 --> 00:56:02,630
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:04,309
comprehensive network data including

00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:06,619
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:56:04,309 --> 00:56:08,210
available on the network tab and disk

00:56:06,619 --> 00:56:10,099
rights and free space on the disk

00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:12,950
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:15,500
displays usage statistics for individual

00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:17,690
processes the system info tab shows

00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:19,910
listening services active connections

00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:22,039
and available updates adding long view

00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,750
to a system is easy just click the

00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:25,880
button copy the one line installation

00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:28,309
command then run the command on your

00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,019
linux system to complete the process the

00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:32,210
agent will begin collecting data and

00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:35,720
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:37,970
start rolling use long view to gain

00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:42,700
visibility into your servers so when

00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:42,700
your website or app heats up it stays up

00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:25,440
you

00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:43,060
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:45,849
you need to integrate manage and

00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:48,010
automate a virtual data center all on an

00:58:45,849 --> 00:58:50,410
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:53,140
platform and at a third of the cost of

00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:54,880
other solutions but why even bother with

00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:57,010
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,990
in the first place well let's say you

00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:01,300
have a traditional one server to one

00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:03,280
application architecture but you're

00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:05,830
running out of resources and performance

00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:08,160
is suffering once you order new server

00:59:05,830 --> 00:59:11,020
hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:13,900
configure it install your business

00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:16,690
application stage and test the server

00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:18,880
and finally add it to your production

00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:21,070
farm if you've been through this process

00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:23,589
before you know it can take weeks or

00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:25,450
even months you also know it's a

00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:27,400
manually intensive process that will

00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:30,730
burden your team every time you outgrow

00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:32,500
your current setup with a virtual server

00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:35,290
solution you could accomplish all of

00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:37,839
that in less than half a day server

00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:39,670
virtualization software separates the OS

00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:42,099
and application from the underlying

00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:44,260
server hardware and with multiple

00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:45,970
virtual machines on a single server you

00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:48,940
can use each of them to run different

00:59:45,970 --> 00:59:50,710
os's and applications this makes it

00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:52,480
possible to move your virtual machines

00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:54,550
from one piece of hardware to another

00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,830
whenever you want to maximize

00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:58,810
utilization simplify maintenance or

00:59:56,830 --> 01:00:01,119
recover from a hardware failure and

00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:04,450
without slowing down your applications

01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,119
or users clearly server virtualization

01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:10,119
provides big benefits and Citrix

01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:12,339
XenServer provides even more since it's

01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,200
built on an open platform xenserver

01:00:12,339 --> 01:00:15,680
plays well with your existing hardware

01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:18,079
storage systems

01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,430
and IT management software as well as

01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,280

01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,020
your system metrics tell stories stories

01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:30,510
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:32,550
resource limitations and other problems

01:01:30,510 --> 01:01:34,380
but how do you keep an eye on all of

01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:36,660
your systems performance metrics in
