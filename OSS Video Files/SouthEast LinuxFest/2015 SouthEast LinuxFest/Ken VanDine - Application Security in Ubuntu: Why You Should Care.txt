right i'm kim van dyne i wanted to talk

00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,430
a little bit about a application

00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:13,720
security in it 12 we've touched on this

00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,299
a number of times I know Mike's

00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:21,490
mentioned that confinement a lot of that

00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:22,570
is how we solve application security and

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,510
right now these are the things we have

00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:27,010
in place on the phone but as we move out

00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:34,560
to the snappy desktop and the

00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:37,840
convergence will be set back all right

00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:48,989
as we move on to the snappy desktop and

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:48,989
convergent farther

00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:01,940
alright is that okay testing convergence

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,659
that seems to be the bad we're here

00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:09,060
convergence alright so right now we have

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:10,770
all this in place on the phone and as we

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,899
get into the snappy desktop in our

00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,270
convergence you filling out that

00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:18,540
convergence story this will be what we

00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:20,549
see on the desktop as well so the

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,990
application security is a few things we

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,509
really care about controlling here so

00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,430
access the content access the hardware

00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:28,289
and access the system resources things

00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,259
like in a background process is raining

00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:33,360
um access to hardware like need location

00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,520
service of people applications track

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,100
where you are things like that we really

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,720
care about that stuff and these are the

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,460
reasons why the ministries are

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,080
experienced something's constantly using

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,819
a bunch of CPU dragging your phone down

00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,390
using a lot of memory when it's not the

00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:53,700
app active application draining your

00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:56,069
battery data protection privacy how many

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,140
people have installed in Android app

00:01:56,069 --> 00:02:00,450
that required access to their contacts

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,689
that really has nothing to do with

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,100
contacts like a flashlight program

00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:06,479
brightest flashlight I don't know if you

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:10,110
guys have heard the story of this one

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,610
but it's kind of famous there's like 50

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,910
million downloads or some crazy number

00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:19,640
of this free flashlight app and it

00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:23,489
requires GPS access your location

00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:26,959
requires full network access it can

00:02:23,489 --> 00:02:30,630
prevent your device from sleeping um

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,859
install shortcuts crazy but what this

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:34,350
app was actually doing is in the

00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:36,630
background it constantly reported your

00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:38,940
location associated with your google

00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,470
account back to some remote server and

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,560
they were selling that marketing

00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,930
information and the real nono here why

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,130
they got sued by the FTC over this was

00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,850
because they were correlating the

00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,230
location with the ID it wasn't anonymous

00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:53,640
the settlement they made in this app is

00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,100
still available in the store and it

00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,750
still does it the Play Store but the

00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,310
first time you run it there is a nag

00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,900
screen it says this is our privacy

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:03,659
policy please raise it we didn't accept

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,190
it if you click the next button you no

00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,050
longer get asked again and most people

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:09,160
just like the next button so this

00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,050
flashlight app that you use to see

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:12,730
at night is tracking your application

00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,500
all the time even when you're not using

00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:17,080
the flashlight attracts where you are in

00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:25,930
reports back who you are all the places

00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:28,240
you've been yes it would it wouldn't get

00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,160
your precise location but it also has

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,020
approximate location above it's kind of

00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:33,880
hard to read on the slide here but it

00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:35,800
can use network access to determine your

00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,260
location as well so it won't be as

00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:40,360
precise but it tracks that constantly

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:43,060
and that when do you see this screening

00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,320
your install an app on on Android you

00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:47,500
see when you run it or when you install

00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:52,150
it one time you see when you install it

00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:53,530
and most people never read them they're

00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,150
they're going to be going to a model

00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,100
that's more similar to ours pretty soon

00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,690
with em yeah they get to play catch-up

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,070
similar thing here movietickets.com now

00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:06,010
this was not a malicious app this is

00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:11,070
just one I happen to have installed but

00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:13,720
it can read and modify my contacts why

00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,920
things like that just the location makes

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,120
sense for this because I want to find

00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,010
movies that are close to me so that's

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,810
fine it's not necessarily malicious but

00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:22,480
almost every app you install wants to be

00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:28,210
able to read your contacts that really

00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:29,530
bothers me Oh in it now this one doesn't

00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:30,940
prevent your device and sleeping that's

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:32,470
another one really burns me up the

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,320
groupon one this is one that I actually

00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:37,990
use in it requires location makes sense

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,620
most of these things make sense but it

00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:43,660
also prevents your tablet from sleeping

00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,400
and it can run and start up so it starts

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,560
up automatically it doesn't use like a

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,120
push notification service so it can send

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,669
you here's the deal you might want to

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,400
look at periodically it's constantly

00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:57,940
running using your battery and talking

00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,310
to the network to hole for for

00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,880
information to feed to you that bothers

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,350
me so what we do for application

00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,090
security we achieve that without issue

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,810
confinement which might talked about a

00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:12,100
little bit truststore I'll get into a

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,160
little bit more an application lifecycle

00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,410
that might also mentioned how we control

00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,750
what processes have processing resources

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,550
on the device

00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,860
so the application confinement here's a

00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,600
little diagram that kind of illustrates

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,910
it but your app every app that gets

00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,910
installed is bundled inside of this

00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:34,250
update a parma profile where a farmer

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,710
prevents access to things outside the

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:39,500
sandbox it's literally a sandbox it

00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:42,110
can't access anything that we don't

00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,360
allow it to access so all it can access

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:46,460
this other applications data it can't

00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,250
access hardware bits of information that

00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,720
it's not allowed to and this is where

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,639
the trust store comes into if it tries

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,400
to access something like say your

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,740
location it will prompt you and the user

00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,530
at runtime when it needs it should I

00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,410
allow this as opposed to an installation

00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:05,720
time but running these things inside the

00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:07,250
sandbox in a completely protected

00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,860
environment is how we're able to very

00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:12,430
rapidly get apps into their store this

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:16,460
new we can trust that these apps are

00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:18,560
going to be safe I'm talking about

00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,620
content in confinements this is really

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,360
about the data protection and privacy

00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:24,380
all content is and this is something

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,849
that's been a little bit controversial

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,039
and that's some of the reasons I want to

00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:31,820
talk about these is all content is owned

00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:34,220
by an application so there is no real

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,690
notion of like a global place for all

00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:37,910
your photos to be stored on your device

00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:39,800
if you have more than one gallery

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:42,830
application there could be different

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,840
photos in different galleries and there

00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,700
you have to use those galleries to

00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:49,070
access that photo there are ways to

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:52,760
share that content between those but by

00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:56,150
default app a cannot access content is

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:58,010
created by at be not without you knowing

00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:59,690
it that's that's the key here is there

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,820
there's ways that those apps can work

00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:06,889
together but they can't happen without

00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:08,449
you knowing for example an application

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:10,250
that wants access to your contacts like

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:12,740
it seems like every Android app in the

00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,660
Play Store wants these things are

00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,010
running in the background and they look

00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,780
for new contacts that have been added

00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,820
and maybe they're trying to associate

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,590
your friends or reporting back

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,820
information about who you know to their

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,530
servers or whatever they're doing

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:26,030
they're doing these things in the

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,419
background well that you ever knowing

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,880
they're accessing your contacts in our

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,840
model with our our confinement is in

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,540
order for an applicant

00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,000
patient to access a contact it literally

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,760
says I need to request some content and

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,440
it's of type contacts and they get

00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,030
prompted saying which application do you

00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,990
want to find your contacts and they'll

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:46,699
get a little prompt and he had a

00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:48,590
screenshot of that I wish I had

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,389
screenshots of that I wrote it and I

00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:51,650
didn't know screenshots ever but you get

00:07:50,389 --> 00:07:55,130
prompted a little list of applications

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,419
that support contacts and chances are s

00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:58,729
in the address book you choose the

00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,229
address book and you get a picking user

00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:03,169
interface so it's not necessarily the

00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,880
same user interface similar as the

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:06,590
normal way you go into the address book

00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,630
which you'll get a UI that'll let you

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:11,120
select contacts that you want to give

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,310
back to that other application so the

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,770
application that's requesting it never

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:18,260
directly accesses your address book it

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:20,030
tells you as a user you're going to go

00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,860
get this from the address book and the

00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,810
address book the owns those contacts

00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:25,430
provides the user interface for

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,430
selecting them and handing those

00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:30,680
contacts back over so as a user you're

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,140
driving the user interface of them when

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,969
they get those contacts as opposed to

00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,419
something in the background just mining

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:39,890
your contacts in this this history for

00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:41,390
all types of contacts the same thing for

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,610
pictures if you have an application that

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,020
wants to open a picture to upload it to

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,500
Facebook maybe you want to edit it draw

00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:50,930
some goofy mustaches and stuff on Mike's

00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,490
picture and upload it to Facebook you

00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,740
can have an app that does this pick a

00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,120
picture it'll find all the sources that

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,790
on your phone for pictures like the

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,410
gallery app import that edit it and then

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:03,560
share it out to the Facebook app and

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:06,200
none of those apps directly access

00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:08,660
content from the other app they ask each

00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,420
app that hand it off to them and hand it

00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,209
off them and this is how they they work

00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:16,700
work with the sandbox so the content

00:09:14,209 --> 00:09:23,480
have provides a bridge for the sandbox

00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:25,580
they get content so I'm go getting into

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,560
the trust or trust store is a little bit

00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,920
different so this is another another

00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:34,279
mechanism we call them trusted handlers

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,440
for trusting an application to access

00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:38,690
some information now these this will

00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:41,570
never be content from other applications

00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:43,490
and it won't actually be accessing other

00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,950
applications it will be accessing

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:46,680
resources on the device like maybe your

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,870
GPS for

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:51,420
location service so nap needs to know

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,950
your location at runtime and it actually

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,870
only does at one time we don't know you

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,240
every time but it asks uses this

00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,750
application has ax requested access to

00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,290
location you can allow it or deny it and

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:06,180
not only can you allow it or deny it now

00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:07,770
but if you decide later on that you no

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,690
longer want to allow this how apt to

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,490
have access to your location you can go

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,990
into our settings you I and see a list

00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,630
of all the apps that have access to the

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:17,160
location and turn it off same thing for

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,600
the camera if you don't want to have an

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,810
application as access to your camera

00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,420
anymore you can turn it off anytime an

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,899
application should handle this and no we

00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,430
know how to deal with that so these are

00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,950
the ways we protect these things from

00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:36,480
using like the location behind your back

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,180
another thing which I'm a huge fan of is

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,380
our application lifecycle right now on

00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,300
the phone this will change a little bit

00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,160
as we get into the desktop but there's

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,870
only a single application that can be

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,790
focused on display at one time on the

00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:51,690
phone and that's the only application

00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:53,880
that uses any processing applications

00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,440
get paused when they're no longer used

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,870
and they're not running that way you're

00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,360
not consuming processor processor time

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,910
we're draining your battery and over

00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,529
time as you need more memory will kill

00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:06,839
these old applications completely stop

00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:10,230
them because maybe you haven't used in a

00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,540
long time it drops down the stack but

00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:15,120
when we get into a desktop convergence

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:17,010
will have multiple apps will be able to

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,720
have focus at the same time well I'm

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,380
sure these roles will be modified a

00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,360
little bit for that here's a vigil for

00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,010
that so you see the top the top app on

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,750
the stack is the current focused one

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:30,120
that's the only one that's running and

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:31,800
will pause as many applications I mean

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,860
that stack as we can until we need more

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,060
memory and then the least used one will

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,750
get dropped it will get completely

00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:44,250
stopped to free up RAM trusted helpers

00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:46,050
which I mentions that the content hub is

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:49,230
how we bridge the content between

00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:51,240
applications and with by bridging

00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,160
content mean we can export content from

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,850
a nap set like kind of the open with

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,500
type example so I have an image in my

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:00,000
gallery app and I want to open it with

00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,630
this other application that can edit a

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,610
photo

00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:06,910
that's like open with that sends data to

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,620
this other application there's a picking

00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:10,120
operation which is where I have an app

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,430
that means to pick a photo from the

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,350
gallery app so it opens it up that lets

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:16,690
them select a photo pull it back down to

00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:18,339
this app then that app can do what it

00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:20,470
needs to that content there's also

00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:22,390
sharing so if you wanted to take a

00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:24,520
picture in the gallery out say I want to

00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,230
share this it'll find sources that you

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,540
can share it externally the other people

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,120
like for example Facebook or Twitter or

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,920
whatever in the future will have things

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,180
like other devices like Bluetooth so you

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,800
want to send something to a Bluetooth

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,410
device you'll do the same thing with

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,480
content hub but this is all within that

00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,730
sandbox so the content hub is that the

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,300
way to get content out via trusted

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,440
helper media hub is also a trusted

00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,110
helper and I've definitely missed some

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,459
here but media hub is how the Mike

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,490
mentioned this earlier it's how your

00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:56,170
application you can continue playing

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,910
even when it's paused so if you have a

00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,770
playlist from your application say a

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:01,180
Pandora stream you want to listen listen

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,029
to your music once your application

00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,700
loses focus it's no longer using any of

00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:08,110
your CPU cycles but with the media hub

00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,450
handling the playback for you that

00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,010
doesn't matter anymore it's got the

00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:17,080
stream it knows how to play it and just

00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:19,690
plays it URL dispatcher this is how you

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,220
open other application so it's a trusted

00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:24,040
way to say hey find an application that

00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,410
can open this content online accounts

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,950
for finding accounts that you want to

00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,150
maybe share to Facebook whatever and I

00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:33,430
think you much went earlier to that I

00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:35,350
have forgotten here download manager yes

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,820
it's an application you can just say I

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:38,470
need to download something but maybe

00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,670
it's a four gig file or something crazy

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:41,890
like that you're not going to add that

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:43,779
app focused on your phone that pop that

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:45,279
very time it will just hand it off to

00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:48,880
download manager mean it doesn't matter

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:50,470
what happens to your app it's going to

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,880
be great having the desktop all of these

00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,260
things are going to be it's just you

00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,360
know taking this time to get there so

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:00,100
pretty much all I have basically you

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,480
shouldn't worry about your apps what app

00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,829
developers are doing to you you should

00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,620
be able to install apps out of the store

00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:07,360
and just be happy not worry about what

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:12,209
the evil developers on the other end are

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,209
doing with these apps any questions

00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:28,580
yes so are you presenting the fact that

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:33,580
there's an application that allows for

00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:36,890
all of this some blocking of information

00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,420
right right now our platform prevents it

00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:41,150
so when you install an application of

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:43,310
the flick store on a phone today it by

00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:45,200
default is completely locked down it

00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,520
can't access any of these things no

00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,710
matter how hard that development rights

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,950
this is blocked at the kernel level okay

00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:54,950
is there a GUI interface or a user

00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:57,860
control over which ones that you agree

00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:59,510
to or what well that's the trust or can

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:01,550
so depending on the type of the type of

00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,040
access like an application wants to

00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:06,080
access the location information it'll

00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,220
prompt you automatically the platform

00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,930
does it for you you don't have enough

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,160
developer as an app developer you don't

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,180
have to think about this it'll

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,100
automatically prompt the user do you

00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,540
want to allow it or deny it right but

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,800
you don't have an interface that lines

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,690
of all the applications that are running

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,900
and you can select which one should

00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,580
decide not to oh no no and the location

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:24,290
we do you have you can go back and turn

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,060
them all off yeah we do have a UI

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,980
that'll show you all the apps have

00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,410
access to location and you can turn off

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,150
any time we do have that but as far as

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:33,680
like the content stuff and things like

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:35,120
that is much more complicated they're

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,980
completely locked down they have very

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,110
limited they can only write data and

00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,550
read data from their own app space and

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:47,590
they don't have access to anything

00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:50,990
outside of their space remember yet

00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:53,360
approvals like if I say I want to give

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:55,640
this app access to this content all the

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,860
time without having to be rerouted and

00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,410
it won't ever do that it might it might

00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,510
remember so we'll have a notion of a

00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:05,510
favorite it's like you often choose this

00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,700
pier my bubble up to the top but it

00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:09,920
still always needs to drive through that

00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,860
other applications user interface so

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,360
it'll never just hand off the

00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,880
applications content but we do want to

00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,050
have a like a heuristic there to say

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,050
this is the coolest common

00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:38,769
maybe we can do something interesting

00:16:35,509 --> 00:16:41,860
with contents tourism SMA talking valid

00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:44,889
yes are there any chances of a

00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:47,720
notification hub for push notifications

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,910
because that's something that I'm not

00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:51,379
just push notifications with the users

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,329
displayed anything but what if I have a

00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:56,120
web service for example when I user

00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:57,410
registers to the web service I'll just

00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,959
I'm creating a social networking app

00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:02,449
then I can push content to the user hmmm

00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:05,929
we have that today works we had it

00:17:02,449 --> 00:17:15,980
worked mmhmm yeah Twitter does it gmail

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:19,730
does it let's wait for the mic and on

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:23,449
your security model how do you handle

00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:26,030
like advertising things like that like

00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:28,459
add banners and well that would be

00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:30,679
essentially network access right so most

00:17:28,459 --> 00:17:32,240
often in those applications are pulling

00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,150
that data down via the network and

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,010
displaying it within their app so that

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:39,950
application as long as it requests

00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:43,340
access to the network so like Michael

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,840
show when you set up the project in your

00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,669
manifest you could say these are all the

00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,590
policies I want to allow access to if

00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:50,450
you allow the network it can pull down

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:52,250
its own ad information displayed inside

00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,559
their own app you just can't push them

00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:57,470
to anybody else any other apps that

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,720
answer your question er well I was

00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,679
thinking more about like targeted

00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,299
advertising and things like that um so

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,220
that would have to essentially pull some

00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:09,220
identity information from the user right

00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:15,380
it's like for example like Google always

00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:17,929
knows tracks who you are and what you've

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,110
searched for on the web and can target

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:24,830
ads to you based on your browsing right

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:28,130
well I'm yeah you do not necessarily

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:32,000
need a personally identifiable

00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:33,470
information but you do need certain

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,320
criterias that

00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:38,630
are available so that the advertisers

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,250
can argue yeah and he says some some way

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,750
of identifying maybe it doesn't tie back

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,820
to you but saying this is the user that

00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,030
likes these things that send more

00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:49,610
targeted ads we don't really have

00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,840
anything that would allow that sort of

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,090
thing is essentially what you would need

00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:58,789
is like to say browser history access or

00:18:53,090 --> 00:19:00,559
something like that right you're right I

00:18:58,789 --> 00:19:02,539
mean or some sort of access to the

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:09,590
browser and apps don't have any sort of

00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:11,750
access to that right now context in

00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:14,510
history and cookies than what the actual

00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,770
browser uses there's no way for an a

00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,940
half to have any sort of access to

00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:21,679
anything that's been done in the browser

00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:24,159
I know this is how a lot of developers

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,159
make their money

00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:42,030
so the platforms that you're talking

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:46,680
that all this stuff is going to exist on

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:49,290
is a phone the tablet and the laptop

00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:51,120
ultimately ultimately out today it's

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,850
just a fun and it's Emma phones only

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:58,890
available in europe at this point except

00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:02,360
for the nexus as we talk so let's shoot

00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:07,350
for the American market of it here a

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:10,140
tablet coming out I mean is this this

00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:12,150
this would all be on the tablet in a

00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,950
year I mean are you whenever there's a

00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:19,860
device but actually said the snappy

00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:21,480
desktop is targeted for 1604 right 1510

00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,400
so the snappy does thought that anybody

00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,070
download install would have all of this

00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,750
built into it the desktop yeah on the

00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:41,090
desktop so unlike your laptop you can

00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:44,130
install it okay um how will this work I

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:47,190
like boom to I started off with it I've

00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:49,770
moved on to mint which is I guess using

00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,650
some portions or parts of it's a

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,080
modified version move into so we'll mint

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:58,500
pick up on any of this or what they lose

00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,950
our benefit would be up to them so me a

00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:05,520
lot of this is very tightly integrated

00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:07,170
222 the unity 8 shell mere these sorts

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:19,920
of things that the other distros aren't

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:22,080
going to pick up on right away so x 11

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,000
will let one app read the screen or

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,760
keyboard inputs or mouse inputs to

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,430
another so that that's a huge security

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,840
hold there that we all of our appt

00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:32,700
confinement is based around that not

00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:37,250
being there so it this all works on

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,250
mirror but it will not work on x 11

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:43,110
we will have we will have X mirror which

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,340
will run inside of a separate container

00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:46,690
and everything inside of that container

00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,330
this is how will support for snappy

00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,180
desktop what we're calling legacy apps

00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:54,010
but applications that were written with

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,440
the old paradigm like for example

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,900
LibreOffice things like that that aren't

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,020
necessarily running on near yet natively

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:04,180
and interacting with our api's they'll

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:06,790
all run inside of a single X mere

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,250
container and we'll have some legacy

00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:13,300
helpers for getting content between new

00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:15,760
apps and the old apps until all the more

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:17,230
common apps are you know really using so

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,020
then they'll all run inside their own

00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,000
sandbox but not individual sandboxes so

00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:31,000
like and libreoffice would have

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:33,760
access to the same files yes so what is

00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:36,040
the cost of what you have to offer at

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,530
this time I mean by the cost is there a

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:40,990
cost for like downloading this not free

00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:42,850
to love it you just use me that well you

00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:44,320
needed a bunch of phone which work on

00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,440
our Nexus 4 you can install it yourself

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:51,700
today if you want if you have grown

00:22:47,440 --> 00:23:02,560
nexus for the software is free thank you

00:22:51,700 --> 00:23:05,160
ah see number of questions who asked the

00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,160
best question

00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:21,480
okay so how many check it away t-shirts

00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:24,180
or one arduino any mission uh see

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:28,470
arduino the guy who asked about the brad

00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:31,380
targeted ads was a good question unless

00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:39,300
you'd rather have a shirt arduino or

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:50,580
shirt okay i'm glad i asked him I'm glad

00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:55,290
I asked um you didn't ask a question you

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:58,160
did ask a question as a push

00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:58,160
notification guy

00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,960
your customers rely on your website or

00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,120
application if it's slow are

00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:03,060
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,860
and costs you money keeping your

00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:08,150
business critical systems humming along

00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,280
requires insight into what they're doing

00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:13,290
your system metrics tell stories stories

00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:15,540
that can reveal performance bottlenecks

00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:17,850
resource limitations and other problems

00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:19,650
but how do you keep an eye on all of

00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,230
your systems performance metrics in

00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:25,020
real-time and record this data for later

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:26,970
analysis enter longview the new way to

00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:29,040
see what's really going on under the

00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:31,140
hood the long view dashboard lets you

00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,120
visualize the status of all your systems

00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,030
providing you with a bird's-eye view of

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,970
your entire fleet you can sort by cpu

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,430
memory swap processes load and network

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:44,010
usage click a specific system to access

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,020
its individual dashboard then click and

00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:49,020
drag to zoom in on chokepoints and get

00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,000
more detail comprehensive network data

00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:53,700
including inbound and outbound traffic

00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,290
is available on the network tab and disk

00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,180
rights and free space on the disk

00:26:55,290 --> 00:27:00,030
stabbed while the process explorer

00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:02,550
displays usage statistics for individual

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,740
processes the system info tab shows

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:06,960
listening services active connections

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,120
and available updates adding long view

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,800
to a system is easy just click the

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,350
button copy the one line installation

00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,930
command then run the command under Linux

00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:17,730
system to complete the process the agent

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,620
will begin collecting data and sending

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,190
it to longview then the graphs start

00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:23,800
rolling

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:26,170
use longview to gain visibility into

00:27:23,800 --> 00:28:05,560
your servers so when your website or app

00:27:26,170 --> 00:28:07,120
heats up it stays up Citrix XenServer

00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:09,850
gives you everything you need to

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,100
integrate manage and automate a virtual

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:15,250
data center all on an enterprise-class

00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,860
cloud proven virtual platform and at a

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,690
third of the cost of other solutions but

00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,340
why even bother with virtualizing your

00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:23,590
server infrastructure in the first place

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,290
well let's say you have a traditional

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,430
one server to one application

00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:29,700
architecture but you're running out of

00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:31,840
resources and performance is suffering

00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:35,250
once you order new server hardware

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:38,410
you'll wait for delivery configure it

00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:41,800
install your business application stage

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,990
and test the server and finally add it

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,000
to your production farm if you've been

00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:48,610
through this process before you know it

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,860
can take weeks or even months you also

00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:52,540
know it's a manually intensive process

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,690
that will burden your team every time

00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,580
you outgrow your current setup with a

00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,470
virtual server solution you could

00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:02,290
accomplish all of that in less than half

00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:04,930
a day server virtualization software

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:07,360
separates the OS and application from

00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:09,250
the underlying server hardware and with

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,350
multiple virtual machines on a single

00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,320
server you can use each of them to run

00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,060
different os's and applications this

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,920
makes it possible to move your virtual

00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:20,320
machines from one piece of hardware to

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,600
another whenever you want to maximize

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,550
utilization simplify maintenance or

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,860
recover from a hardware failure and

00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:29,920
without slowing down your applications

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,890
or users clearly server virtualization

00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,960
provides big benefits and Citrix

00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:37,110
XenServer provides even more

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,340
since it's built on an open platform

00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:41,740
xenserver plays well with your existing

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:44,049
hardware storage systems and IT

00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,640
management software as well as with the

00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,190
industry's leading cloud service

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:49,630
providers best of all you can get

00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:51,700
started by downloading a fully

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:54,700
functional production ready version of

00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,130
xenserver for free after a 10-minute

00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,750
installation process you'll see how easy

00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,669
it is to start virtualizing your

00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:03,100
workloads and automating your IT

00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:04,690
