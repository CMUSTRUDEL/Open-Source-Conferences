that the in this story you invest a lot

00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,960
in the crew you want them to be able to

00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,030
function as a unit you want them to

00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:19,089
build their individual talents and

00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:24,609
succeed well almost you know it didn't

00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:27,099
always work so and they scale up so when

00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:30,009
you have a certain version of a ship you

00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:33,309
you know you you improve upon it you

00:00:30,009 --> 00:00:35,530
build up okay so there are the different

00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:38,469
enterprises and don't even get me

00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,940
started on the reboot okay now let's go

00:00:38,469 --> 00:00:42,699
over to Star Wars land something you

00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:47,199
might be more happy over here so in Star

00:00:42,699 --> 00:00:49,359
Wars there are so many ships cuts to

00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,929
story you know when the Revenge of the

00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:54,670
Sith came out um and they had that final

00:00:52,929 --> 00:01:00,940
tie fighter battle scene this is like

00:00:54,670 --> 00:01:02,320
episode four five six you know and

00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:04,750
you're looking at that and there was so

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,190
much better than what came out 1977 all

00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,290
those Tie Fighters coming right at your

00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,920
screen you're like whoa this is star

00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:13,870
wars they have a lot of ships there's no

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,550
getting them getting around that whether

00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:18,010
the big battle cruisers are the TIE

00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:19,570
fighters there's a x-wing fighters

00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,850
there's a ton of ships running around in

00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,970
Star Wars universe and those ships

00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:28,660
typically our singular purpose I'm going

00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:31,570
to chase you down and kill you these are

00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:33,580
not happy people I'm just saying but

00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,650
they're there you know I'm pretty sure

00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:38,260
there's not a lot of science labs in

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:40,300
there I'm pretty sure there's not a lot

00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:42,010
of research going on in there I mean

00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,880
this is a these are ships that are

00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:48,070
designed to control and manage a large

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,220
galaxy full of people that they just

00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:53,680
want to just boss around and be mean to

00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,140
ok crew investment there's not really a

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,030
lot of crew investment heck in you know

00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,670
in the early days they just grew their

00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:02,410
crew you know we don't need to go out

00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:05,290
and recruit people and put them through

00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:07,360
some sort of fancy smancy academy let's

00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:11,740
just brick and clone the things and

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,450
we're done you know so yeah not a lot of

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,540
crew investment there and again this

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,219
fall as a cloud

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,200
shooting model because in your machines

00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:21,019
in the cloud computing you don't

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,819
necessarily have a lot of multi-purpose

00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:24,920
machines their singular purpose they're

00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:26,900
there to do the app and if they fail

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,090
they fail you just bring up another one

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,000
or two or three or four this is what

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:33,470
cloud computing is all about and of

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,500
course they had some serious discipline

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:38,959
issues with the crew as well because I'm

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:43,790
sorry I'm red that's like the worst job

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,700
performance review ever just saying not

00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:50,450
judging wait yes I am so there you go so

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:54,439
star warships are about scaling out you

00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:57,260
got a problem get more ships that's the

00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,769
situation there it's not about scaling

00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,689
up and going out in the galaxies explore

00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,659
strange new worlds and build bigger and

00:03:02,689 --> 00:03:09,739
bigger ships no you got it you got an

00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:11,569
issue just build some more ships some

00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:14,720
other their differences health care star

00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:17,060
trek again like the pets you take care

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,159
of them you have state-of-the-art cool

00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,109
looking sick Bay's that take care of

00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,470
your crew and make them feel better and

00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:27,169
you know and and get them back on their

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,549
feet and out into the ship you know Star

00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:31,459
Wars you just dunk them in this tight

00:03:28,549 --> 00:03:34,430
tank of whatever and by the way there's

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,530
I today I have not seen a human doctor

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:39,109
running around in any of these they use

00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,870
droids to take care of the humans in the

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:45,049
tanks full of you you know so health

00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:47,750
care me not so much patch them up get

00:03:45,049 --> 00:03:49,790
them on the feet we don't care training

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,470
again like I mentioned Star Trek it's

00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:54,680
all about the Academy getting everything

00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:56,720
back up to speed again the pets model

00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,129
follows that very well as opposed to

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,319
Star Wars where you have the cattle

00:03:58,129 --> 00:04:01,970
model training is basically just hey

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,319
let's just take some farm kid from who

00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,579
knows where and throw him at the death

00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:09,260
star and see what happens now get it all

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:12,859
worked out so it's all good but you know

00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:15,439
I don't know that does not strike me as

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:17,299
a big blot of training and planning I

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,729
don't know and maybe I'm biased cuz you

00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,259
know red hat certification but I'm not

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:24,469
sure that's a good certification in the

00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:27,260
force just saying I don't know now

00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:28,660
sometimes there are because everybody

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,550
has an exception

00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:34,330
you know we say Star Wars scales out

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:38,870
they get a lot of ships well not always

00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:41,900
twice they built this bad boy okay they

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,180
scaled up okay they weren't they were

00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:46,040
not messing around here they're like oh

00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,570
we don't need to build a bunch of ships

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,750
we're just going to build this bad boy

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:54,470
and you know sending around and you know

00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,389
do terrible mean things okay and you

00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:58,310
know occasionally there was there were a

00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,350
few instances in the Star Trek universe

00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,110
where they would throw every single ship

00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,139
they had at a common enemy and hope that

00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,780
that worked out but it's interesting to

00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:10,970
note that within the stories within the

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,919
universe is created and the worlds that

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,940
were built in Star Wars and Star Trek

00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:18,770
these examples didn't always work out

00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:23,000
for a bunch of Federation ships at the

00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:27,070
Borg and this might happen you know it

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:31,340
took creativity and multiple you know

00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:33,380
multiple skills in diversity to defeat

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,690
the Borg not a whole bunch of firepower

00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,039
and you know we pretty much all know

00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,060
what happened to the Dead star when they

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,690
scaled up you know every single time

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:46,490
come on so there you go so the you know

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,220
sometimes the counter examples didn't

00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:52,310
always work out so well because

00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,470
sometimes but again this gets back into

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,620
you know what you tell your customers

00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:02,380
and your users sometimes you do need the

00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:07,639
cloud sometimes you do need the whole

00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:11,510
you know many ships do you know good

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,979
things well you need the fighters or you

00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:15,139
need something like virtual machines

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:17,180
where you need fewer specialized ships

00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,539
that can take on really specialized

00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:25,910
problems and deal with that in in a

00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:29,060
particular way and you can use both you

00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:33,220
can you know take things yeah there's

00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,220
copyright violation all this bad boy

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,180
you can use both and in many

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,430
organizations there are situations where

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:43,500
we will tell people you know let's use

00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,780
virtual data center management for your

00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,460
say internal servers where you've got

00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,319
your accounting systems in your HR

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,060
systems and whatnot but if on your

00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,949
e-commerce systems where you are

00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,080
fortunate enough to get hammered at

00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:56,939
Christmas time and and or any other

00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,340
major holiday where you're selling

00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:01,080
things around you know you have cloud

00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,090
capabilities that can spin up your

00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,939
e-commerce servers automatically using

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:07,919
elasticity and go from there okay and

00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:10,050
use both and have them talk to each

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:15,000
other they don't have to be separate all

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:19,229
cases are based on use cases so say we

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:21,690
all so that's the story within this

00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:24,360
story because I kind of like this

00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:28,560
because this is basically both you got

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,750
both worlds and what so that's the

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,120
metaphor take it or leave it you can

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:36,840
have it if you want maybe better maybe

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:40,199
worse than pats vs cattle but all of the

00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,199
work that we do everything we do a Nike

00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:47,490
whether we're writing the simplest code

00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:52,789
is art this is what I went back to

00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:57,680
before where we we've defined we defined

00:07:52,789 --> 00:08:00,750
stories as art we give that the cachet

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,719
but I think that we NIT really need to

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:07,580
recognize that what we do is the same

00:08:03,719 --> 00:08:11,400
kind of art this is fractal

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:13,770
representations you know of mathematical

00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,360
higher mathematical concepts and maybe

00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,940
one day we'll figure out a way to

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,400
actually use this as data information

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:22,349
transfer in a human language sort of way

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,659
but right now it just looks really

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:29,639
ridiculously beautiful it's art so when

00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:31,349
somebody comes up to you and says oh you

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,089
work with computers or you're probably

00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:34,860
not that artistic and maybe you are

00:08:33,089 --> 00:08:36,419
maybe you know you're working on you

00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:39,000
know computers in your day job and maybe

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,169
you're a sculptor or you know part of

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,789
the maker movement or something like

00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,430
that and we're not kind of talking about

00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,829
that really because I recognize their

00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,850
individuals in this room in this in this

00:08:46,829 --> 00:08:49,800
community that

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,310
artistic in and of themselves in a

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,899
traditional way but I think you should

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:58,790
challenge people that talk to you about

00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:02,639
this and say now what I do is also a

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,560
creative way of doing it because when

00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,440
you create software when you create a

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,050
system when you even build documents to

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:15,209
explain how these systems work you are

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:17,940
telling the story so with that I have no

00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:20,639
idea where I am on time that is my

00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:35,279
presentation short and sweet any

00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:36,779
questions or comments yes yeah and I was

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,639
actually talking about this a little bit

00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,740
before you guys walked in because it's

00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,509
like okay so over it is the it's the

00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,819
virtual data center manager in this

00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:46,680
story so you have systems in the cloud

00:09:44,819 --> 00:09:48,839
like OpenStack and CloudStack and

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,339
whatnot or Amazon Web Services in the

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,680
public cloud those are cloud-based

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,750
systems and those use the cattle

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,000
metaphor the Star Wars metaphor whatever

00:09:54,750 --> 00:10:00,089
we're basically you treat individual

00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,660
machines as commodities very

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:05,970
transactional river and and very you

00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:08,759
know elastic as opposed to something

00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:12,060
like over which is really a system that

00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:18,139
treats individual machines as special

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:20,819
units it still scales we have one user

00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:22,740
that's using it in China and they're

00:10:20,819 --> 00:10:25,829
deploying a virtual desktop interface

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:28,560
and they're deploying 12,000 virtual

00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:31,259
clients I haven't confirmed this yet but

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,079
this is what they're telling me I'm in

00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:36,560
one province in china so it scales it

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,930
just doesn't scale instantly a lot

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,389
elastically because that's the beauty of

00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,730
cloud cloud just basically says the app

00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:48,029
itself says i'm running out of resources

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:51,060
I need help talk to the cloud API pulls

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:54,240
it in go where as opposed to something

00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:56,819
like overt it lets you scale as well but

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,519
you decide as a human the humans in the

00:10:56,819 --> 00:11:01,019
equation oh we added a new team we need

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,459
some more mail servers I'm going to

00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,619
spend

00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:07,279
them up and put them in this cluster an

00:11:03,619 --> 00:11:10,189
overt acts that way it's the commercial

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,949
it's in a free open-source project red

00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:16,639
hat is involved in it but we're not the

00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:19,429
only company that uses it as a

00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,639
commercial entity Red Hat takes the open

00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:26,179
source code and repackages it as red hat

00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,879
enterprise virtualization the company in

00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:30,980
china i mentioned cloud times they take

00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:33,740
it repackage it they have a commercial

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:39,170
downstream version as well and win river

00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:42,499
which is a subsidiary of Intel they also

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:46,910
use overt and they have a tool called

00:11:42,499 --> 00:11:50,240
open virtualization that they sell and

00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:52,399
support for so we were kind of unique

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,649
because most Red Hat projects that were

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,269
involved in you know it's a basically a

00:11:54,649 --> 00:11:58,970
straight line between the upstream and

00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,970
our downstream we have three down

00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:05,059
screens and two of them aren't even ours

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:07,069
so that's sort of the 32nd talk about

00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:08,420
that and I was telling him it's like I

00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:12,889
really need to figure out a way to tie

00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:15,049
this back into what I do so message

00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:26,869
received so it do you have any other

00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:31,309
questions it uses kbm so any any kvm or

00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:35,269
Kim you qemu shoe kbm is a oh I'm sorry

00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:37,999
so he asked does does it use or work

00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:41,079
with kvm and basically the answer is yes

00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:46,040
it fully you divide you Tulisa scavi em

00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:50,179
and so any kind of kvm or qmu virtual

00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:54,350
machine it will run it does not use end

00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:57,049
yet Zen is another hypervisor that

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,720
citrix is heavily involved in i will say

00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:02,689
that we are talking to them because at a

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,049
level if you go farther down the stack

00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:10,339
to like there's a tool called libvirt

00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:12,860
down there both Zen and kvm use lebert

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:15,379
heavily we're trying to figure out a way

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,569
now if well it were so

00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:19,459
sort of leaning on them that one set of

00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:22,939
libraries maybe we could start using

00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:25,579
overt to talk to them machines which

00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:27,229
once upon a time it used to do and then

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:30,429
it kind of stopped but now we're

00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:37,699
thinking about integrating that back in

00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:40,069
yes sir at this time at a very

00:13:37,699 --> 00:13:44,079
rudimentary level because it can treat a

00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:46,429
container oh he's asking I like that um

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,889
the question was can it manage

00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:50,869
containers and the answer is that this

00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:54,409
time it can on a very rudimentary level

00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:57,019
because the kankri it can sort of treat

00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:58,789
containers as just objects it really

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:00,589
doesn't do anything and it just says oh

00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:02,869
here's a container on this machine and

00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:05,989
you know containers a through f for

00:14:02,869 --> 00:14:07,459
whatever you can do that however with

00:14:05,989 --> 00:14:10,729
our work that we're doing in project

00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:14,029
atomic we work that project which is a

00:14:10,729 --> 00:14:16,789
container management system for not

00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,799
virtual machines but for containers it

00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:22,069
uses tools like Google's true brand

00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,889
Eddie's and whatnot so a bunch of our

00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:27,889
engineers on the overt team are looking

00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:30,579
at ways to say okay we could host a

00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:33,709
bunch of atomic virtual machines and

00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:37,009
have the containers running in there and

00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:40,039
use true brunette ease and talk to it

00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:42,499
and basically tap into those those

00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:45,499
atomic machines and control the

00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:48,109
containers from outside essentially from

00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:50,149
overt and we're we're working on that

00:14:48,109 --> 00:14:52,629
now I'm not sure that will be in three

00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:56,149
dots six which is coming up later this

00:14:52,629 --> 00:14:59,389
summer but I have a feeling it should

00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:02,779
show up in four dot o a lot of what Red

00:14:59,389 --> 00:15:04,970
Hat is suing is moving towards the using

00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:13,339
containers in some way shape or form yes

00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:14,419
sir well verb so the the question was

00:15:13,339 --> 00:15:16,429
what what's the difference between

00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:19,339
running like overt what's the advantage

00:15:16,429 --> 00:15:21,529
of using that versus verte manager bert

00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:25,189
manager will let you run multiple

00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:27,259
machines but it's clutchy and kind of

00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:29,270
it's not easy like if i had about five

00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:32,870
or six virtual machines and that's all

00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:35,150
had yeah I would use her manager um but

00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:38,450
anything beyond that and even really

00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:41,990
that to over basically lets you manage

00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:45,310
anywhere from two to again 12,000 or

00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,500
maybe a more virtual machines so you get

00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:51,110
it's very much a dashboard like

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,470
interface like like a on a feature

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:57,650
parity with vmware vsphere okay so you

00:15:54,470 --> 00:16:09,800
get that kind of of control and

00:15:57,650 --> 00:16:15,170
management of your system okay you're

00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:17,870
good okay so he's saying he's asking

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,550
what what are some of the features said

00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,800
over would have perhaps that would be

00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,380
better than Burt manager since he's

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:29,120
doing quite a few machines with Burt

00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:31,370
manager so things like domain management

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,950
individual disk management individual

00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,660
storage management you can manage

00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:37,730
multiple kinds of storage in the same

00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,790
domain so you can do I scuzzy fibre

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,270
channel Gloucester SEF what you know any

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:47,330
of NFS any of that in one I'm going down

00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:50,300
the list live migration between servers

00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,310
so you can basically just if you've got

00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,870
hardware that's getting squirrelly on

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,520
you you can just basically pick the

00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:58,970
thing up and move it and not even bring

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,740
the Machine down live snapshotting we're

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:02,870
going to interviews we have live

00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,880
snapshotting of machines now and we're

00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:07,670
introducing live snapshotting of storage

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:11,720
soon so there's that coming in three dot

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:15,100
six so I would invite you to you know

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:18,350
visit the website and we have pretty

00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:20,150
detailed list of individual features but

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:21,410
basically it's what you want to use I

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,570
mean if you're getting along well with

00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:26,570
verte manager been great because it's kb

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,760
m and whatnot solve a quick cummer

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:30,890
comments that question / answer so i use

00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,750
/ professionally my department and

00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:34,100
university is running it one of the

00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,710
other awesome things it has that you

00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,380
don't get with Lewbert is that you if

00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:41,600
you have an html5 web browser you can

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,190
get access to the consoles yeah which is

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,200
fantastic and you can't

00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,480
specifically you can't do that with verb

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,250
manager I've used it on an Android

00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,160
tablet late at night when I desperately

00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,050
needed to get to a vm console and just

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,730
fix something real quick and I was able

00:17:54,050 --> 00:18:03,170
to do it just with a tablet so it's

00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:04,400
fantastic that regard kimchi is actually

00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,410
we should ask Brian to talk about it

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,770
well kimchi is a sub-project of a verte

00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:12,740
that was put together and it's sort of

00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:15,740
like trying to take over the spice HTML

00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:19,160
it was a robot takeover but kimchi was

00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,460
an alternative to the spice HTML console

00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:25,730
and you know if you can get it to work

00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:28,120
and it works in for you then great most

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,290
of our users are using the spice

00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:32,720
interface and the console that he

00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:34,820
described you know so you may want to

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:41,270
swing back and take another look you

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:42,980
know it I will say to you in all honesty

00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:46,130
there hasn't been a lot of love to that

00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,110
sub project and it's like it's sort of

00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,360
on my list of things to look at because

00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:52,910
if we don't start seeing more activity

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,470
soon we may have to say well you guys

00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:57,530
are going to either have to go your own

00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:00,350
way or shut it down you know because we

00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:04,910
haven't seen it now a lot of action on

00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:07,250
it so hopefully that will kick in so the

00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:09,290
message is clear get more overt stuff

00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,720
into this presentation stop being all

00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:14,450
meta alright I hear you I hear you any

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,700
other questions that I promise to repeat

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:21,320
yes sir it was Saul meta well again I

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,550
thank you for your patience I certainly

00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,210
thank you for your time this afternoon

00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:28,760
on this the last session of southeast

00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:31,010
linux best have safe travels back to you

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:34,840
wherever you're going and we will see

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:34,840
you all next year thanks

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,170
citrix xenserver gives you everything

00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,080
you need to integrate manage and

00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,210
automate a virtual data center all on an

platform and at a third of the cost of

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,080
other solutions but why even bother with

00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,240
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,190
in the first place well let's say you

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,500
have a traditional one server to one

00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:18,480
application architecture but you're

00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:21,000
running out of resources and performance

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,330
is suffering once you order new server

00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,480
hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:26,480
configure it

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,580
you

00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:51,160
your customers rely on your website or

00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:53,530
application if it's slower

00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,560
non-responsive it infuriates your users

00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:58,360
and costs you money keeping your

00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,880
business critical systems humming along

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,190
requires insight into what they're doing

00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,140
your system metrics tells stories

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:08,180
stories that can reveal performance

00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,250
bottlenecks resource limitations and

00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,720
other problems but how do you keep an

00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:14,390
eye on all of your systems performance

00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,420
metrics in real-time and record this

00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:19,160
data for later analysis enter longview

00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,200
the new way to see what's really going

00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,360
on under the hood the long view

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,400
dashboard lets you visualize the status

00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,860
of all your systems providing you with a

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,250
bird's-eye view of your entire fleet you

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:33,830
can sort by cpu memory swap processes

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:35,630
load and network usage click a specific

00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,000
system to access its individual

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,510
dashboard then click and drag to zoom in

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,890
on chokepoints and get more detail

00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,570
comprehensive network data including

00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,910
inbound and outbound traffic is

00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:48,470
available on the network tab and disk

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:50,390
rights and free space on the disk

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,210
stabbed while the process Explorer

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:55,760
displays usage statistics for individual

00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,920
processes the system info tab shows

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,140
listening services active connections

00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,300
and available updates adding long view

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:03,980
to a system is easy just click the

00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:06,140
button copy the one line installation

00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:08,600
command then run the command on your

00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:10,280
linux system to complete the process the

00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,500
agent will begin collecting data and

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,330
sending it to longview then the graphs

00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,880
start rolling

00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:19,250
use longview to gain visibility into

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,210
your servers so when your website or app

00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:24,370
heats up it stays up

00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:26,410
Citrix XenServer gives you everything

00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:29,410
you need to integrate manage and

00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:31,540
automate a virtual data center all on an

00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,940
enterprise-class cloud proven virtual

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,550
platform and at a third of the cost of

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,380
other solutions but why even bother with

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:40,540
virtualizing your server infrastructure

00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,520
in the first place well let's say you

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,830
have a traditional one server to one

00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,810
application architecture but you're

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,360
running out of resources and performance

00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:51,690
is suffering once you order new server

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,580
hardware you'll wait for delivery

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,460
configure it install your business

00:23:54,580 --> 00:24:00,220
application stage and test the server

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:02,410
and finally add it to your production

00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:04,600
farm if you've been through this process

00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:07,120
before you know it can take weeks or

00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,980
even months you also know it's a

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,930
manually intensive process that will

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,260
burden your team every time you outgrow

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:16,030
your current setup with a virtual server

00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,820
solution you could accomplish all of

00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:21,370
that in less than half a day server

00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,200
virtualization software separates the OS

00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,630
and application from the underlying

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,790
server hardware and with multiple

00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,500
virtual machines on a single server you

00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,470
can use each of them to run different

00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,240
os's and applications this makes it

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:36,010
possible to move your virtual machines

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,110
from one piece of hardware to another

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,360
whenever you want to maximize

00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:42,340
utilization simplify maintenance or

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,620
recover from a hardware failure and

00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:47,980
without slowing down your applications

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:50,650
or users clearly server virtualization

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,650
