the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:09,929

fest org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,269
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,320
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:35,840
make these videos possible drupal people

00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:47,280
in the house say hey all right

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:50,129
excitement ensues right okay i like to

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,410
welcome everybody to using agar for

00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,649
drupal hosting and management and I'm

00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:59,190
drop mark Shropshire from at UNC

00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:02,100
Charlotte and so hopefully we can make

00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:04,500
this kind of interactive we've got a you

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,570
know a packed house for the sunday

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,960
afternoon sessions and that's for video

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,180
and so anyway we can make this kind of

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,750
interactive folks ask questions I'm not

00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:19,170
coming here as a as my disclaimer as an

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,880
expert on Eggar I'm still learning but I

00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:24,000
can step you through some of the things

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,290
that I've done with it and things that

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,290
we're trying to do out at the University

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:32,939
to leverage eager for our hosting

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:35,070
environment so I basically ripped this

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,340
off from the agar project site this is

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,659
what's acre so you guys can read that

00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,829
and go to the site and read it and it's

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:45,930
it's quite interesting but the one thing

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,590
that kind of disagree with it is

00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:51,360
statement is that deploying and managing

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,970
large websites I don't think nserror has

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,350
to be large that's just you know

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,509
whatever i'm sure some of the folks that

00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:58,860
have used agar and some of the folks in

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,070
the past have been corps commanders too

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,869
eager have have had plenty of large

00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:08,879
sites but i can tell you it works just

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,050
fine on small sites instead of doing

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,489
this at the end i kinda throw this up

00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,270
now so people can kind of take a look

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,330
but

00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,580
here are some good resources for eager

00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:21,810
if you hit the main agar project org

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,540
website they talk about some of these

00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:25,620
the Twitter account it's kind of the

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,910
that's kind of the main page where I

00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,770
talk about some of these resources but

00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,110
when you hit that page you'll see that

00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,760
there's you know main link to community

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,570
dagger project I don't work that's where

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,240
all the documentation lives for the

00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,520
project and kind of information on how

00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:43,320
to get into the issue queues if you want

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,690
to report bugs and things like that with

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,520
the project and go to that D but it's

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,170
got some excellent documentation on just

00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,150
how to install it and start using agar

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,960
and playing with it in that sort of

00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:58,770
thing and it's also the support folks

00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,800
are great on IRC feel free to pop in and

00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:03,360
ask a question and also as you if you

00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,280
learn some things about acre and you

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,860
know the answer feel free to jump in and

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,020
answer a question because when i was at

00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,660
drupalcon chicago and spoke with some of

00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:15,090
the the main folks who are coding vaguer

00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,830
project they're highly involved with the

00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:19,080
support and answering even the most

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,940
basic questions but obviously if some of

00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,950
us that don't know as much about it or

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,260
not involved in that level can answer

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,000
support questions it helps those guys

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,490
develop and write code instead of

00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,770
answering the same questions they've

00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,510
answered over and over so I try to help

00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,030
out there if I can and of course they're

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:39,870
on Twitter and that's mostly just

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:43,680
announcements and things like that as

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:45,180
far as installing a gir there's been for

00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,070
a long time kind of a manual process to

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,980
install but there's our actually now a

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:53,130
Debian package you just have to add the

00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:56,520
source to your sources list for apt and

00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:58,050
you can install it on the community site

00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,290
and our reference that saw a lot there's

00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:04,170
actually a page on the operating systems

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,020
which is below in a slide so you can

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:07,860
kind of check out if you're trying to

00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:09,989
you know running our different operating

00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:12,270
system then debian or moon to kind of

00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,670
what's supported and maybe you know

00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:17,520
there's some documentation on on how to

00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:20,370
handle those and maybe issues things to

00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,760
watch out for but right now we're

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,470
running it on debian

00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,770
and it seems to work well since that's

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:34,280
where it's developed mostly so and

00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:37,310
that's the page on that and anyway the

00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,630
installation guide I just I didn't want

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,190
really take take you guys to the

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,960
insulation because it's pretty simple

00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:47,210
especially if you're doing the apt-get

00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,430
install agar that's a way I like to do

00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,950
it now and kind of the preferred way to

00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:53,630
handle it if you don't trust that and

00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,960
it's a security thing or whatever you

00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:58,880
can still go through a manual process

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,340
but but that's that seems to work well

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,000
in the reason I just put the installing

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,920
link there is that there are a number of

00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,390
steps that you just want to check out

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,950
make sure you have your system has the

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:14,230
right you know requirements will field

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:14,230
and things like that to get it going so

00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:21,320
as far as components of agar and what

00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:23,870
makes agora and allows you to do some of

00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,980
the fun things which we'll get to in a

00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:28,450
minute some of the actual things that

00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:32,090
actually does for you there's the

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:35,270
provision piece which is the backend

00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:37,490
tool for all your system tasks so eager

00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:41,210
and emission it down below egger uses

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,970
drush it uses drush make and provision

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,450
is actually add rush command that Edgar

00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,370
execute in the background and handles

00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,460
things like migrating sites and cloning

00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,600
sites which is like copying sites and

00:05:51,460 --> 00:06:00,830
all of those tasks are handled by

00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:03,170
provision hosting is the is actually

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,180
just the front end piece and it ties

00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,000
together it basically ties together a

00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,190
lot of the pieces that provision has and

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,810
host master hazard to the next one the

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:13,880
next piece so it's kind of three big

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,390
chunks here three separate projects that

00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:19,400
make up the part but but hosting is what

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,410
is what it's kind of what you see when

00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,320
you go into agar the websites just right

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,330
now it's a Drupal 6 website and manages

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,800
you know as many sites and platforms as

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,830
you have

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,330
out there hostmaster is a profile for

00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:35,780
installing and setting up a ger and

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,690
that's what's executed as part of the

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,180
app get install or if you do it manually

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:44,419
to pull in all the pieces you know drush

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:45,560
and the elder theme that's part of the

00:06:44,419 --> 00:06:47,509
things that are pulled in my host master

00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,909
for during the install process of agri

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:52,069
itself and that's just a default theme

00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:56,800
that looks drill clean looks nice real

00:06:52,069 --> 00:06:58,849
minimal CSS just to make things simple

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,889
anybody have any questions about those

00:06:58,849 --> 00:07:05,690
pieces so far so this is getting into

00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:10,370
kind of the good stuff so once you have

00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:14,479
a grin stalled you've got three three

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:17,539
main components our entities and the

00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,300
servers this is where this is the and

00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:23,650
these are all nodes when you create

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,120
these become nodes so server that's just

00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:29,150
that's just a it could it be a web

00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,539
server it can be a MySQL server it could

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:35,000
be an engine X web server it could run

00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:36,139
web and database you can run one or the

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,729
other if you want to split up your

00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:40,699
database server from your front end

00:07:37,729 --> 00:07:42,590
server server is just a designation

00:07:40,699 --> 00:07:45,560
assist so that agar is aware that that

00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:48,139
thing exists part of setting up these

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,449
servers that involves instructions on

00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:53,779
this community site part of that

00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:56,449
involves configuring keys the way you

00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:59,300
want them so that the main agar server

00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:00,590
can communicate and copy over platforms

00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,069
and the files that it needs to

00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:06,440
distribute and also making sure that it

00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:08,690
has that that remote server has all the

00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:11,960
proper requirements whether it's PHP

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,779
Apache or whatever to process the sites

00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,930
that you have on there a platform is

00:08:14,779 --> 00:08:20,150
actually just a complete you know take

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:23,020
Drupal core it's a complete set of

00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:26,270
Drupal core with an install profile

00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:27,860
modules and themes and all the pieces

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,569
that you want to install so just imagine

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:32,630
when you go and look and you know you

00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:35,000
open up and look at a Drupal site is a

00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:38,839
suitable site you can actually pull that

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,430
in as a platform and make it a make it

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,719
something that eager then can just

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,519
create new sites on

00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:48,079
pop-up and and insights those are

00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:49,910
actually the individual websites that

00:08:48,079 --> 00:08:51,649
you're deploying from a platform and you

00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,910
can do multiple that's the whole point

00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,930
here is to actually have one common

00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:58,839
platform that you can use over and over

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,180
again and that you can upgrade

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,579
everything you know like if you have 10

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:06,709
websites on a platform I mean it's nice

00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:09,230
you can either upgrade those separate to

00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:11,509
a new platform or you can push the scary

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:14,300
button and try to hope that they all

00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:16,910
upgrade at the same time and I usually

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:21,170
don't like to do it that way yet but but

00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:23,089
it can be done so I figured I'd kind of

00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,040
break those out a little bit more and so

00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:27,319
remote servers we mentioned this here

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:30,110
remote servers can they can be a they

00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:32,569
can host web patchy and genetics and or

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:36,019
my sequel see some of that in the demos

00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:37,939
kind of how that looks in nature itself

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:40,670
and there's the docs on how to add a

00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:45,290
remote server which that's pretty simple

00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:47,839
pretty neat and you can you can actually

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,540
extend eager to have other service type

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,430
so if there's some other function or

00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:54,470
some other web server database server

00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,540
that you want to support course Drupal

00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:59,180
has to work with it or you have to make

00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:02,300
people work with it you can extend that

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,329
and have other service types a little

00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,730
bit on the development side and as far

00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:09,740
as platforms go I already mentioned that

00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,839
you can just take a existing Drupal site

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,180
and drop it into the platforms folder

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,579
and create a new platform for that but

00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:20,420
you can also use ad rush make file so

00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:22,250
you know if you want to I think address

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,110
generator there's address generator site

00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:26,389
that you kind of let you make little

00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,860
make files just to kind of test and play

00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:31,430
with or you can just write your own make

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:35,360
files those eager will take a make file

00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:37,459
and do whatever the make requests build

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,959
that out under / VAR / a corsage

00:10:37,459 --> 00:10:44,269
platforms and a standard build so that

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,000
you know it's there and when you want to

00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:49,699
upgrade a new platform it's as simple as

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,649
deploying a nude rush make file and then

00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,990
creating a new platform and then migrate

00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:55,690
in your sights too

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:57,310
new platform I say it's simple that's if

00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:02,310
everything works right you know if

00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,310
everything goes so we hope it does and

00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:06,070
so and there's just an example that's

00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,640
this is how I've been naming my make

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:12,370
files I'm I get real kind of crazy about

00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:16,270
naming and standard so that it doesn't

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:18,070
confuse other folks on my team so we've

00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:21,880
just been making a folder called builds

00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:24,070
and and then under that we we make a

00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:26,740
folder with a build name member that

00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:28,630
would you build named make and the

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,970
reason we do the folder for now is just

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:33,910
i figured that i may have to some point

00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,040
put it maybe you put other files in

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,420
there with that make file at some point

00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,740
or have another knee and maybe even a

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,089
readme or something but just to contain

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:46,089
those in a place that they can just live

00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:49,180
a site is a single website published

00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:50,770
using a platform so that's kind of the

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,240
in go or you know at some point you

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,130
wanna get to this thing going so you can

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,649
push the button and the site happens i

00:11:54,130 --> 00:12:02,649
need to play site in agar it maintains

00:11:59,649 --> 00:12:06,760
all of your apache v host configurations

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:10,209
is basically a sim linking a directory

00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,579
of your vhosts entries with you know the

00:12:10,209 --> 00:12:16,089
environment for that site back into

00:12:12,579 --> 00:12:18,310
Apache so that it can it'll kickstart up

00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:20,620
you know restart apache or do a reload

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:23,649
so that it so it's aware of patchy knows

00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:26,230
it's out there but also eager handles

00:12:23,649 --> 00:12:28,270
your database configs handles creating a

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,610
password for your database you don't

00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:36,480
have to get into all that it manages

00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:40,930
creating the databases it handles kron4

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:43,870
your sites and right now on the on the

00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:46,270
chrome piece I think right now cron is

00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:48,760
set sort of globally is what looks like

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:50,079
to me so far so if you want it if you

00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,730
need sometimes I have a need to run cron

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,579
more often for certain applications and

00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,230
things so we're using we're using

00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:59,680
Jenkins to run cron so i'm going to use

00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:01,089
jenkins just to call cron and as a you

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,750
know or you can just do it in crontab i

00:13:01,089 --> 00:13:07,240
guess if you need to do it more often it

00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:10,220
also creates drush aliases

00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:12,019
that actual the dress provision command

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,420
uses and that's just us that's basically

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:17,720
shorthand in the dress world so that it

00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:21,440
it it basically agar can reference

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,139
easily different sites and move those

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,300
sites around and performed rush commands

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:31,279
on them but those of aliases are

00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:33,529
available under VAR eger configs and so

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,879
you can actually use those draws a list

00:13:33,529 --> 00:13:37,730
as yourself there's functions you need

00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,589
to do so that's always there at the

00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:42,019
command line and it also handles

00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:44,389
permissions for the site so one of the

00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,430
things when you see a site being a look

00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:49,579
at the the log after a site has been

00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:51,199
installed you'll see notations about

00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,509
permission settings so it handles

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,019
permissions on your your files upload

00:13:53,509 --> 00:14:02,389
folders and you know all the places that

00:13:57,019 --> 00:14:03,769
need permissions checked and so and I

00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:04,970
did want to mention again you can extend

00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:07,339
a lot of things in egger you can stand

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:09,829
it's a Drupal site so again you can you

00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,050
can add additional modules and there are

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:13,970
some there's kind of a small ecosystem

00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:15,889
of modules for a gir but you can also

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:19,339
add other Drupal modules and test them

00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:21,259
and integrate them into a gir I've kind

00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,300
of a keeping my eager installs clean so

00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:25,639
far just so I know that if things go

00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,649
wrong it's something with that install

00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:32,660
and it's not another module causing

00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:36,170
issues but you can you can extend agar

00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,790
with other features and the sum of these

00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:40,519
show you the demo but there's some

00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,620
places where you can turn on SSL and

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:45,139
site alien so you can have other domains

00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,899
point to the same site I know in our

00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:51,199
world the marketing folks make us point

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:53,809
dub-dub-dub dot to sites even though we

00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,220
don't use that or care about that but

00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:59,209
that's that's how so we can use that and

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:00,680
you know there's some other ones that

00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:02,420
are important for using agar in my

00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,910
opinion the cloning feature which we'll

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,839
talk about in the site migration

00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:12,740
features so let's go ahead and jump in

00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:16,069
and take a look at you here and here's

00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,620
here's actually the community site the

00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:22,399
community tiger

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,810
project org site and so so there's some

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,899
this is just an open atrium site there's

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,310
some dashboard info and you know a box

00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:30,230
for searching for help but I usually

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,269
jump right to the documentation area and

00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:34,819
there's a handbook and it's done pretty

00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:37,009
well and it's wiki style so if you make

00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:39,860
an account you can edit and make changes

00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:44,630
and contribute right away sure those

00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:46,970
guys appreciate that any help so I'm VPN

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:51,610
back into home base so cross our fingers

00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,610
at this all this all works for us but um

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:59,529
this is the main login when you just hit

00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,529
her it's going to have a have you login

00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:15,110
okay so so once you log in you're going

00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:20,180
to see a list of sites we've got a

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:22,339
number of sites running here and so so

00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:24,319
what's interesting you have you actually

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:28,970
have the domain for the site you've got

00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:31,160
which profile it was built with you got

00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:33,380
your language when it's created and in

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,139
the platform and again this platform the

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:38,720
ideas you want to move towards running

00:16:36,139 --> 00:16:42,019
multiple sites off a single platform to

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:49,480
get really the benefits of a gir so

00:16:42,019 --> 00:16:51,610
that's your site's page it is using

00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,920
Drupal's the core multi-site

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,540
functionality that's exactly right I'm

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,250
glad you glad you brought that up it's

00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:00,110
an important feature so it's not so

00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,430
acres not do anything magical that you

00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:03,170
couldn't do just with a drupal

00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,870
installing just dropping folders under

00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:08,630
the site's folders with settings PHP and

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:11,679
and things like that but it just it's

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:14,959
helping to automate that functionality

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,339
so so that's the sites page you've got

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,569
these three tabs that you're going to

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,980
move between see my cursor there so

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:23,959
we'll just go look we'll take a look at

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,900
servers so this is the piece you kind of

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,040
set up and you don't touch after

00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,130
why won't you hopefully you get it set

00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,320
up and working and so we've got you know

00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:33,550
with your basically a standard out of

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,020
the box a curse all you're not going to

00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:38,230
have these last three those are our

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,940
extra servers that are running um you're

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,460
just going to have local host an entry

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:48,150
for the Apache they can be publicly

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:51,100
viewed and so we're actually running

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:53,230
three other debian remote servers and

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:56,050
each each of those have apache and my

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,830
sequel on them but as you see in a in a

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:03,040
minute when you create a site you do

00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,300
have an option to when you create a saw

00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,830
you actually have the option to say this

00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,830
is where my database lives so you can

00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:11,950
make it live on any of those servers or

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:13,750
just a dedicated server for mysql which

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:14,980
a lot of folks want to do just for

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:17,320
performance reasons so they can tune

00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,770
that server just to work well as a

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:23,460
database server right now the way we're

00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:26,820
splitting this up this is our this is a

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,950
swa 202 linux as a server that we use

00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:32,790
kind of development purposes and we have

00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:38,710
some get repos there and some are

00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:40,360
Jenkins applications there and we just

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:42,010
have that added to the system in case we

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,670
want to push something out to that box

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,800
and then right now 03 is a test and 0

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,520
for full server will be on linic

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:53,860
production but I intend on adding some

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,900
additional here real soon so our student

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,320
newspaper is running on Eggar right now

00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:01,240
with open publish and it's it's on

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,010
another server but it's it's got his own

00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,460
instance of agar and that's something I

00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:07,840
kind of learned along the way is you

00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,290
know I guess there could be reasons to

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,790
roll different instances of agar and

00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,700
legitimate reasons but in our scenario

00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:17,560
it just seems like we're probably better

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,260
off to have a central ager server and

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:24,460
just these remotes for everything at

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:26,440
least right now so any questions about

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,970
servers that's jump over to platforms

00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:30,970
kind of get to the more exciting stuff

00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:35,350
here so we've got a number of platforms

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:38,590
listing again this is this is this is

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,530
living under / VAR / platforms which I

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:48,800
can

00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:52,970
pop into here Brian Ronnie and catch

00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:59,090
that but that's deacons that's Deacon

00:19:52,970 --> 00:20:01,420
stuff you remember yeah I'm ball see if

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,420
we can

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,010
I might as well just show you kind of a

00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:13,200
so this is kind of a directory structure

00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,840
it so this this folder structure is a

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,340
little messy because of um I originally

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:23,160
installed egger manually and have since

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:24,420
moved it over to the apt installer so we

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,930
got to do some cleanup here at some

00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:31,050
point but but backups folders where your

00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:33,210
backups from eggert live and go builds

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:35,400
is a folder that I create that some of

00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,570
the other egger folks that have come way

00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,730
before me and worked hard on that

00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:40,140
project seems like builds was kind of a

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,430
standard thing that's where you put your

00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:45,600
make files and things like that in

00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:46,890
clients is part I didn't mention this

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,710
part because I haven't really this is

00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:50,820
like I said I'm not a expert but

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,300
clients is something that we probably

00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:55,650
won't use that right now at least but

00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,480
folks that want to provide drupal

00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,910
hosting and have clients this is a way

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,140
you can kind of sandbox a client into an

00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:02,940
area and say these are your sites that

00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:08,810
you have access to so it sets up kind of

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:14,730
the ACLS to handle that config is where

00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:16,800
your V host information lives and for

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,560
for Apache and things like that and

00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,290
there's drush and dot drudge has the

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,280
drudge make and provision that's where

00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:27,870
those guys live because those are drush

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:31,650
commands and hostmaster is your growing

00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,180
see that hostmaster is your main that's

00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,530
really that's really the agar install

00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,530
that's really the front in that you see

00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:41,460
platform hyphen builds is what I was

00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:42,810
using but for my bill of location I just

00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:45,000
changed that dividuals I've got to move

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,290
some stuff and get rid of this was a

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,730
little confusing for me because they're

00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:49,710
because agar has a folder called

00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:52,130
platforms where platforms live and I'll

00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,130
show you that

00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:04,809
so each of these except for that open

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:07,210
atrium tar zip file is actually a

00:22:04,809 --> 00:22:10,120
separate platform and I do want to

00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:12,280
mention something that that everybody

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,730
with a your project that works on that

00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,870
project is aware but something that

00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:18,960
something I heard and something I've

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:22,169
experienced the remote servers that is

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,669
kind of kind of goofy in a way but

00:22:22,169 --> 00:22:28,539
understandable on the way the remote

00:22:24,669 --> 00:22:31,090
servers work you'll notice that the way

00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:32,710
I've named these platforms they have a

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,320
server that's what that is at the end

00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:37,659
swear I t03 Linux and 01 Linux those are

00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:42,039
actual server host names and I put those

00:22:37,659 --> 00:22:44,950
attending platforms you can't right now

00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:48,010
make a platform in agar and then have it

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:51,159
live that platform live on multiple

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:53,320
remote servers so what that means is

00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:55,240
just something to be aware of you'll

00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,340
let's say that you've got a platform and

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,289
it's your Drupal 7 sandbox it's a

00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:01,090
development sandbox that has your

00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:03,400
standard build of development tools that

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:05,380
people use and test with and let's say

00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,580
you've got to development test servers

00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,190
and you want to have that out there you

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,730
would have to have a folder for one test

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:15,190
server and a folder for another I may

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:16,600
get this completely wrong the reason one

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,610
of the reasons that I've seen why that's

00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,710
the case right now there may be others

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,320
is because what egger does with the

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,789
remote is once you deploy a platform to

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,659
a remote server when you build the

00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:30,190
platform and show you that in a minute

00:23:25,659 --> 00:23:33,220
it's it actually our sinks over all the

00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,049
platform files so it's kind of creating

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,520
this one-to-one relationship between

00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:42,190
that master agar server in the remote so

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,039
it's it's it's something that folks are

00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:47,950
aware of and folks in the community or

00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,770
working on in the Drupal 7 version of

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,270
Acre from what I understand so just want

00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:57,669
to mention that if that was a little

00:23:52,270 --> 00:24:00,070
confusing so this is kind of interesting

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:03,190
on the on the on the platform listing

00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:04,980
these are all platforms the way we've

00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,090
decided to name our platforms now is

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,779
where we're putting our dresser make

00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:12,059
files and get and we we

00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,200
we have a repo for the make and any

00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,849
other files that need to live in that

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,849
for that site when we're ready to

00:24:17,849 --> 00:24:23,159
release a new make file to use on agar

00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:24,779
we're actually just tagging and we're

00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,019
just calling it build hyphen and the

00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,909
date kind of an European format and so

00:24:28,019 --> 00:24:31,440
that's that's where we get the names on

00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,960
some of these where it says like we're

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,219
using the conference organizing

00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,590
distribution kala don't know if you guys

00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:40,619
have heard that one use cod calm it's

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:41,669
pretty interesting distro and so we're

00:24:40,619 --> 00:24:44,369
using that for a couple of sites at

00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:48,359
university but you'll notice I have

00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:50,460
different builds and for the platforms

00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:51,899
so at one point these two sites that

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,339
were on this build we're actually on

00:24:51,899 --> 00:24:58,379
this previous bill and I've migrated

00:24:53,339 --> 00:25:00,089
them over so once once you've migrated

00:24:58,379 --> 00:25:02,729
and you don't have any sites living on

00:25:00,089 --> 00:25:05,599
that platform build you can delete the

00:25:02,729 --> 00:25:08,489
build so at some point I can remove it

00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:11,249
but probably like a lot of other folks

00:25:08,489 --> 00:25:12,719
in here that are sis admins we like to

00:25:11,249 --> 00:25:14,849
think take some time before you hit the

00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:16,969
delete keys onything and just make sure

00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:18,869
is that are we sure we want to do that

00:25:16,969 --> 00:25:20,700
so I've done the same here i've got a

00:25:18,869 --> 00:25:23,549
Drupal 6 sandbox build on Drupal 7

00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:25,499
sandbox build hostmaster is actually

00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:29,759
eggers front end it has to kind of be

00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:30,960
there and we've got I put open atrium in

00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,330
there and that was great for a make

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,419
final just to show that it can be done

00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:38,759
and it does show which release of Drupal

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,739
each of those are running on and it

00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:45,719
shows us which server we push them to

00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:50,450
and when it was verified what one thing

00:25:45,719 --> 00:25:53,419
that you'll see on sites and servers and

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:56,549
platforms is something called verify

00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:59,580
what verify does that is that is a time

00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:02,190
when egger can take an inventory like if

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:05,460
it's a platform it you're asking it look

00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:06,929
at this set of code base go back through

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,339
it makes your permissions are set right

00:26:06,929 --> 00:26:10,979
make sure everything is in order so that

00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:12,619
we can actually use it there's a on the

00:26:10,979 --> 00:26:15,239
community site there's a great page on

00:26:12,619 --> 00:26:17,339
verify that shows you each step that

00:26:15,239 --> 00:26:20,290
ager goes through for verifying sites

00:26:17,339 --> 00:26:21,640
verifying servers verifying platforms

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:23,200
that's definitely worth a read so you

00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,990
kind of understand when you hit a verify

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,340
button what's happening so a good

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:32,230
example of when you would need to verify

00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:34,270
a platform is let's say that you want to

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,790
quickly add a module to an existing

00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:39,400
platform you could I don't think this is

00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:40,840
the best practice but you could go into

00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:44,070
that platform folder and just do add

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,570
rush download just dl name of the module

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:48,400
but you would need to go to a verify of

00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:51,610
that platform after you did that

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,680
download so that agar says hey I know

00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,150
that module is there I'm going to deal

00:26:53,680 --> 00:27:02,560
with it and you know it's in my list of

00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:05,080
of inventory for that platform so so

00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,310
that's in on sites you know there's a

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,650
list of other things that verification

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:11,350
does on a site but you basically if you

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,930
making changes to the platform you can

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,120
run a verify a lot of times on sites you

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,560
run the verify if you're having problems

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,880
with a site you can run a verified it

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,100
may fix it if it's a permissions issue

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,060
and such but it's worth reading that

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,890
because it each each of those

00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:29,920
verifications has a list of things that

00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:31,480
it actually performs on the way so um so

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,680
I think any questions so far and will

00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,560
kind of get into making creative

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:36,880
platform result show you that so making

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,920
sure how to create a server because it's

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:44,320
a pretty pretty simple to do that and

00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,610
there's some other steps but so you can

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,080
go to create to do anything you go to

00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:51,370
create content is a Drupal site so we're

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:59,740
going to create content we're going to

00:27:51,370 --> 00:28:04,080
say create a platform and what we can do

00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:04,080
is we can name this platform and

00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:13,870
we'll call it Drupal 6 demo and I like

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:16,240
to do the build numbers you know some

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:19,530
build code so I kind of knew what have

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,670
some reference for what this platform is

00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:26,130
so that's just the name that's just the

00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:29,140
title of the node you know in Drupal so

00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:32,799
I kind of thought food how is going to

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:34,600
name these I don't bother putting the

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,520
server name if it's on a remote server

00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,380
in there because that's listed when you

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,100
look at the platform lists and I didn't

00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,870
bother putting the the version of Drupal

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
because you see that on the list of the

00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:47,110
platforms when you listen I'm just

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:53,190
trying to you know you put what's useful

00:28:47,110 --> 00:29:02,020
in that location the publish path is

00:28:53,190 --> 00:29:04,870
usually / VAR / eager / platforms and if

00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,260
you're going to use a makefile this does

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:09,040
not have to exist ahead of time so

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:13,419
that's what we're going to do so i'm

00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:20,410
going to call it d6 hyphen demo hyphen

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:21,640
build 2011 6 12 if if you're not going

00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:23,549
to use a make file and you leave the

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:27,280
make the next field here is make file

00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:28,660
can you guys see that ok out there or if

00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,710
you're not using to make file you do

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:34,870
need to create that folder and you're

00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,070
going to have to if you're not easy to

00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,750
make file you're creating a folder

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,760
actually dropping and install you know

00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:44,020
full Drupal installing to that folder so

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,250
so that's what it's going to build it

00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,130
off of and that's that that's a

00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:51,220
perfectly fine way to build it I like

00:29:48,130 --> 00:29:53,740
using Drudge make files when I can so

00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,570
that it's easy to track in an item to

00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,460
track all the code base completely and

00:29:55,570 --> 00:30:01,090
get or something subversion or whatever

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:05,830
so makes it kind of nice so the make our

00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:09,370
make file is life r / a gear / builds

00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:10,559
and i'm going to use a want to cheat a

00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:15,370
little bit and reason to preexisting

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,410
make final that's out there and here's

00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:19,060
where i can select which web server

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,960
this platform lives on this was getting

00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:21,280
that earlier that you're gonna have to

00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,230
make a platform even if it's the same

00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,610
make file that you're creating it from

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,220
you're going to make one for each server

00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,420
that you might have to have it live on

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,400
and it's not the end of the world it

00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,140
works it but it is something that you

00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,100
know I'd like to see so you improve for

00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:42,820
sure so I'm going to push it to over

00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:44,590
three hit save it's going to show us

00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:49,770
here the nodes been created and you'll

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:52,390
notice every every minute by default

00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:54,880
agar has a queuing kind of batch system

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,290
that has this queue and it's showing

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,120
that hey we've got a task in the queue

00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:59,890
to do a verify this platform that's

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,540
going to that's going to take that make

00:30:59,890 --> 00:31:03,460
file its going to run the make file its

00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:05,620
going to do whatever the make file says

00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,900
download Drupal from drupal.org gets

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,950
going to pull from I get repos what you

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,360
know what anything you want to make file

00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,950
is going to handle because it's just

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,860
drush make them it's not a great stretch

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:17,050
mate and then it's going to run through

00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:20,110
and do the Aegir stuff like permissions

00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:21,340
and you know us you'll log all the

00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:25,810
modules that are part of that platform

00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:27,640
and themes so that it's aware so that

00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:29,050
will run and that runs about every

00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,900
minute so hopefully if everything goes

00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,940
well we'll see that run shortly so you

00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,770
kind of move on and do other things

00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,710
while we're kind of on this page I'll

00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:43,390
mention a couple of things you can't

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:45,340
lock a platform and the lock prevents

00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:48,250
you from migrating let's say that you

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,510
have a platform and it's for some reason

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,010
you don't want someone accidentally

00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,270
might try to migrate that platform or do

00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,710
something with it you can lock it and

00:31:52,270 --> 00:32:00,700
you can't delete it you can't migrate it

00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:02,320
and migrate a platform that's that's the

00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,760
that's that global button that's that

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,890
one where if you have ten sites on this

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,350
platform running you hit that migrate

00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,240
and you tell it hey migrate to this new

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:13,660
bill whatever the new build is it's

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,170
going to try to migrate every site and

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,640
then delete deletes the the platform but

00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,440
edgar is pretty smart it won't let you

00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,390
try to delete it won't let you delete a

00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,960
platform if unless there are no sights

00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:29,279
on a platform and things like that so so

00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,809
it's pretty neat so if we go to

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,340
so that's kind of a platform side of

00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:37,750
things if we go to the site and the

00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:42,100
verifies running you can see it running

00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:45,309
now if it doesn't work you get a kind of

00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:48,279
a red-orange looking you know background

00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:51,419
on that area tells you bad things have

00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:54,250
happened does it give you an option to

00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:58,149
and it does happen you know anything can

00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:00,610
trip that but it does it does give you a

00:32:58,149 --> 00:33:02,110
log either way success or not so that

00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:03,490
you can see exactly what happened and

00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:05,500
what ran in its and that's actually a

00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:10,419
good way we'll pull that up on one of

00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:11,830
these but we'll go back into this so if

00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:16,960
I look if I go to this verify that just

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:20,730
ran I can take a look at exactly what

00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,809
egger performed to do the verification

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:26,529
gives you a little info at the tops as

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:29,379
it successful and took 18 seconds to run

00:33:26,529 --> 00:33:32,110
and it'll tell you also how much PHP

00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:36,129
memory it took which what you do need to

00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:38,409
give your your PHP see a lot more ram a

00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:40,360
lot of times they recommend like 192

00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:43,210
Meg's to start with but you know that's

00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,679
it's running not on your Apache PHP but

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:49,169
it's doing all this stuff dress

00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:51,519
provision against your command line PHP

00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:53,710
anyway so there's it just gives you this

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,309
huge list of all the functions it

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:59,230
performs here like loading drivers and

00:33:57,309 --> 00:34:00,669
it's creating the database I'm sorry

00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:02,769
it's not doing that on a platform but

00:34:00,669 --> 00:34:05,440
the sites do the same thing you have a

00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:12,179
log like that on the sites so we go look

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,179
at sites now and we'll create a site

00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:21,179
so I have to have you need you need to

00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,070
have your dns entries taken care of

00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:25,919
however your guillotine s you need to

00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:30,240
this is no different than any other

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,470
domain related web apache related drupal

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,470
thing I mean you know it's a web server

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:37,500
and so you've got to have hosts and

00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,000
everything set up and pointed so in our

00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,679
environment we don't have any control

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,149
over DNS so we have to put in tickets

00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:44,899
with networking so what we normally do

00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:47,820
is we line up a number of development

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,440
domains and just have those are just the

00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,169
NSA aliases and have those pointed over

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,329
to a certain servers so we can use them

00:34:51,169 --> 00:35:02,790
whenever we need so so I happen to have

00:34:54,329 --> 00:35:03,900
I think that one's available so when you

00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:07,440
create insight you just want to put your

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,570
domain name in for the site one thing

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:15,150
that kind of there's reasons for this

00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:18,990
but one thing that I that I really

00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:21,150
wanted initially and it's just not there

00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:23,880
with a gir you know a multi-site with

00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:28,050
Drupal you can do you can do actually

00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:29,369
sub sites under like a one domain you

00:35:28,050 --> 00:35:30,630
know using hyphens and stuff the way you

00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,010
name the folders you can actually do

00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,619
subsites that's one thing that Edgar

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:37,470
doesn't do and I seem like to me a lot

00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,240
of it had to do with just you know the

00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:40,440
folks are involved didn't have you know

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,200
they didn't have an e four so they

00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:44,640
didn't really push on that I was told

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:47,160
there's some technical reasons why they

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,420
didn't want to get into that because you

00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,089
know that you still have to have some

00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:53,579
you know master drupal site at the top

00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:54,720
of that trees but in the university

00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:56,849
environment we have needs some times

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,800
where we have a domain and you it'd be

00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:01,920
nice to spawn off sites underneath that

00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,400
so you have domain / site 1 / slight too

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,589
and there's there's other ways that you

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,819
can do that that are probably better

00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:14,790
than using agar quite honestly and I'll

00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:17,150
shout out domain access as for one hey

00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:19,369
um

00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:22,190
and so you can you can do encryption

00:36:19,369 --> 00:36:24,260
I've got the ssl feature turned on and

00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:27,079
what's really cool especially for test

00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:29,420
and development is you can actually if

00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:31,400
if there's not if you don't have cert

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:33,500
set up on your server that agar can find

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,230
in Europe a cheese configs it will

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,819
generate self-signed search and that's

00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,170
that's kind of nice you know we just we

00:36:37,819 --> 00:36:41,299
just want to encrypt things and just

00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:44,500
make sure it's things work over SSL and

00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:46,730
we're not going to do our our CA

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,750
properly signed certs until we go

00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,710
production so we have a wildcard cert

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:54,650
that we use for instance then they

00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:56,270
charge you per domain as part of that

00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:58,369
wild-card so it kind of keeps us out of

00:36:56,270 --> 00:37:02,180
having to pay for those hopefully in the

00:36:58,369 --> 00:37:05,210
future now so it tells you what client

00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:09,529
we're just admin is creativeness you get

00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:11,630
to pick your install profile so we can

00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:15,849
pick up an atrium conference organizing

00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:19,930
distribution you know minimal and

00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:23,750
testing i believe for drupal 7 guys and

00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:25,789
so we can lead to a lingo a minimal

00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:27,109
drupal 7 when i click on the install

00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:28,520
profile it's going to it's going to

00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:30,230
automatically know if you saw that but

00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:33,170
it changed and showed which platforms

00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:35,900
are available to use with that install

00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:39,140
profile so I've got a platform that we

00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:42,890
have our IRC bot is just a Drupal 7 site

00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:44,569
running the drupalcon but in that's one

00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:48,980
available or I can just use the sandbox

00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:50,750
build if there are language options like

00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:52,190
under open atrium there's a ton of

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:54,980
language options that would show up here

00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,869
and then you can say here's which

00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,010
database server do you want to have it

00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:59,210
live alone just remember when we create

00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:02,349
a platform we had to designate the web

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:04,279
server so that's kind of a done deal so

00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:05,720
it's already going this one already

00:38:04,279 --> 00:38:08,450
lives on 03 Linux so i'm going to pick

00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,799
that for the database you have the

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:11,900
option to go ahead and add other domain

00:38:09,799 --> 00:38:16,309
aliases if you've turned that feature on

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:18,230
and anger now so you add that and you

00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:19,940
can do a its kind of here you can go

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:22,849
into a redirect domain aliases to the

00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:23,990
main domain that's somebody correct me

00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:25,640
if i'm wrong but i think that's what you

00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,559
want to do for SEO a lot of times

00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,940
generally i'm just saying that general

00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:30,100
is

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,680
right redirect we don't want to have

00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,750
both domains matching every page so

00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,000
google says hey you're trying to who do

00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,800
us or something but that's what we

00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,340
usually do is redirect the dub dub dub

00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,990
just to the sub domain because in

00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:46,390
university world there's nothing better

00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:49,540
than seeing dub dub dub dot center for

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,040
leadership development dot UNCC ed I

00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:53,050
mean it's like that's a marketing

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,460
nightmare and that is you know brochure

00:38:53,050 --> 00:39:00,040
site in our world so so we're going to

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:05,110
go and hit save and akers going to spawn

00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:06,280
a task it's going to queue it and it's

00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,660
kind of cool when you create a site

00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,750
you're going to get information on the

00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:14,170
site like the database server you know

00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:15,850
all the stuff we selected and that's it

00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:17,350
we can move on you don't have to sit and

00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:20,620
look at it although it's kind of fun too

00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:24,910
but you can move on and just wait for it

00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:33,220
to install like I didn't 05 when it runs

00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:34,420
we'll take a look at it but servers I

00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,800
know I didn't say I wouldn't show you

00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:41,770
sir while we wait I'll just show you a

00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:45,310
server here whoops basically on the

00:39:41,770 --> 00:39:46,660
server it's pretty simple you're going

00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:50,760
to enter the hostname for the server IP

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:53,770
addresses publicly facing up ease and

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,420
you're going to say hey is this does

00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:58,300
this guy going to run my sequel or not

00:39:55,420 --> 00:40:00,850
and then because i have ssl feature

00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:03,700
turned on and agar i can basically go

00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:05,350
ahead and say you know is this is this

00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:06,730
going to be wet but not only is it going

00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:12,460
to be apache is it can be apache with

00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:14,790
ssl okay looks like according to the

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,890
queue it looks like swear I 205 linux

00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:22,440
UNCC our little test place ran so I

00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,440
should be able to browse to that

00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:43,270
that's running here and this is a game

00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:46,600
while I let that kind of load up there

00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:49,150
the first time you can still on sites

00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:50,710
also view this task log which is I mean

00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,620
this is a huge help especially when

00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:55,360
things go wrong it's pretty easy to when

00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,160
you scroll through you'll see you know

00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:01,990
red backgrounds showing you exactly

00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:11,440
which piece had a problem so so that's

00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:16,930
pretty cool and I just realized

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:20,650
something that's not the proper that is

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,760
not the proper hostname so here's what

00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,440
we're going to do that's not the proper

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,540
eyes thing I made up by this name that

00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,550
hose name actually lives but it's not

00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:32,700
the right one so here's what I'm going

00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:37,420
to do I'm going to go back to that site

00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:44,890
we're going to edit the site and I'm

00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:47,430
going to add a domain alias for the

00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:51,670
right one just so it will work for us

00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:54,180
and we'll make sure yeah make sure

00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:54,180
that's right

00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:06,190
I was thinking I've got too many naming

00:42:03,609 --> 00:42:07,750
conventions in my head so I'm just going

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:12,040
to go ahead and name that as a domain

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:13,780
Aeolus and save it um notice when I

00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:16,570
added that domain Aeolus it's going to

00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:19,990
REE spawn a verify task it's going to

00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:22,720
run through same process again you can't

00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:24,609
control ager as far as or how often it

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,480
runs tasks it's going to try to run up

00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:34,000
to about five things by default 5q two

00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,500
objects at one time every minute and it

00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,890
tries it's best to handle running things

00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:40,359
in the right order and you know handling

00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:42,760
you know getting things done and dealing

00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:45,210
with that so it okay did the verify but

00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,170
you can't change the timing on that and

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:50,200
you can't change the time down to

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:52,270
seconds but I think a minutes pretty

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,490
good i mean you know if you push it out

00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:57,820
and you can wait be patient it's it's

00:42:54,490 --> 00:43:05,500
not too bad so now we can go to Swati

00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:07,090
dev 05 and there's our site it's got a

00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,130
its got a time zone air because i think

00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:12,040
i had this makefile had the date module

00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:15,670
so it wants me to set you know the set

00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:17,980
the time zone once you log in and set it

00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:21,280
at all it'll be good that could be part

00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:23,109
of it install profile also just go ahead

00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:25,180
and do that as part of that take care of

00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:27,790
that not a problem but so we just

00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:31,990
created that now with that you're alive

00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:35,920
it's kind of neat so they want to

00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:39,340
mention a the hosting menu there's

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:42,960
a few few interesting things here so

00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,960
under features under the hosting menu

00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,790
this

00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:49,940
I'm pretty sure when you stall Edgar

00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:52,890
that site cloning is not turned on and

00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,840
site migrations not turned on those are

00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,510
things that I think you kind of want to

00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:00,360
check and activate because that's where

00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,740
the fun begins so let's say that we have

00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:04,200
this is kind of what we're looking at we

00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:05,370
we have a marketing group and they all

00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,880
the time they want they come to us

00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:11,010
technical folks and they say you know we

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:12,930
want to try some neat stuff and that new

00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:14,660
stuff sounds to us like wow that's scary

00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:17,280
you're not doing that production no way

00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,290
um you know it's not content you're

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,540
talking about you want to install you

00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:24,620
know whatever module or whatever make

00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:28,200
changes to themes so what we can do is

00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:30,510
you by using site cloning is go to an

00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,070
existing site and you actually one of

00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,500
the options is you can click clone and

00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:37,200
go ahead and enter a new you have to

00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:39,090
enter a new domain and eager within you

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,740
know a couple minutes whatever it as

00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:42,390
soon as you can it's going to migrate

00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:45,810
make copy not migrate it's gonna make

00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:47,280
copies of the database and take care of

00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,230
all the V host entries and all that so

00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,570
that you have an exact copy of that

00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:52,680
production site at that point Ness it's

00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,150
kinda like a snapshot at that point in

00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:55,920
time so they can work with it I mean I

00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,200
think that happens a lot to all of us

00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:00,630
and something that I think will be

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,940
really beneficial in the actual site

00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:05,340
migration piece the other one that's not

00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:07,860
turned on by default that's that's where

00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,210
you say hey I've got a new platform and

00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:13,770
I'm going to migrate this existing

00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:16,710
Drupal site to a new platform I've done

00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,240
it but my use cases or I'm really

00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:20,040
particular about modules so I haven't

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,100
haven't tried the worst case scenario

00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,120
trying to migrate to a platform that

00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:30,060
completely you know was going to break

00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:33,450
everything if when you when you spawn am

00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:37,200
i great or clone agar does make a backup

00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:38,790
and has and it doesn't erase anything on

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,940
the existing it's just changing pointers

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:43,110
and within the system so your existing

00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:45,900
site was still there until everything

00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:47,220
completely moves over it's not going to

00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,380
get rid of anything you had on the old

00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:51,800
site so so it's pretty good about being

00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,900
transactional and letting you roll back

00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:56,730
and so if things blow up it kind of you

00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,640
know with a migration or any of these

00:45:56,730 --> 00:46:01,279
other upgrades

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,169
it's not going to leave you hang in

00:46:01,279 --> 00:46:09,299
hopefully that's something unforeseen

00:46:04,169 --> 00:46:11,339
goes wrong one thing I haven't explored

00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:17,339
is they've got a checkbox for web

00:46:11,339 --> 00:46:18,900
clusters yeah not sure about that one

00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:21,749
yet because I haven't had time to play

00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:22,890
with that but we don't really in our

00:46:21,749 --> 00:46:24,029
world we're in a department and

00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,059
university so we're not trying to host

00:46:24,029 --> 00:46:30,359
for the whole University so we don't

00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:32,489
really have a need yet for clustering so

00:46:30,359 --> 00:46:34,979
we're okay on that but it'll be

00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:36,209
interesting signup form is kind of again

00:46:34,979 --> 00:46:38,789
if you're trying to use egger as a

00:46:36,209 --> 00:46:40,799
service and you want clients to sign up

00:46:38,789 --> 00:46:44,910
and say hey I want to sigh and then you

00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:46,410
can use you know I don't get into the

00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:48,329
Commerce stuff but you know whatever

00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:52,109
your commerce of choices you can use it

00:46:48,329 --> 00:46:53,249
and and sign people up and and for

00:46:52,109 --> 00:46:57,689
hosting or whatever and there's a

00:46:53,249 --> 00:46:59,519
experimental section here experimental

00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:03,779
meaning that these are features that

00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:06,119
yeah they're newer features the only one

00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:07,859
that I've used so far as ssl support but

00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:11,459
I hear there's people in production

00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:16,529
using engine X support for hosting so I

00:47:11,459 --> 00:47:18,989
know that some of that works there there

00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:24,209
is DNS support since we don't deal with

00:47:18,989 --> 00:47:25,499
DNS haven't used it so but i'm sure a

00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:26,909
lot of folks that have control over

00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:29,849
their dns that might be an interesting

00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:31,979
thing to have so goes and makes the

00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:33,390
entries in bond and update zone file

00:47:31,979 --> 00:47:36,419
that's that's what attempts to do is

00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:37,769
make sure your DNS is set in clients you

00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:40,079
can turn that on if you need to have

00:47:37,769 --> 00:47:42,299
groups of sites for a particular clients

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:49,439
to do things with and not give everybody

00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:51,719
not let everybody be admins as far as

00:47:49,439 --> 00:47:55,189
the queues this is the settings i

00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:58,679
mentioned where you can set hoft and

00:47:55,189 --> 00:48:02,249
drupal cron runs by default here once an

00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:04,979
hour and again this far as i can tell

00:48:02,249 --> 00:48:06,659
this is this is global so once an hour

00:48:04,979 --> 00:48:08,429
is probably fine on a lot of brush your

00:48:06,659 --> 00:48:09,510
websites where all yours mainly looking

00:48:08,429 --> 00:48:12,430
at is up

00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:14,650
search indexing and things like that but

00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:17,890
we have needs we use Drupal for digital

00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:21,310
signage and so we actually need to run

00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:23,950
cron a lot more so to check for updates

00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:27,160
of content things so we'll probably just

00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,869
have Jenkins just execute you know kron4

00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,089
it for that site and things like that

00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:33,390
different times in a task queue this is

00:48:31,089 --> 00:48:36,280
where you can adjust often tasks are run

00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:39,640
like verifies and installs and things

00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:42,849
like that I haven't changed that except

00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,109
for play at this point um you know I'm

00:48:42,849 --> 00:48:46,359
afraid to go less of a minute because I

00:48:44,109 --> 00:48:47,560
you know I just don't know if that would

00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:49,119
be good I don't want too many jobs

00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:51,839
colliding and the keep getting really

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:55,829
big wats waiting on everything I just I

00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:58,839
need to be more patient on that stuff

00:48:55,829 --> 00:49:02,470
but I didn't want to go back to a site

00:48:58,839 --> 00:49:05,290
and you know really the last thing I had

00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:08,950
for any questions is just shoot through

00:49:05,290 --> 00:49:11,079
some of the features on a site um so you

00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:16,000
can run a backup and that takes your

00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:18,160
your database and your content all your

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,020
you know basically your site's default

00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,329
files follow it well not your size

00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:24,339
default but your files folder and that

00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:27,130
Drupal site wraps all that up in a

00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:29,079
backup that it's kind of an acre backup

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:33,490
it's a backup that Agron understands and

00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:37,690
can restore from one of the issues that

00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:40,329
we have right now is that that out of

00:49:37,690 --> 00:49:42,700
the box egger does backups only when you

00:49:40,329 --> 00:49:44,800
go push the button and I don't know what

00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,750
you guys but I'm not real good about

00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,180
remembering to go push buttons on every

00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:53,050
website every day and making sure it

00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:54,640
works so so we're setting up some of the

00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,670
standard scripts we use to back up the

00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:59,079
my sequel database and kind of only

00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:00,579
using the Aegir back up right now just

00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:02,349
to do a backup in case we're about to do

00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:04,390
some stuff and just that that we may

00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:07,180
want to restore to a server you

00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:09,339
know so if you're migrating to a New

00:50:07,180 --> 00:50:11,619
Ager install existing site sheet it's a

00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:13,540
good you know it might be a great one to

00:50:11,619 --> 00:50:15,670
use you know use that back up so that

00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:19,240
you can restore a little easier on a New

00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:21,430
Ager site and you can delete existing

00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:22,390
backups and you can it's cool when you

00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:25,720
do a backup you can

00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:27,640
name the backup so you got some options

00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,109
here just do a description kind like

00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:33,220
back up in my gray to me as far as that

00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:34,359
feel where you can name them clone we

00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:38,559
talked about that that just would clone

00:50:34,359 --> 00:50:43,900
a copy of this site to another site i'm

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:46,559
using the same platform before you can I

00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:49,390
don't even think is delete on here yeah

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,940
so you don't see delete site listed here

00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:55,319
and that's because you have to disable a

00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:57,130
site before you can delete a site for

00:50:55,319 --> 00:51:00,730
probably some technical reasons but also

00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:03,430
just good form you know I don't want to

00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:04,630
have easy delete buttons and if I have

00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:05,710
to disable that gives me just another

00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:09,789
opportunity to think about what I'm

00:51:05,710 --> 00:51:11,170
doing so so you do so you'll run the

00:51:09,789 --> 00:51:13,990
disabled job and then you'll get a

00:51:11,170 --> 00:51:17,470
delete task option reset password

00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:20,589
actually just performs a standard Drupal

00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:23,920
password reset it will email the site

00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:26,980
contact listed on this blewett's listen

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,660
here well it's whatever user the client

00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,900
was whatever that pet you know for the

00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:33,549
in that egg or whatever the clients

00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,589
email address is it'll fire off a

00:51:33,549 --> 00:51:38,049
one-time reset link just a standard

00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:40,299
Drupal thing and let you reset the

00:51:38,049 --> 00:51:43,509
password kind of handy if someone

00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:46,299
forgets their password or whatever you

00:51:43,509 --> 00:51:47,859
can do that migrate is really that's

00:51:46,299 --> 00:51:49,210
where that's really one of the big

00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:51,789
reasons we really want to use this is

00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:55,180
just to make our upgrades a lot easier

00:51:51,789 --> 00:52:00,039
in the process more methodical then I

00:51:55,180 --> 00:52:02,289
mean I love doing drush update you know

00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,599
doing doing I mean I think it's magical

00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:06,579
when you typed Russians in commands it

00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,680
pulls down updates and updates it and it

00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:10,720
does the you know the update BB for you

00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:15,220
clear the cache and everything works and

00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:17,019
it's awesome but you know that can be a

00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:18,519
little scary because you're you know

00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:20,109
you're tangling with stuff right there

00:52:18,519 --> 00:52:22,869
in you know especially if you're in a

00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:25,000
lifetime een that's definitely no no but

00:52:22,869 --> 00:52:26,710
I feel like this gives a little more

00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:32,559
process and lets us do things where we

00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:34,240
can easily roll back and and so and in

00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,589
the last one year was restore and that's

00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,940
just restoring your back of a core

00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:42,670
so that's that's all I had really if you

00:52:39,940 --> 00:53:01,390
guys have questions or discussion items

00:52:42,670 --> 00:53:04,589
feel free to jump in you know we haven't

00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:08,069
we haven't set up our cert yet I'll

00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:13,920
repeat the question I'll repeat that the

00:53:08,069 --> 00:53:16,900
question was how does the ssl work with

00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,180
agar believe what you're getting at how

00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,829
does ssl work and wild cards and setting

00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:25,869
them up ahead of time so that egger can

00:53:20,829 --> 00:53:27,400
deal use those certs so i have it set up

00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:30,239
our wild card yet because these are all

00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:32,559
test servers at this point we have used

00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:35,829
scott here on the front row scott and i

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,509
have used the wildcard search for test

00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:39,339
sites already they work great because

00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:42,099
we're using ldap with ad and we still

00:53:39,339 --> 00:53:48,219
want to encrypt you know user auth you

00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:49,809
know via that yeah and so but on the i

00:53:48,219 --> 00:53:51,489
know their document on and i don't want

00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,839
to spend time searching for it but on

00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:54,640
that community site there's a document

00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:56,529
on where to set up your certs where to

00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,989
put them and all that where ager will

00:53:56,529 --> 00:54:01,719
find them it'll basically basically if

00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:04,390
you put them in the right folder agar

00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:07,779
will find the certs and it will go ahead

00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:10,420
and when you set up a new side and you

00:54:07,779 --> 00:54:11,380
check ssl it'll say which certain do you

00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:13,210
want to use do you want to use an

00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:15,549
existing one or do you want us to create

00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:18,279
a new one so you could create a a you

00:54:15,549 --> 00:54:21,549
know a new start for each site or we

00:54:18,279 --> 00:54:22,690
just created a cert for now just for you

00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:25,180
know group of test sites we're using

00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:28,450
just to keep it simple is that does that

00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,950
help a little bit but so that's good so

00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:31,690
we kind of needed that I was hoping my

00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:33,849
breath when we first has to that and

00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:36,029
help that functionality worked pretty

00:54:33,849 --> 00:54:36,029
well

00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:10,500
out of the box yes it does out of the

00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:13,410
box the question was it's fast CGI

00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:15,690
compatible with Hagar basically and out

00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,790
of a box I don't believe it is without

00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:25,170
some modifications but someone has done

00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:28,680
that work Omega 8cc that is a provider

00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:30,390
of agar hosting and on github that would

00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,790
by the same name they've got an account

00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:34,290
and they've got a system it's copper

00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:36,900
lose called their Barracuda system I've

00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,880
never used it I don't haven't gone there

00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,150
so I you know it's worth exploring and

00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,550
checking out but they have a system that

00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,570
uses you know what because they're doing

00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:47,310
hosti they're doing hosting chair

00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:50,370
hosting I mean so they need more

00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:51,600
security on that side of it so so

00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:52,650
they've got some of that it's worth

00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,350
checking out cuz you probably could

00:55:52,650 --> 00:56:04,400
either use or you know take the pieces

00:55:55,350 --> 00:56:04,400
that you want out of that yeah

00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:20,530
yeah i don't i don't think anger out of

00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:22,060
the box of course other databases just

00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:26,170
because and i say that only because it

00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:27,880
doesn't present me with others now i'm

00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,650
not saying i'm sure other people have

00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:31,930
used other ones or experience you know

00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,270
the sequel light would be one that would

00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:38,079
be kind of fun to play with with seven

00:56:34,270 --> 00:56:40,570
and things like that but because you can

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,710
like on the servers section you know i

00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,839
mentioned that you can actually write

00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:46,390
you know extend agarran to recognize

00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,510
other services and they've got a way to

00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:50,710
handle that i would think that if you

00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:51,820
could do it or if someone else has

00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:53,440
already done it there's they're

00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:55,270
certainly ways you can have it work with

00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,510
other databases but i don't i don't

00:56:55,270 --> 00:56:59,920
think it does only only based on I'm

00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:01,240
answer now only based on the fact that I

00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,420
haven't seen it present any other

00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,170
options for that not that you know I'm

00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,030
not saying you couldn't go to the

00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:08,380
community side although there was one

00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:09,940
Sunday where I literally read every

00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,410
piece of documentation on that community

00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:13,060
site because I just felt like I needed

00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:17,640
to get it all at one time there's a

00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:17,640
quick oh you know dive into a ger so

00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:29,170
anything else or their questions alright

00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:33,030
cool well I appreciate it everybody

00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:33,030

00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,030

what about this I can help the like it

00:57:54,680 --> 00:58:00,280
we have the same problem ethical to do

00:57:57,349 --> 00:58:00,280
dates you gave me I

00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:05,580
let's put the word out

00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:14,680

00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:22,690

00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:27,850
you do across all your devices HP Slate

00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:30,520
and webos HP as a service leader in

00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:32,530
cloud computing all we do is hosting

00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,540
computing to us the cloud is just the

00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:35,560
next generation of hosting and if

00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:37,540
someone who's been in the hosting

00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:39,550
industry for 12 years we feel we're in a

00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,840
unique position to really help bring

00:58:39,550 --> 00:58:42,850
these two worlds together these

00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,040
different sense of technologies and to

00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:47,440
help companies embrace this new world in

00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,750
this great new tool that allows faster

00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,790
innovation not only is it about us being
