00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:27,240
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:31,099
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

make these videos possible Mic Check

00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:36,719
cool ready to go alright well hey thanks

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,730
everyone for coming to triple camp South

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,210
Carolina my name is Jason hibbitts i

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,430
work at red hat and my main function my

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:47,129
main duty is to work on open source com

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,950
I'm the project manager for that which

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:51,570
means I do lots of stuff if the site

00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:55,230
goes down they call me luckily that

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,480
doesn't happen very often so the core

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:01,140
functionalities of being a project

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,789
manager I work with aquia who's our who

00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:06,240
hosts our site and does our support so I

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:07,799
manage that relationship I look for a

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,979
lot of content that goes on the site and

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,830
I manage the community now I don't all

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,439
do all the three of those that well so

00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,759
it's a work in progress now today we're

00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,439
going to talk about open source com

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,420
because I do that every day it's kind of

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,330
the case study for creating online

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,640
community the open source way so if you

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:30,659
haven't been to the site the high level

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,150
stuff it's where we're looking at open

00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,520
source beyond technology and for a lot

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:37,200
of folks particularly it conferences

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,619
like this where you are already

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,000
understand open source I like to say

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:43,470
that this is just another tool for your

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,970
tool belt when somebody doesn't

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,030
understand open source this is a

00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:49,890
resource that you can send them to I

00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:52,560
like to say that's a translation tool so

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,060
there may be folks in other industries

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,969
like the auto industry that's using

00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,530
collaboration but they don't call it

00:01:55,969 --> 00:02:01,439
open source so we kind of translate some

00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:02,700
of that terminology just because I never

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,350
know how I'm going to have live internet

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,009
or I'm going to have problems with it

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,229
this is our home page and we're talking

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,770
about the open-source way across six

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:17,150
major topics business

00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:19,460
okay Shin government health law and life

00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:20,960
and on the back and you'll see here a

00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:23,960
little bit those are all organic groups

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:26,210
on the drupal side life is kind of the

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:28,220
hodgepodge so it doesn't fit in the the

00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,930
first five it goes into our life

00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,710
community and we're talking about music

00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:38,540
video sustainable energy all those types

00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:40,850
of things and so I'm going to use this

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,410
term the open-source way throughout the

00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:43,730
presentation and really it's just a

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,680
collection of all this terminology that

00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,170
we're familiar with from the open-source

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,660
development model its transparency its

00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:52,700
sharing its rapid prototyping all the

00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,650
things that have made the development

00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:56,090
model successful for open-source apply

00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,470
to those different areas in business

00:02:56,090 --> 00:03:02,630
education so forth one of my favorite

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,100
ones is I like to talk about failing

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,210
faster it's kind of a different

00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:10,400
iteration of rapid prototyping and the

00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:12,860
other part of this is to succeed faster

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,490
as well right so you have to be willing

00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,600
to try new things and some of them are

00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,800
going to fail and you're going to learn

00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,530
from those so that you can figure out

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,959
what works we do this a lot in online

00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:26,030
community building and I'm going to go

00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:27,980
into a lot more details on some of the

00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:29,720
things that we've tried and have not

00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,430
been successful with and some of the

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:35,030
things that we're continuing to to do

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,830
that we're successful the other one did

00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:39,170
a kind of large overarching principle

00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,680
that we we go with is defaulting to open

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,480
this is more of a red hat it's part of

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,600
our Red Hat DNA just kind of translates

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,400
really well over to the open-source way

00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,590
where if we have a question of should we

00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,140
should be open up this process or should

00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:56,390
we should we share out our publishing

00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:57,890
calendar the answer would be yes to fall

00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:02,390
to open and then talk about the

00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:04,520
consequences and risks of doing that all

00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:07,880
right so open source com how did it go

00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:11,840
from an idea to a website to an online

00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,810
community we started it we launched the

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,940
website January 25th for 2010 so about a

00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:21,440
year and a half ago we spend about six

00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:23,419
months building the site gathering some

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,570
initial content and doing some initial

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:30,870
community building internally

00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:32,580
we if you're going to do any sort of

00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,880
community building whether it's in real

00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:38,250
life or online you should always ask the

00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,980
question do I build my own community or

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:44,130
should I join an existing one this is

00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,570
part of the due diligence piece we did

00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,180
our research and we found that nobody

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,070
else that we could find was talking

00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,530
about the open-source way across those

00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:54,420
different business education government

00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:56,490
communities there were kind of little

00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:59,730
pieces of it here and there but not as a

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,760
collection and so we made the decision

00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,380
to build a community and you can

00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,390
probably think of different examples in

00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:11,580
your own world where it's kind of a

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:13,590
build versus join what we needed I call

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,120
it the three C's we needed content

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:16,410
management system because on the next

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,100
slide you'll see that we believe content

00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,750
is king we needed content to going that

00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,390
content management system and we also

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:29,490
needed a community as you know there are

00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,430
numerous content management systems out

00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,750
there both proprietary and open source

00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,880
the first rule for us is that it had to

00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,260
be open source we looked at all the

00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:41,520
different things we looked at joomla

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,630
wordpress plone and drupal where they're

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,870
kind of our top four that we

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:50,970
investigated but once we made that

00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:52,620
decision I skip the slide no yeah once

00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,390
we made that decision based on these

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,760
things we chose akhiya to host our

00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:01,590
Drupal and a lot of the things that we

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,830
looked at that set it apart from the

00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,150
other content management systems

00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:07,830
WordPress if we wanted to fire up a blog

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,570
we probably would have picked that and

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,450
gone out the gate and couple weeks and

00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:14,430
that would've been all she wrote but we

00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,530
wanted to build a community we were very

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,110
conscious of that and drupal provided a

00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:21,810
lot of the modules and other pieces that

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,940
we needed to build that community or

00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,130
build our community we also looked at

00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,260
job trends so a lot of people don't

00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:30,810
consider this but we found a website

00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:32,490
indeed.com and you can type you can go

00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,770
there and type in almost any keyword we

00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:36,990
typed in WordPress we typed in Drupal we

00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,650
look at all the things of different

00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:40,650
management systems

00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:42,970
and drupal was kind of up into the right

00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,600
meaning there was a lot of demand for

00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:49,030
drupal jobs and I was at Tupac on

00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,889
earlier seer in Chicago and there were

00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:52,690
the buzz was that there are so many

00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:54,570
Drupal jobs that are needed that there's

00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:58,600
not enough Drupal expertise to fill them

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:59,979
so if you're looking for a job or know

00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,509
somebody does I would recommend that

00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:03,910
they might want to get into Drupal so

00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,949
that's a great thing we also we wanted

00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:07,120
to focus on the content and hoe and

00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:10,509
manage to the community we didn't want

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,020
to focus on managing Drupal so we were

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:14,620
looking for folks to host our

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,539
application and also do the

00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,690
administration for us we're learning as

00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:22,510
we go but we we wanted to focus on our

00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:25,380
mission which is on promoting the

00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:28,510
open-source way as I alluded to earlier

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:29,800
content is king we wouldn't have a

00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,180
community without the content that we

00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,740
produce in the content that they help us

00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:37,270
produce and the content that they

00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:40,330
comment on and interact with so I'll go

00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:43,449
back in time this was about six months

00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:45,099
before we went live on the web we kicked

00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,580
off an internal project team probably

00:07:45,099 --> 00:07:50,380
about six to eight folks within a red

00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:52,000
hat that were responsible for you know

00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:54,520
defining what the website was going to

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,010
be defining what we the community what

00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:00,130
we wanted the community to look like and

00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:02,440
basically our overarching goal is to

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,860
attract new users to open source so

00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,449
again using that translation tool of hey

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,550
you're doing stuff you're doing

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:11,289
collaboration using transparency by the

00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,940
way that's the open-source way so kind

00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:16,090
of making that bridge and bridging the

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:17,289
gap we conducted an internal pilot we

00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,889
got about a hundred Red Hatters

00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:23,409
worldwide to help us out and we had

00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,940
about an eight week period where we

00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:29,740
would give them a new task every week

00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:32,260
that ranged from reviewing our terms and

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,849
conditions of the website very boring

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,919
stuff but very important because they

00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,870
actually helped us figure out a couple

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,620
things and that we modified before we

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,300
put that out to our users they helped us

00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,040
review our wireframes and they help us

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,740
do kind of the UI and the usability

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,520
testing they helped us do test the site

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,370
functionality the first version of it

00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,440
over

00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:59,170
around the December time frame before we

00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,420
launched and we had a kind of an

00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:04,250
invite-only external pilot so we we had

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,529
some trusted folks we let into the site

00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:08,740
to see what it was and mostly because we

00:09:06,529 --> 00:09:11,630
wanted to kind of have a spark and have

00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:16,370
you know have that kind of launch moment

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:19,400
and then on Jo 25th last year we open it

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,640
up to the world and we have open source

00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:26,210
com so what are we doing to build online

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:28,910
community oh I like to kind of classify

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:31,190
it as a three-pronged approach here one

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:32,630
focused on social media which is a great

00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:33,920
tool for us to get the word out on our

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,700
content and also to interact with our

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,140
users I call it old-school ways and I'll

00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,540
go into more of those details and also

00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:45,380
events like paz con pasta con and

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:50,930
healthy son expects so we're on social

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:53,770
media on all these great outlets twitter

00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,820
by far is the most successful one for us

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:59,900
i'll show you some numbers here in a

00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,850
minute and then on the site itself we

00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:03,410
have the little share buttons that every

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,910
other website has we can share the

00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:08,390
content out and that seemed to be really

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:10,060
successful for us so on Twitter we

00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:13,700
recently broke four thousand followers

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:17,029
we tried to be very conscious of kind of

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,290
best practices so we we actually have

00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,230
two accounts we have an open source

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:23,870
feeds account which is basically an RSS

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,490
feed of all of our content we don't

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:28,220
really manage it some people follow it

00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:30,110
we just publish out every time we have a

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,510
new article it goes it's pretty it's

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,130
kind of automated but we spend a lot of

00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,220
time and resources on the open source

00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:40,070
away account and we promote other

00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,690
people's content we interact with the

00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,310
follow friday stuff so we promote our

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:46,459
users via twitter and we actually

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:50,240
interact and engage so one example is

00:10:46,459 --> 00:10:52,279
this week a designer pingas and said hey

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,900
why isn't open source com using open

00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,020
fonts on their website and I was like

00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:59,480
well why don't I ask what we should use

00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:00,950
and so I responded to this person and I

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,240
said well what would you use and they

00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,430
responded back and said I'd use you know

00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,660
something neato something and so I like

00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,900
all right well I'll take that back to my

00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:12,560
19 and figure out if we can use an open

00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,910
sore spot on our website so like

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,310
instances like that where we're actually

00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:18,950
getting feedback and interacting with

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:22,220
the users Facebook we actually haven't

00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:25,640
really figured out yet particularly for

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:29,170
our for our audience we're almost at

00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,940
2,000 likes on our page it's mostly a

00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:34,730
content stream of our you know a stream

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:36,410
of our content but what what we were

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,000
starting to see is if you actually go to

00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:39,770
our Facebook page today we are here at

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,330
this event we took a bunch of pictures

00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:44,030
and we posted all those pictures online

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,220
on our Facebook page so we're trying

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:49,010
things like that to see if we can get

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:51,320
that usage I think we got about 10 to 15

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,060
more likes sense that we posted the

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,320
pictures from this event so we're

00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,140
starting to see maybe that's a little

00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,810
bit of traction we're also looking at it

00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:01,370
to UM to promote events so they already

00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:04,310
have a Facebook has an events module

00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,900
that you can go in and type stuff in and

00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,510
we're going to promote our webcast via

00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:10,250
that mechanism and also see if we can

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,360
promote other like real events something

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,100
like this like hey we're going to be at

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,240
Southeast Linux best let us know if

00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,000
you're going to be there and you know

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,820
find us at the booth kind of thing and

00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,770
then a really phenomenal resource that

00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:25,310
doesn't get enough attention is our

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:28,310
Flickr page for the most part most of

00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:29,840
the images in this slideshow are created

00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,950
by our design team internally at Red Hat

00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:34,610
and they're all released under Creative

00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:37,460
Commons license which means you can

00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:38,990
reuse the images you can repurpose the

00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,870
images as long as you give us credit for

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:45,500
it and if you go to our Flickr page it's

00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,970
just hundreds of images that other

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:51,920
people are starting to use in other

00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:54,500
publications which is really cool the

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:56,510
old school way we were very lucky to

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,250
inherit a very large email list from a

00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,830
former Red Hat property called Red Hat

00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:03,500
magazine we had about 400,000 people on

00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:06,800
that list so when we launched on January

00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:09,230
25th we hit up that list and got a very

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,280
large spike in traffic and Drupal did

00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,900
very well from a performance perspective

00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:18,920
and we continue to nurture that mailing

00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:21,050
list we were doing it on a monthly basis

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:23,480
our content volume is increased so we're

00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,060
actually in the middle of doing a split

00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,620
test where we're doing we took half the

00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,990
list and we're a mailing them every

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:31,430
other week and we took the other half

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:33,800
the list and we're emailing them weekly

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:35,380
so we're going to see we're going to

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,480
monitor our traffic and use the tools

00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:41,630
that were to track those things and see

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,220
which one was more effective we're

00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,750
basically the weekly one we're not doing

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:46,970
it's not just a dump of our all of our

00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:48,860
content it's the top five articles from

00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,329
that week so we're kind of we're kind of

00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:55,399
giving them the things that we think

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:57,410
they might like and as any user as is

00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,430
the way I look at my stuff I think most

00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:59,570
people do this you just kind of when you

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,740
get those emails you kind of scan the

00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:02,540
headlines and click on what's

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,510
interesting so I think most people kind

00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,880
of react in that same way we're also on

00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:10,370
IRC we is basically kind of a back

00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:14,269
channel to ask questions or on freenode

00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:16,190
open source pound open source com most

00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:19,970
of the admins or channel moderators are

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:22,160
there and you know come and say hi to us

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:24,199
we have a lot of fun there it's actually

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,550
kind of quiet but a lot of people poke

00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:27,529
in and ask questions and things like

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,480
that and we also use the kind of

00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:32,480
traditional community mailing list we

00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:35,300
have gone one that's site-wide OSD c

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,310
dash list and anybody can join that and

00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:38,870
we'll toss out questions like hey we're

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,570
thinking about changing how comments are

00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:44,269
done what do you think we just have

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,760
earlier out allude to but we launched it

00:14:44,269 --> 00:14:48,860
points and badge system and we released

00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,170
our first draft of that to that audience

00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,880
and got feedback and we're able was able

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,500
to actually make the points and badge

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,779
system better so I'll talk about that a

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,310
little bit and then some of our

00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,980
individual communities have their own

00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:03,680
list the education the open education

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:06,680
community is great they they have

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,480
offline conversations they interact they

00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,610
are helping others find content and

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,680
they're actually helping with kind of

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,019
the open education movement through that

00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,519
mailing list so that's a really popular

00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:20,660
one if you're interested in education

00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:23,300
and then our kind of already mentioned

00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:25,160
this but also with with events so we

00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:28,519
look at different events that we could

00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:31,819
attend see where new audit work and we

00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,780
can reach new audiences where we can

00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,340
reach audiences

00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,750
like you where were somewhat familiar

00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,660
with open source but you may not know

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:43,370
about open source com and then we do a

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:44,900
monthly webcast and we focus on for now

00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,670
we've been focused mostly on business

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,190
like kind of authors and things like

00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:51,110
that we brought in general Hugh Shelton

00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,630
former general who Shelton from the

00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:54,770
Joint Chiefs of Staff talking about open

00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:58,540
leadership and leadership in the

00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:01,730
military we've had Charlene Li who wrote

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:05,060
co-wrote ground swell and she also wrote

00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:08,030
a book called open leadership and coming

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,070
up this month we've got Daniel pink now

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:11,570
who's that who's another author one of

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:14,000
my favorite ones that we did recently

00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,910
was a kind of a tutorial on open-source

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,210
music and we have a wet a guy who works

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:22,130
at Red Hat who in his spare time knows

00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:23,630
all these great tools to do open music

00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:25,670
with and that's like recording your

00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,560
music and manipulating it and producing

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:29,300
it and so we've got a webcast where he

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,430
walks you through all those tools and

00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:35,450
shows you how to do it really great

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:37,480
stuff and then community person is the

00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:41,060
best thing this is actually a shot from

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:45,020
drupalcon Chicago where they rented out

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:47,270
the one of the museum's there where the

00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,430
t-rex actually the t-rex is on the other

00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,630
end of this picture but you know just

00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,970
meeting people and tell them about the

00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:54,920
site and this is how I get to meet a lot

00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:56,360
of authors that that right for us and I

00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,710
finally get to go to event and like oh

00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,870
that's what you look like thanks for you

00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:03,350
know doing those articles for us so

00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:04,550
that's always fun all right and then I'm

00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,870
going to transition here and get a

00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:08,360
little bit more to the Drupal stuff for

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:09,880
you how do we engage people once they

00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,210
get to the site so we do all this work

00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:15,260
emails Twitter to get people there so

00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:16,790
what are we get what are they going to

00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,840
do when they get there well one we hope

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:21,380
they read our stuff because that's

00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:23,540
really what we want but um this is a

00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:27,550
screenshot of a poll that we throw up

00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:30,770
and just a couple highlights here I

00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:34,340
mentioned the share buttons so we've got

00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:36,740
the the five most popular ones for us we

00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,630
actually did when we deployed that we

00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:41,300
did a lot of research on what our users

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:42,890
were already doing so we had the the

00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:45,350
first version of the share button that

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:46,160
had like 200 options under it nobody

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,450
clicked on it

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,670
I wonder why because there was too many

00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,460
options so we looked at we looked at our

00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,920
data we said well which what are people

00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,340
using already Twitter obviously was a

00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,770
big one Facebook but they're also using

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,810
reddit and stumble upon and so we threw

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,310
we just said here's the top 5 and we

00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:06,350
still have that other share button at

00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:09,080
the bottom still not getting a lot of

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:11,810
clicks so we're conscious of what our

00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,500
users are doing polls are a great way to

00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:16,910
engage our users it's really simple they

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,800
fill if they click one button and they

00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:21,530
hit boat and it's done and they're

00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:24,350
engaged we're actually we try to tie

00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:26,270
that back to some existing content or a

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,970
strategy that we're recently discussing

00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:30,440
is trying to create future content out

00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:34,010
of based on the information from the

00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,610
polls we get that one sometime last

00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:39,230
summer one of our authors basically put

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,610
up a poll that said why do you still

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,050
have an iphone and he gave a couple

00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:44,600
options and then he wrote an article

00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:46,160
about open source phones and why you

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,930
know basically like androids and things

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,370
like that of you know why do you really

00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:51,260
still need an iphone they're open

00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:55,340
alternatives and he referenced the poll

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:58,220
data that he collected also just like

00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:59,840
any other two tour periodical on the

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,480
website we allow people to comment

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:04,010
that's a great way to get discussions

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,510
going one of the things that we do like

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,670
to do is to create conversation on the

00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,530
site we want to be seen as thought

00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:11,870
leaders and open source and thought

00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:14,540
leaders promoting the open source way

00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:18,560
and getting users to talk about it on

00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:20,530
the site is a great way for us some of

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,610
the barriers that we have is actually

00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:24,620
contributing to the site so we still

00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:27,410
haven't really figured this out we have

00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,110
we outline how folks can create images

00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:31,880
and submit them to us and we outline how

00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:34,340
folks can write blogs for us and right

00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,440
post but it's not an easy task right

00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:38,210
because not everybody can write and or

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:40,490
not everybody can write well and not

00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,770
everyone can write to the audience that

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,200
we're trying to reach so those are

00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:49,460
really big barriers for us but we're

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,990
still trying to figure it out when we

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,870
had our one year anniversary earlier

00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:55,670
this year in january instead of kind of

00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,710
Tooting our own horn and saying hey

00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:59,220
we're one years old we made it i always

00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:00,960
make the reference if you have kids

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,520
and you made it to one year it's not

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,789
about the kid it's about you making it

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,770
the year as parents so so we said

00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:11,400
instead of focusing on us let's focus on

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,020
our community so we did we did two

00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,000
things we we launched a contributor

00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,120
spotlight and we also simultaneously

00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,710
launched a points and badge system and

00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:22,470
I'll talk about some of the modules that

00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:24,330
we use there momentarily but this

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:28,260
contributor spotlight is on the home

00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:30,780
page of our site we select a user right

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:33,720
now we're doing it every two weeks we

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,770
talk about them we let them you know if

00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,419
they want to highlight something that

00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:38,460
they're working on personally will let

00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:39,419
them do that and we also try to tie it

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,370
back to something that they've

00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:42,960
contributed on the site whether it's a

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:46,020
really good comment or an article that

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,270
they've written and as I mentioned

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,030
earlier the points and badges we we came

00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,370
up with kind of the rules so to speak so

00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,380
how would you earn points how do you get

00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:56,789
points those type of things we release

00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,679
that early to our community and said

00:20:56,789 --> 00:21:01,860
here's what we're thinking what do you

00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,289
think and we got some great feedback how

00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,520
our points in batch system works you

00:21:04,289 --> 00:21:08,280
have to be logged in in order to

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,890
accumulate points if you write an

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,159
article you get 30 points if you produce

00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:16,830
a poll you get 15 points if you make a

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,110
comment you get five points and if you

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:22,530
do anything that's clickable like voting

00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:25,679
or thumbs up on the comments you get one

00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:27,030
point what the other thing that we're

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,919
trying to do I haven't quite gotten to

00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:30,240
it yet is if somebody clicks on the

00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:31,350
share buttons we want to give them a

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,960
point for that so I think there's going

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:35,309
to be some some sort of scripting

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,919
involved so I've got to figure that

00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:41,250
piece out or my friends at aqua have to

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:44,130
figure that piece out for us so this is

00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:45,809
really popular we actually saw our our

00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,940
page views jump up after we launched

00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:51,179
this so we get more folks logging into

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,250
the system and people like points like

00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:55,980
we're not giving them anything like

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,049
there's no prize at the end but people

00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:00,179
love getting points we made four

00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:02,130
different classifications when you log

00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:05,549
in when you register your account with

00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:08,909
the site you become a newbie once you

00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:12,870
get 10 points here an open community

00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:15,720
member and then once you get a

00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:17,910
it gets 30 points you'll be our open

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,430
enthusiast and if you get over 100

00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:25,680
you're a rock star everyone loves to be

00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:28,020
a rock star we um we kind of figured out

00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,210
what those levels were based on kind of

00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,270
participation so getting ten points is

00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,890
fairly easy on the site you can do you

00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,340
can produce two comments or you can do a

00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:41,400
comment and rate and vote on things to

00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,750
get those points at the same time we

00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,510
actually get hit with a lot of spam

00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:51,720
believe it or not mollem is our friend

00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:53,760
but mom doesn't catch everything so we

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,230
we looked at our data again and we

00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,570
realized that we were getting hit with

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,860
something that's called a black hat SEO

00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,110
so where people register with your site

00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:03,179
so that they can get a link on your own

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:04,860
there be a user profile page basically

00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:09,780
for google rankings and things like that

00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:11,370
so what we did is we if you are not a

00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:13,710
community member so if you don't have

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,570
the 10 points your user profile doesn't

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:18,270
display your website in your biography

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,100
on the user profile once you get 10

00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:22,350
points then we will show that

00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,030
information so i don't know if it's

00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,650
impacted the spammers i've seen one or

00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:29,309
two sneak through that I've had to

00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,690
manually take care of but i think it's

00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:32,520
preventing some of the black hat SEO

00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,059
that at least at the levels that we were

00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:40,230
seeing which was at some point 10 to 15

00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:43,860
an hour and still tuple was doing great

00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:45,330
as from a performance perspective so

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:48,690
what do we what are we thinking about as

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,940
far as a engagement on the site image I

00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:53,280
kind of hinted earlier that all of our

00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,990
we call them channels / communities

00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,559
they're basically organic groups on the

00:23:54,990 --> 00:24:00,480
backend and so we control who is part of

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,370
those groups right now and we're

00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,940
considering just opening it up and

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:06,840
saying what a big join join this group

00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,950
what we need to do is figure out what

00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,640
they would do once they join the group

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:15,900
so if you're familiar with geo Malik

00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,520
group groups to blorg its you can go

00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,020
find any group you can join it you and

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,610
there's things you can do there so we

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,509
need to figure out what things people

00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,369
would do on our site with you

00:24:22,509 --> 00:24:26,979
organic groups as the back end so I'm

00:24:24,369 --> 00:24:28,179
open to suggestions we're also looking

00:24:26,979 --> 00:24:31,899
to kind of remove some of the barriers

00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:33,399
to logging in currently we have the

00:24:31,899 --> 00:24:38,409
straight registration form that comes

00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:39,789
with Drupal and we integrated open ID so

00:24:38,409 --> 00:24:41,289
we're considering you know doing the

00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:43,389
facebook and twitter login just to kind

00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:45,940
of again lower the barriers to

00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:47,259
participation and then also your ideas

00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,690
right we're always looking for your

00:24:47,259 --> 00:24:51,279
ideas we're asking folks what we're

00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:52,690
looking at other drupal communities are

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,349
doing what other sites are doing with

00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:58,179
drupal and we as the open-source way

00:24:56,349 --> 00:25:01,869
we're sharing that information and we

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,879
are going to borrow many ideas okay so

00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:07,419
here are some of the specific modules

00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:10,739
that we have in use on the site now

00:25:07,419 --> 00:25:13,089
we're using apache solr for search

00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:15,669
mollem as i mentioned to protect

00:25:13,089 --> 00:25:17,889
ourselves from spam organic groups to

00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:21,429
basically bucket our content in our

00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:23,379
communities user points to do the point

00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:28,209
accumulation and user badges to do the

00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:29,649
display of the badges we use trigger

00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:33,159
there's a trigger module that we use

00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:34,929
that is basically behind the scenes for

00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,419
the badges and so that when you get

00:25:34,929 --> 00:25:39,909
those different point levels the trigger

00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:42,449
events bumped you up from open

00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:44,859
enthusiasts to Rockstar things like that

00:25:42,449 --> 00:25:46,449
we do a little bit of integration with

00:25:44,859 --> 00:25:48,779
Twitter on the site so we'll have our

00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:54,039
latest tweet will show up on this little

00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:55,989
block over here and then we have a vote

00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:57,399
up boat down module on the comments we

00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:59,769
call them thumbs so you can thumb up

00:25:57,399 --> 00:26:04,959
thumb down in the open source world it's

00:25:59,769 --> 00:26:09,629
also plus 1 or minus 1 and so I've

00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:12,190
always forget to tell you I'm not like a

00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:14,919
drupal module guy like I don't go

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:16,509
install modules I rely right now on aqua

00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:18,309
to help us make some other selection as

00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:20,709
you are probably well aware there are a

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:22,419
ton of modules out there so we really

00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:25,419
rely on them to kind of guide us down

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:27,190
which ones we should use and which ones

00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:28,299
they would recommend that we do for you

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,769
know whatever goal we're trying to

00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:36,400
achieve I am mostly a content and admin

00:26:32,769 --> 00:26:37,600
on the site so I'm i do not know various

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,250
if it's about the details as the

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,810
previous session that was in where

00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,740
they're giving you all the tips and

00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:46,870
tricks of the modules a great resource

00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:50,350
and actually if you were at the keynote

00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:52,870
last night spot mentioned this it's an

00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:55,240
open source hand book called the

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:58,120
open-source way handbook it was built by

00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,520
the community and one of the things that

00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,170
I like to highlight is how do you

00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,690
loosely organized a community there's a

00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:07,000
whole chapter on that one of the things

00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:09,550
that they recommend is to make a list of

00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,460
to do things things that need to be done

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:14,980
for your community and you know be very

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,420
transparent about it but then also start

00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,530
putting names against it so if you've

00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:19,240
got somebody in your community that's

00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,620
working on something put their name

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,350
against it it kind of creates a little

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:27,300
bit of accountability for both for them

00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:30,130
and for you and we've tried this on our

00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,600
on our life channel our life community

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,040
where we said here are the topics were

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,740
interested in we're looking for writers

00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,390
and we made a little bit of progress

00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,330
with that but it didn't work out too

00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:41,770
well in this case so we may not have

00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:44,980
done it right we may need to try that a

00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,360
different version of that but like I

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,040
said writing is hard so we may want to

00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:49,540
think about how what kind of other

00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,980
things we can do to make a list so that

00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:55,210
we can get some participation so so

00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,980
what's next for you folks on the

00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:00,340
audience if you haven't been to the site

00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:02,230
go check it out register and participate

00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:04,930
participate with what's interesting to

00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:08,110
you you know there are a lot of other

00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:09,610
there a lot of news and things happening

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,440
on the web it's hard to break through

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,510
that with with with all the chatter

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,730
that's out there but we're also looking

00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:16,900
for contributions if you know of a story

00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:18,880
that's out there that we should

00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,530
highlight we would love to know about it

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,260
if you know of a person that's out there

00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,910
blogging already about similar topics

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:27,280
we'd love for you to we'd love for you

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:30,160
to help us make that connection and then

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,770
we're at or open-source away on all the

00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:36,940
different social media things here are

00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:38,590
identical all that great stuff I'll

00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,800
actually mention this at mentioned

00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:44,020
earlier we use YouTube to host all our

00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,610
videos we don't have a lot of video

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,500
content we're actually that's one thing

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:48,700
we haven't figured out yet most of our

00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:52,420
video is kind of the talking

00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:55,000
head thing which is not really exciting

00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:57,910
to a lot of people so we are trying to

00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,680
figure out if we can do more things like

00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:02,290
how to's like i described with the music

00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:04,240
webcast like I think that's when you can

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:06,190
explain something and give it make it

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,640
useful I think people are going to use

00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:12,640
it linkedin we may basically just create

00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,950
a linkedin group to have one but the

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,180
working theory is that we we're trying

00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:18,600
to figure out how we can allow people to

00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:22,420
post jobs related to open source there

00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:24,370
without trying to define what open

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,100
sources from a legal perspective is

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,170
that's a big can of worms so we're

00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:30,970
trying to figure that piece out you know

00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:33,940
there's ways that you can have

00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:36,070
discussions and LinkedIn but frankly we

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:37,930
want most of the discussion happening on

00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,550
the site so we're we're towing with this

00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:41,290
you know it's this balance of user

00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:43,840
engagement and where that happens and

00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:45,610
you've kind of got to be willing to make

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,760
the sacrifice to now with you know with

00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:50,380
Facebook doing the new polls do polls on

00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,760
the website make sense or do we do polls

00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,140
on Facebook is that a different way to

00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,330
engage our audience or do we do them in

00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:56,740
both places we're going to try it out

00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:58,390
and see what happens or maybe you do

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,330
different versions of the pole we're not

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,860
sure yet we've got to figure it out

00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,630
that's all i have i always leave time

00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:07,570
because i tend to have a fair amount of

00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:10,570
questions but these is how you get to

00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:15,490
hold me and i open the floor to

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:21,000
questions if you have them I usually

00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:21,000
have questions yeah

00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:35,230
yeah these are all third-party tools so

00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:39,940
the community mailing list that we have

00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:45,010
are all mailman and the the monthly

00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:47,680
newsletter I believe it's illiquid yeah

00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,170
the question was what kind of tools do

00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:53,740
we use to manage our mailing list and

00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:57,840
and so the community mail mr. mailman

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:57,840
and the marketing one is eloquent

00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:21,320
yeah so the question is how we

00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,350
considered doing a volunteer editor or

00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:27,790
even a paid editor so at this point

00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:30,200
we're we're not paying for content so

00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,090
it's hard like I said it is kind of a

00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,000
volunteer effort at this point the way

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:37,310
that we have it set up now is that we

00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,680
have a moderator for each community

00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:41,060
that's already employee and so we were

00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:43,010
very transparent with that when we

00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,240
launched and said this is this is how

00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:46,190
we're going to approach it now this

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,020
could change in the future but each

00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:51,260
channel has a moderator it's a rather

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:54,080
employee and then their job is to find

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,760
content curate authors and manage their

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:59,960
little kind of sub community on the site

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,570
but we we're not really willing to pay

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:14,290
for content at this point it could get

00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:14,290
pricey right anything else yes

00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:29,420
so the question is have we considered

00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:47,360
doing a pyramid scheme of sharing

00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:48,890
content with your friends right so um so

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,290
the question is from a marketing

00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:53,480
standpoint how we tried to force

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:54,680
anything viral and I guess that you know

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,850
the answer is it's hard to force the

00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,790
viral thing like those things just kind

00:32:55,850 --> 00:33:01,370
of happen on their own but what we will

00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:03,410
we have considered and probably kind of

00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:05,680
in the works is creating like site

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,430
advocates so who are the people that are

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:09,140
we're actually starting to look at the

00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:10,670
data from the points that we have now so

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:13,070
we've got about six month worth of

00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:15,200
points accumulation we're starting to

00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:17,630
look at who is commenting the most on

00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,150
the site who's voting rating articles

00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,010
the most on the site and we have those

00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,280
advocates already we just need to figure

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:27,290
out we need to direct their energy and

00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:28,850
so we have the data we're just we're

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:31,370
trying to marriage that data with the

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,950
user and what we can do to empower them

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:36,650
to basically do what they're already

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,780
doing but at a larger scale and I think

00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:41,120
you know that's kind of brings back the

00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:43,340
can contributor spotlight maybe that's a

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,920
way that we can do it this highlight the

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:47,780
person hey this person you know did 10

00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:49,160
comments on the site last week they've

00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:50,600
got something to say you should go read

00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,970
their comments and you know things like

00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,950
that so we've thought about in a way but

00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:57,950
not not a forced viral marketing

00:33:54,950 --> 00:34:00,250
campaign so to speak yeah another

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:00,250
question

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:11,890
sure so the question was around points

00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:17,230
and badges do we do anything similar

00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:20,170
before square yeah so right now there's

00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:23,260
no there's no reward for it they'll

00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:25,570
basically move up the scale from newbie

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,280
to community member to open enthusiasts

00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,600
to rock star and there may be another

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:33,490
category in the future because we've got

00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,690
well one thing that we that we need to

00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:36,670
do that it's on our to-do list is

00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:38,230
actually to make a page that shows the

00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:40,990
the folks that are making some of those

00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:46,930
achievements we just haven't gotten to

00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:50,230
that one yet and we also do we do have a

00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:52,780
few special badges that we've made if

00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:54,550
for folks that were registered with the

00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,980
site before our anniversary we gave them

00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:59,260
a special founding members badge and so

00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,640
that was we used trigger to help us with

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,670
that and basically said if you have a

00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,470
badge before this date and this time

00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:07,240
give them this badge we also have things

00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:10,270
like badges for our admins just to

00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,580
identify an admin on the site we have a

00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:16,080
special badge for authors so if they

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:18,340
write a node that's content type article

00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:19,990
that gets published then they get the

00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,310
author badge and so we're kind of we're

00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:24,400
considering we don't want to go badge

00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,140
crazy we want to make it relevant so we

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,760
do kind of we're always creative and

00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:31,500
thinking of what other badges might work

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,500
well with our audience so we have a few

00:35:39,570 --> 00:36:06,160
right sure ok so the comment was

00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:08,590
basically is there is there a way to to

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,730
use badges that would actually help the

00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,370
user promote something that they're

00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:13,600
passionate about so I would say the

00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:15,040
answer is probably yes we probably

00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,830
haven't thought of the best way to do

00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:20,470
that yet or actually thought about that

00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,570
so but we now we have thought of we've

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:26,170
considered a version of that of can

00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:30,130
users put badges going to be the wrong

00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,510
word but can users put a promotion for

00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,000
open source like home on their site and

00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:36,580
it would be maybe like the comment that

00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,110
they just did or you know something to

00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,490
that if like something that they wanted

00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:41,170
to highlight as opposed to something

00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:43,600
that we say here here's this widget go

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,420
put it on your site but you know for the

00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,640
authors it would be we might create a I

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:50,260
just called a widget that says I write

00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,520
for open source com and then they could

00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,530
put that on their site and it could link

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,360
to their profile page where it lists all

00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:56,620
the content that they've contributed so

00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:58,090
that might be we've talked about that we

00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,470
just haven't we haven't done it yet we

00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,470
haven't figure out the best way to do it

00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:05,400
more questions yeah

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:26,650
yeah sure so the question is around how

00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,089
do we use and deploy mullum on the site

00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:34,970
we use the CAPTCHA so for registration

00:37:31,089 --> 00:37:37,279
we have the horrible captcha thing that

00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:40,940
you can never read we also have it on

00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:42,140
comments and I believe if I understand

00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:44,420
how Mollom works correctly it has a

00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:46,970
reputation system on the back end I've

00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:49,779
actually been working with Greece and

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:52,160
some folks on the Mollom team to get

00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:53,240
Mollom working against registration

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,210
because that's where we're seeing a huge

00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,279
problem is with the black hat SEO

00:37:55,210 --> 00:38:01,009
currently is the way I understand it

00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:02,839
mollem works really well for comments so

00:38:01,009 --> 00:38:05,539
we can pick it does a scan on the plain

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,569
text just scan for a number of links and

00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:10,430
some kind of hot keywords and that will

00:38:08,569 --> 00:38:12,109
trigger Mollom I hit you're good I get

00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,749
triggered on jido all the time for

00:38:12,109 --> 00:38:16,609
whatever i right and I mean I'm an

00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:20,269
organizer on my group and so I cannot

00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:21,769
figure that peace out however for us you

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:23,210
know we have we have the CAPTCHA and it

00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:25,430
goes against comments it works fairly

00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,839
well there but one of the things that

00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:29,529
we'd like to see with mala must actually

00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:32,599
work against user registration so

00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:34,839
conceptually building a database of user

00:38:32,599 --> 00:38:36,769
registrants that are marked as spam and

00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:39,440
sharing that with other folks who use

00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:42,589
Mollom I think it's a great idea I don't

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,119
know the best way to implement it but it

00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:46,160
seems like the structures there but if

00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,319
we're already doing the comments piece

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,960
of that giving that feedback we go on

00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:52,400
all the time we probably have about five

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,710
to ten comment today that we have to go

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,859
in and look at manually that make it

00:38:54,710 --> 00:39:00,349
through the system and so we just go in

00:38:57,859 --> 00:39:02,509
and say report to Mollom as spam submit

00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:05,119
and we've got enough folks helping us

00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:08,210
out there that it works up fairly well

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:10,489
so it's not a too tedious but I'd like

00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:12,559
to see that same principle put against

00:39:10,489 --> 00:39:16,400
user registrations currently we're just

00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:18,580
blocking them if you if you have to deal

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,140
with a lot of spam on your site I

00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,840
doing it wrong the first time I was

00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,220
going in and deleting the user accounts

00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,780
and I found out the best practice was to

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,910
block them so that they can't come back

00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:31,480
and register with the same email and

00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:33,160
same username so I'd like to see those

00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,930
blocked accounts be registered with

00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:36,880
Mollom so that we can actually share

00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,550
because I'm sure that the spammers are

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,190
hitting multiple sites of you know the

00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:44,860
same time and or multiple times so how

00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:47,850
can we together fight spam with Mollom

00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,850
with user registration

00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,250
yeah so the comment was with any large

00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:14,180
site you're gonna see similar things and

00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:18,260
we actually do we get a few complaints

00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:20,120
about the CAPTCHA I've gotten a couple I

00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:23,270
guess people are still using IE six

00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:25,160
can't figure that one out but apparently

00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:27,800
it doesn't work sometimes with ie6 and

00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,000
they don't see the CAPTCHA and so

00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,490
they're like what do I it's not going

00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,080
through and I always ask about what

00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:37,100
browser you're using and the culprit is

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:38,660
typically ie6 so I mean very few I think

00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:43,100
most of our audience is hopefully using

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:55,730
Firefox or Safari so where we don't see

00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:58,240
too many of those yeah so the question

00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,220
was what kind of analytics do we use

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,860
unfortunately i don't know of great open

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,570
source tool to recommend and some of my

00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:07,850
personal sites i use webalizer and

00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:12,020
things that come with the typical cpanel

00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:15,320
type stuff we use a product called

00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:17,690
omniture mostly because Red Hat was

00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:20,630
using it so we're going to tailgate with

00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,610
that I'm just great I mean it collects

00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:25,340
all the data that we would ever need and

00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:27,650
we don't have time to analyze it a lot

00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:29,180
of it so it's mostly if we have a very

00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:32,530
strategic than that we're looking into

00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:34,760
will go in and we have a daily report

00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:38,660
weekly report a monthly report that's

00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,860
focus on our content but we're also

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,900
trying to for it what else do we need to

00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,820
be monitoring that omniture can can give

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,130
us so we can go in and like i'll

00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:48,620
typically run ad hoc reports that will

00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:53,000
show me where our traffic is coming from

00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:54,800
because that's always interesting last

00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,880
time I looked like we get about five to

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,340
seven percent of our traffic from

00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,010
Twitter which I I mean it shows you kind

00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:03,830
of how well we you know we built up that

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,960
outlet for us I didn't mention earlier

00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,640
but so the social media pieces for us

00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,160
are basically our distribution system

00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:11,660
for content you know that paired with

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,430
the email I mean unless somebody's

00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,690
coming to the site every day I mean this

00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:17,570
is a way to kind of say here's our new

00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,670
article or our strategy on

00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:20,990
on Twitter or what we call it we just

00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:22,580
call it Twitter and we internally

00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:25,580
understand it means put it on facebook

00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:27,410
twitter and identica what we do when we

00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:29,660
have a new article that's that's

00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:32,360
published how we use a tool called

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:35,450
HootSuite to manage some of our tomatoes

00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:36,800
our social media actually will have it

00:42:35,450 --> 00:42:42,800
up so I can maybe give you a little

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:45,440
sneak preview I usually don't do this so

00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,660
this is a screenshot of HootSuite it

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,490
works kind of like other like TweetDeck

00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:52,070
and other other things it gives you

00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:53,690
different streams so this is my this is

00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:56,650
my personal stream so i have my twitter

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,820
home feed where i get mentioned and then

00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:02,540
when i go to conferences i usually

00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:04,850
create i look for the hashtag or the

00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,470
conference the conference buzzword and

00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,330
so at this is how I've been keeping

00:43:06,470 --> 00:43:10,490
track right here of what's been

00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:13,460
happening at the southeast linux fest so

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:16,400
i look for the the self 2011 hashtag and

00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,810
the selinux fest name and i can see the

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,240
conversation that's happening at the

00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:24,020
conference but i'll switch over enough

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:26,300
about me switch over we have on our open

00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:28,850
source way when we have a new article

00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:30,530
come out we send it we use ping FM to

00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:33,650
send it to Twitter and identica at the

00:43:30,530 --> 00:43:35,720
same time we were doing that with

00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:39,620
facebook as well but what we figured out

00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:42,110
is to send it to actually send it to

00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:43,910
those media outlets at separate times so

00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,700
usually we'll get it out on Twitter

00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:50,780
first and then Facebook will be about an

00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:52,160
hour or two hours behind we were and

00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:53,810
we're also conscious of time zone so you

00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,880
I play the time zone game if we have

00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:58,250
content that might be relevant to the

00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:59,720
west coast we try to get it at a time

00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,160
appropriate for the west coast when

00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,630
somebody might pick it up if we have

00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:05,300
content that might be relevant to Asia

00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:07,910
Pacific area we might tweet it at nine

00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:09,770
or ten o'clock at night the biggest

00:44:07,910 --> 00:44:12,500
advantage of the highlight for HootSuite

00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:13,940
is or two we have multiple users in here

00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:15,170
so it's not just me and here managing

00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:18,200
all the stuff we actually have a team of

00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:21,740
people that can go in and look if I

00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:23,630
scroll over this way we have a list of

00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:25,520
our sent tweets and then are pending to

00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:28,580
eat so we actually set tough we tweet in

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,140
the future this is great because we can

00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:31,010
as I mentioned when we have a new

00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,960
article come out

00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:36,230
we get it out on the wire fairly quickly

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,880
so we if we have content that's ready we

00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:39,980
usually auto publish it at about six or

00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,170
seven in the morning and then we'll get

00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:45,860
it on the wire like nine o'clock in the

00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:47,780
morning East time east eastern time then

00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:49,580
we'll we'll go through the content and

00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,980
we'll pull out sound sound bites and

00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,810
we'll set up about two to four

00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,910
additional tweets for that content over

00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:59,120
a to the three-week period at random

00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:01,070
times like two in the afternoon seven at

00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:03,020
night those type of things because we

00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:04,540
want is we want people to read the

00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:06,440
content so we kind of stretch it out if

00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:08,510
particularly on Twitter if you're like

00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,580
me I'm not going that far back in time

00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:13,090
to see what happened on Twitter I might

00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:15,230
go back an hour to if you're lucky

00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:16,850
unless I'm looking at some of my streams

00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:18,020
like I went back and saw that some of

00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,490
the conversation that has happened last

00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:21,350
night for the conference so I went back

00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,370
a little bit in time there but for

00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,830
typically I'm not going to go to

00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:27,560
somebody's Twitter and look at what

00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:30,050
happened the last two days so that's a

00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,480
little secret sauce that we use from a

00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:35,960
Content perspective we also will look

00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,970
through the comments if there's a lot of

00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,160
comments on the article will pull out

00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:42,830
user comments and we'll tweet those out

00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,090
will do going to quote you know this is

00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:45,290
a great you know it's not this is a

00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:47,060
great Ark will pull out a good little

00:45:45,290 --> 00:45:48,140
soundbite and if and then actually do

00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:50,000
some due diligence see if i can find

00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,560
that person on Twitter so we can give

00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,660
them a little bit of recognition you

00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,680
know with their twitter handle and tweet

00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,310
that out like here's part of the

00:45:54,680 --> 00:46:00,260
conversation joe said you know I can't

00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:03,920
believe this isn't open and then a link

00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,090
to the article so little social media

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,080
tips you actually do a little social

00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:11,150
media section what else do we do and

00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,500
then like I said we haven't figured the

00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:14,270
Facebook part out so we usually just

00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:16,730
published the article to Facebook once

00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:18,050
we don't want to have the you know you

00:46:16,730 --> 00:46:24,770
don't see the same article like four

00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:27,130
times on that facebook page go it keep

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:27,130
asking

00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:53,510
yeah so the question is around or is it

00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:55,220
is there a way to use things like

00:46:53,510 --> 00:46:57,079
trigger trooper modules to do this for

00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:58,599
us I don't know that much about trigger

00:46:57,079 --> 00:47:03,859
so I'm gonna have to go look into that

00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:05,619
we do we have I might be able to let me

00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:11,029
see if I can pull this up really quick

00:47:05,619 --> 00:47:12,319
we have twitter integrated into I don't

00:47:11,029 --> 00:47:13,970
know the right terminology the stack

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,670
menu at the bottom that you showed

00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:19,010
earlier so me I'll just go in here and

00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:21,190
i'll do a show you the screen that we

00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,190
have

00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:31,290
so you what will happen when we publish

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,170
as well come down here and we'll

00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:36,530
highlight this post to Twitter and then

00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,910
we click that and it audit so this is

00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:41,310
integrated with our open source feeds

00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:44,300
account and it's also integrated with

00:47:41,310 --> 00:47:46,470
our bit ly account that we have set up

00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:49,140
bit ly if you're not familiar with it as

00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:50,340
a URL shortening service that actually

00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,630
has some really good stats they've

00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:56,700
improved their stats over the last few

00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:59,520
weeks we also add an Omniture tracking

00:47:56,700 --> 00:48:02,790
code to that URL before I get shortened

00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,850
so that we can track how effective our

00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:07,590
social media use is if we if I were to

00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:09,570
hit submit now this would actually send

00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:15,930
out a tweet to our open source feeds

00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:24,030
account and it would include the title

00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:26,880
and the short URL and so this open

00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:30,540
source feeds is basically as I described

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:33,180
earlier an RSS feed of our content so we

00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,890
did that on Friday morning so we hit the

00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,310
twitter button hit submit and it shows

00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,310
up there

00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:47,400
we do yeah so the question was do we use

00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:49,260
scheduler I don't know if we use I don't

00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:53,070
know the name of the particular module I

00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:57,380
go in here and i use article workflow

00:48:53,070 --> 00:49:00,810
and we are able to change the state from

00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:02,190
review to published and then set a time

00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:03,420
in the future like i said we usually set

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:04,770
it for six in the morning so at the end

00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:07,650
of my day I'm going and seeing what

00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,630
content is ready and then we probably

00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:12,030
schedule about half our content and then

00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:14,100
the other part of it is hey this one's

00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,110
ready go publish it we've got it ready

00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,540
let's go do it so we publish it when

00:49:16,110 --> 00:49:20,670
it's ready but we we found that we're

00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:22,200
more successful and when we have things

00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:24,660
that are that are Auto published because

00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,220
the user i think is expecting some sort

00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,300
of consistency on that end of hey

00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:28,650
there's going to be a new article every

00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:31,680
day at eight o'clock in the morning or

00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:33,450
something to that effect so we try to

00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,930
have at least one new article ready in

00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:38,340
the morning and then for us we don't we

00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:40,260
don't like to do like three at a time I

00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,880
guess we kind of where our approaches we

00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,100
do a kind of one morning one mid morning

00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:46,350
and then one afternoon because we're

00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:50,340
having about two to four our new

00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:53,010
articles a day on the site another thing

00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:56,670
I'll mention we one of our strategies

00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:58,470
because getting content is so hard we're

00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:03,330
getting like kind of full original

00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:05,370
content is hard we we actually will will

00:50:03,330 --> 00:50:07,530
aggregate other content that we find

00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:11,370
that's relevant to our site but we also

00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:13,890
do this we use the same article i don't

00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:15,930
know if i have one readily available we

00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:18,450
call them open threads so it's the same

00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:20,490
content type as an article it's just

00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:23,010
more of like a question it's like what

00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:24,870
would you open source today or you might

00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:27,030
have seen it on our little table that we

00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:28,170
had at the event you know what what's

00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,610
something that you would like to see

00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:31,020
more open and so we're just kind of

00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,570
throw out this question to see if we can

00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,610
generate a thread of conversation around

00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:36,960
it so it's kind of something quick for

00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:40,650
us to kind of get out there it might be

00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,690
newsworthy you know but we're kind of

00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:44,070
leaning more towards doing polls so we

00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,900
actually give people some options to

00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:48,920
make a little bit easier but all of our

00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:52,740
polls if I you know drill through on

00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,040
this one so we this one was a this one

00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:55,320
about

00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,050
skype open source alternative skype was

00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,900
a reaction to the news when Microsoft

00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:05,460
purchased skype and we actually had one

00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:08,550
previous to this related to you know

00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:11,970
would Microsoft open-source skype and we

00:51:08,550 --> 00:51:14,430
had a interesting comments that occur on

00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:17,700
that but um I just clicked on something

00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:20,550
bad yeah so here's a bunch of comments

00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:22,800
on that thread but anyway we do allow

00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:24,570
people to comment on the threads to or

00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,700
excuse me we do allow people to comment

00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,840
on the polls so if there we always got

00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:31,350
though you should have done this option

00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:32,670
we always get those so it's fun I think

00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:36,420
I've got time for maybe one more

00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:37,980
question and i'll be hanging out

00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:39,990
afterwards to if you don't want to ask

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,880
in front of the camera well great well

00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:43,890
thanks everyone for attending today if

00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:47,690
you have any feedback or any other

00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:47,690
questions just let me know thanks

00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:12,380
what about this I can help the like it

00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:16,779
we have the same problem or whatever to

00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:16,779
do you think the identity

00:52:17,590 --> 00:52:20,700
let's let the word out

00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:25,890
you

00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:37,990
well s an OS that works the way that you

00:52:33,970 --> 00:52:43,180
do across all your devices HP Slate and

00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:46,060
webos HP as a service leader in cloud

00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,830
computing all we do is hosting computing

00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:49,870
to us the cloud is just the next

00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:51,310
generation of hosting and if someone

00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:52,930
who's been in the hosting industry for

00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:55,030
12 years we feel we're in a unique

00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:56,680
position to really help bring these two

00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:58,690
worlds together these different sets of

00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,850
technologies and to help companies

00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:03,730
embrace this new world in this great new

00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:05,650
tool that allows faster innovation not

00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:07,630
only is it about us being responsive and

00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:09,990
accountable but it's about us doing more

00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:09,990
