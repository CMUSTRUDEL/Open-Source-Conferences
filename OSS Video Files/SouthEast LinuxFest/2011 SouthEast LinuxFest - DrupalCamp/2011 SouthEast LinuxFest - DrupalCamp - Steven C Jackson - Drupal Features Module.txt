00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:39,210
ok my talk today is on the Drupal's

00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,010
features module if you were here last

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:46,969
hour you have seen my presentation due

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:52,320
to scheduling this is where I ended up

00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:54,030
but anyway about me which is going to be

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,940
completely new from the previous

00:00:54,030 --> 00:01:00,030
presentation my name is Steven Jackson

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:02,910
I'm co-owner iOS solutions with mr.

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:06,210
Roger super over here I'm a back-end

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:10,950
developer i work with PHP with mysql

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:13,170
databases do a bunch of you know linux

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,070
configuration and lots of C Objective C

00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,220
C++ Java etc I've been working with

00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:22,110
Drupal for about three years now my

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,659
partner started with four but I started

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:31,220
with five but to go on you know what is

00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:34,579
features basically features is a

00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:38,850
contributory / project / features and

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:43,860
download the module itself and what it

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,170
does is it logically bundles any

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,680
components on your drupal system that

00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,780
you would like and you can attach attack

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,390
the problem and you know kind of

00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,640
whatever way you want whether like

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,110
connerton had mentioned you know a photo

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,180
gallery if you want to bundle it up

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:03,450
photo gallery or if you want to take

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,939
another direction and bundle up just you

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:10,800
know kind of permissions or kind of

00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,989
admin and kind of deal why features

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,750
basically drupal loves the database

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:16,450
there's not

00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,130
a whole lot of code on the system pretty

00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:20,560
much everything gets read out of the

00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:23,620
node table the users table and well

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,050
every table however this is a nightmare

00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:29,380
if there's more than one person on the

00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,480
project basically because you know

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,270
versioning a database is pretty

00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,850
impossible maybe if you contact oracle

00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:42,040
they can hook you up but if you got that

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:43,600
kind of cash then that's cool but so so

00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,959
basically what what you're going to do

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,270
is take you know this database and kind

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,560
of put it into code so you can version

00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,690
control what's in the database and then

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,360
what's really great about it is it's

00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,920
then distributable anybody that has a

00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,540
Drupal website can then take your

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,550
feature and install it and now have your

00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:07,900
own functionality in there that has all

00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,610
your different views content types

00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,760
permissions strong-arm variables etc

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,260
basically I decided that slides suck

00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,610
they they're boring you're going to fall

00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:26,739
asleep so I'm just going to show you

00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:31,120
what it is and hopefully okay screens

00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:34,470
are mirrored for some reason I see the

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,470
library from his telephone

00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:50,260
there's my status okay this really

00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:52,210
screwed with my resolution there all

00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:57,160
right so this is a site that i just

00:03:52,210 --> 00:04:00,490
installed from a install profile this is

00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:02,950
one of Sony's deals so if you go that a

00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:08,140
sony BMG artist site this is the core of

00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:10,740
their code but don't tell them that so

00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:15,610
here we see we have some latest activity

00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:19,180
some other information we click around

00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:22,210
we have the admin module here if we go

00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:25,090
to administer and then build and we can

00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:34,300
see we've got a ton of views on the site

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:40,060
of course my local is just as slow as

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:44,230
mr. konert sins so well that's going i'm

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:46,260
going to open another tab the admin

00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,260
section

00:04:53,900 --> 00:05:03,330
just nice and slow you can see they have

00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:04,919
a few issues not related to this so we

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:07,800
have all kinds of views here the

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:13,260
features page is loading I do have my

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:22,169
NetBeans fired up however good that did

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:23,490
load Edmond build features to get it

00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:27,080
you're just going to dress download

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:31,320
Russian able or the traditional route of

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,000
NW get or downloaded extract install we

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,830
already have a couple features on this

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:42,780
system but we're going to create another

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:46,080
feature and you just do that by clicking

00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:47,850
create feature hopefully now that most

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,750
of the site has been cached we're not

00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:52,890
going to run into the slowness issue

00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,180
basically you want to put in a name and

00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:57,300
a description everything else is

00:05:54,180 --> 00:06:01,350
optional in version number a URL of

00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:09,120
update but for name we're just going to

00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:15,150
call this a test feature this is a test

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:18,300
of the feature system and then we have

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:21,090
all these components so basically you

00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,770
see cck through views here these are all

00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,800
the different items that you can include

00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:28,110
yeah you can't include taxonomy some

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,570
block stuff you can include blocks

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:35,370
settings but not really individual

00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:37,950
blocks themselves not taxonomy like like

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:40,470
mr. Connors in there I myself like to

00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:44,070
start with content types as well as cck

00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:47,250
is all the different cck elements that

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,919
you have on your site so when you see

00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:52,260
stuff there you'll see video landing

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:56,160
page etc those are individual fields

00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:58,590
within the content but if you go to the

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,780
content type then you can click on any

00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,680
one of those and we'll choose news

00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,620
article

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,509
and then it will then you know take all

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,240
the strong arm variables it'll take any

00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:14,820
of the dependencies and any fields that

00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:17,250
news article requires additionally we

00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,440
can you know choose multiple components

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,110
etc and it's just going to keep building

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,870
this list on the side and what I really

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,080
want to show you guys is the code and

00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:29,910
everything behind the scenes so we've

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,000
got our content type there's a couple

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:35,070
views associated with some of this stuff

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:40,349
all the views for this site have been

00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:42,389
included in other features you can also

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:43,800
choose different roles and that's one of

00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:47,070
the cool thing about working with

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,460
features is that as you add items to

00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,500
your feature the those items from the

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,900
list within the drop-down get deprecated

00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,389
so then you don't have you don't end up

00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:03,120
you know reusing the same components

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:05,070
over and over you can basically get your

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,530
entire site bundled up without a whole

00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,659
bunch of unnecessary redundancy and a

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:13,680
lot of cases redundancies good but in

00:08:09,659 --> 00:08:15,840
the features they handle it nicely when

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,720
you download the feature it's going to

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,310
if you have one already named that or

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,039
there's a module on the site it's going

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:27,180
to let you know that there's nothing

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:30,810
good coming up that you save the file it

00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:34,279
puts it in a tar hopefully I don't have

00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,279
anything disgusting on this computer

00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:41,900
extract here screw it

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,670
so you see we get all these files

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,470
created we get our dot info and dot

00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:05,380
module which are if you went to the

00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:07,660
module creation talk earlier you're

00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,340
going to see that those are the two core

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,250
files that are required for when you

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:14,170
create a module the dot module all it

00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,020
has is and include in it and we're going

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:19,720
to look at that once I open up NetBeans

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,480
over here in order to get the feature

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,690
installed on your site all you have to

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:30,310
do is take that directory that was

00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:34,800
created and throwing a dash or here make

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,800
sure it doesn't spit angry fire at me

00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:51,670
clients sites all modules now this

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:53,650
modules directory here the way that I

00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:56,320
like to keep my site all modules

00:09:53,650 --> 00:10:00,310
directory is with a customer can't rib

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,930
and it features a section in here that

00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,850
way you know you know what came from

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:05,800
drupal.org what you wrote yourself and

00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:07,120
what you bundled up as a feature so I'm

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:14,940
just going to throw this in features

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,940
here and now if we go there

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,790
we go in here we see test features in

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:38,160
there and now when we go to the site

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:41,910
itself now that we've created the future

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,920
we can go to admin build modules and we

00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,450
will see our features module in there

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,450
and all you have to do is enable it

00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,110
there it is so it says feature all we

00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:12,720
have to do is select it enable it it's

00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:24,529
then going to show up in our features

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:24,529
list extremely slow

00:11:42,019 --> 00:11:46,809
so I've enabled that feature we see test

00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:50,269
feature there it's in the default state

00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:53,480
that's because no views or blocks or

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:55,550
anything have been overridden nor has

00:11:53,480 --> 00:12:00,860
any of the code been updated by your

00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:02,809
favorite text editor etc one great thing

00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,970
I think about features is once you've

00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:07,369
created your feature if you're updating

00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:09,379
the existing components within that

00:12:07,369 --> 00:12:11,329
feature you don't have to go through

00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:16,189
that download process and move the files

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:17,929
/ etc anymore if you update the view it

00:12:16,189 --> 00:12:19,879
recognizes that you already have that

00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:22,279
view in your feature and it just

00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:27,110
overwrites the code however if you add

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:28,459
an additional view or additional content

00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,319
type etc you're going to have to go back

00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,339
through that download process you

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:38,749
recreate the feature basically copy it

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:44,660
move it over and uh and then revert the

00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:47,779
feature so I mean that that's basically

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,939
the basis of features but my fit I'm I'm

00:12:47,779 --> 00:12:55,249
a coder so i'm going to show you the

00:12:49,939 --> 00:13:00,019
coding end of stuff so here i have this

00:12:55,249 --> 00:13:06,949
feature here so we see the dot info this

00:13:00,019 --> 00:13:08,839
is for georgetown site we see all these

00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:11,029
dependencies that depends on everything

00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:12,559
from you know content see tools of

00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,949
course it depends on features you have

00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,899
to have features to use features

00:13:14,949 --> 00:13:20,540
taxonomy views etc you can choose

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,579
whatever dependencies you want you can

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,319
edit this file add your own dependencies

00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,839
if for some reason it didn't show up in

00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:29,480
the list like say some other feature

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,549
already required this module or

00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:35,470
something else and it's no longer in the

00:13:31,549 --> 00:13:37,610
list you can manually add it here and

00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,449
then of course you can update the

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:43,610
description and then this this little

00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:46,579
section with the features and then the

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,829
square bracket it basically is letting

00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:51,259
you know what each little piece and all

00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:54,860
these little all these files included in

00:13:51,259 --> 00:13:55,760
like gtown homepage here what items it's

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,940
going to call

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:03,290
so basically this is kind of setting up

00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:05,960
the file name function name kind of

00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:08,840
stuff when we actually when we go into

00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:11,270
the dot module typically all you would

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,150
see is three lines you would see this

00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:16,370
PHP a blank line and include once and

00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,380
that include wants is including the dot

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,930
feature stink file that features

00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:24,230
generates and that really is going to

00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:28,490
have the bulk of your code included in

00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:33,140
it and so so this is where it's pulling

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:36,680
in the ctools plugin information some

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,630
different image cache items the the

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,660
views if you've written custom modules

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:43,010
before or if you've exported a view via

00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,470
the interface it's going to look

00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:47,300
extremely familiar because basically

00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,090
what it's doing is it's setting up the

00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:52,960
views array and if you wanted to update

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:57,320
this feature yourself or create a module

00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:59,090
and I think using features as an idea of

00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,880
understanding module development is

00:14:59,090 --> 00:15:03,080
great because if you choose a view and

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,820
export it and it puts it in the code

00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,700
this is exactly how you would write a

00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,950
view in code to then get it to show up

00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,690
on your system so you can go through

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,660
here it's setting up the views array and

00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:19,150
then setting up all the different items

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:23,150
within the view object or array and and

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:25,790
sending that all back and again the

00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:28,850
feature that you just created is a

00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:31,250
normal module like you would create

00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:34,010
yourself or get from drupal.org some

00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:36,170
contribs source whatever so you can add

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:38,330
your custom code and I normally always

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,900
add you know this custom code section

00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:45,470
here so I added my own hook block into

00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:51,290
this set of code to do a couple things

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:55,220
in some of them and do i did a hook

00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:58,280
filter block there and different links

00:15:55,220 --> 00:16:00,440
etc you can add as much to this dot

00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,810
module file as you would like this is

00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:05,060
something that features if you add this

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:07,310
to the dot module file features isn't

00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:08,840
going to show it as an overridden state

00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:11,120
because

00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:13,160
dot module is only going to have those

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,650
three lines so it's like okay these

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,750
three lines are there anything up extra

00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:20,480
is gravy but it's not affecting the core

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:24,920
of the feature that you just created so

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:29,000
have at it in the dot module and that's

00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:31,970
where you put all your code super great

00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,770
about features is like I said if you're

00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:35,840
working by yourself you're not going to

00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:38,480
care too much about the database

00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,160
changing a lot but you have multiple

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,080
people on a project and that's typically

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,950
what's going to happen on you know some

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:48,740
enterprise level Drupal site and so you

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:51,610
you've got your your code here and I'm

00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:58,400
going to go back a couple of directories

00:16:51,610 --> 00:17:01,070
to the site route so if I want to show

00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,040
my get branches so currently I'm working

00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,990
off the master branch but I want to work

00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:10,100
on this feature but I don't want to

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:13,580
affect anybody else so what I might do

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:17,330
is I might do something like get check

00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:20,810
out dash B for branch give it some kind

00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:24,280
of name like dev dash test underscore

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:26,630
feature check it out from origin master

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:30,560
and that's just convention that I use

00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:33,020
because I use github and then what you

00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:34,910
can do is bam you've switched to the

00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,260
you've created a new branch you've

00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,840
switched to it you can work on your

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:40,520
feature so you basically kind of

00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,410
branched off of the project while

00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:45,170
everybody else is working on their own

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,600
system working on the different code you

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,490
can work on rolling out your feature and

00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,800
what's very useful about branching while

00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:53,630
using features is that when you branch

00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,300
off and use your feature like I said

00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:57,380
before when you select items from the

00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,180
list that you want to include in your

00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,890
feature of those items get deprecated

00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,840
from that list somebody else is working

00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:05,090
on another feature but they're like aha

00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,300
I also want to include this content type

00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,830
in this feature because while you know

00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,970
we're bundling up all the features for

00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,560
this site well I want to use this

00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,990
feature on this other site and if it

00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,450
doesn't have that content type included

00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,300
then you have to manually create it etc

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:23,900
so by getting this information in code

00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:26,150
you can branch off merge back in and

00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,910
you're not going to have any real

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:33,170
conflicts or anything if features

00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:34,850
include the the same items of course you

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,520
will have problems if they include same

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:39,080
function names say anything that you put

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:44,600
in that dot module you want to make sure

00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:47,090
is unique and then when you get done you

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:49,670
can merge that branch back in and what

00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:51,560
this does is it really really helps with

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:54,590
scalability and performance of your site

00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:58,250
it helps keep a sanity check on your

00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:01,640
developers and the people maintaining

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,170
the project and just having an encode

00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,560
being able to read and see what it's

00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:09,620
doing making minor tweaks as you need to

00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:12,500
views rights horrendous code so if you

00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:14,690
export the stuff to a feature you can go

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,250
in and tweak it I don't know if

00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,020
anybody's taking a really good look at

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:21,860
the sequel queries and stuff that views

00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:23,660
generates awful it's a great tool but if

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:27,380
you want it to scale you're going to

00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:30,230
want to kind of tweak those items so you

00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,050
can get this into code and push it up

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,910
the branch and if the database should

00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:37,100
crash or whatever and you hadn't made

00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,020
proper backups while you might not

00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:40,910
maintain the content unless you did some

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,940
kind of node export or whatever you will

00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:53,810
have the basis of a working site going

00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:58,550
forward so you know you once that's

00:19:53,810 --> 00:20:01,510
going you see default overridden here if

00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,800
you click on overridden it's going to

00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,270
tell you you know what item is

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,460
overridden so there are some block

00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:13,130
settings in here that are different in

00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:15,650
the database then are in the code and so

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,810
when you go through here you can see

00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:20,300
what's going on and decide whether or

00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:23,930
not okay the stuffing code is newer so I

00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,550
want to revert my site or the stuff on

00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:29,180
the site is newer and I want to update

00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,950
the code and you can do that either you

00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,200
know through this interface here which i

00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,860
think is cumbersome I I come like said

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,260
coding back

00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:38,720
around I hate using a graphical

00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:40,340
interface and clicking around it drives

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,510
me up the wall when all i have to do is

00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:47,630
type a couple commands and what i would

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,059
do here is just drush a few and then

00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:52,670
it's for feature update and then

00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:57,380
whatever future name or you can do drush

00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:59,990
a few all etc that's for updating so

00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:01,730
what what that's doing is taking what's

00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:06,950
in the database and updating your code

00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:09,710
if you do a future of vert or FR for

00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:11,990
short that's taking what is in the code

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:16,280
and then pushing the changes up to your

00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:19,730
database this makes you know if you use

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:22,730
git or have multiple developers or

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,740
whatever all this item encode it has

00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:26,960
accountability for who made the change

00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,040
whereas if you went into the database

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,070
you're not going to know who made the

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,990
change if somebody like Roger gave and

00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:35,230
his talk earlier if you have a lot of

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,780
people logging in as admin on the site

00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:40,220
because you haven't properly given the

00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:43,309
right permissions to each specific

00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:45,350
person again you kind of lose that

00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,330
information and the database however in

00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:50,840
code you get all the different

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:52,370
timestamps you get the you know the tags

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,220
and everything that you can associate

00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:57,440
with your version controlling and I'm

00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:59,150
big proponent of version control and

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,370
perhaps I should have talked about get

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:05,720
with Drupal instead of a second features

00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:08,360
talk however once you get that you get

00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:11,090
it merged back into main get it pulled

00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:13,640
into your database and less than nuts

00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:17,030
and bolts of teachers um I breeze

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:19,610
through that basically because with the

00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:22,730
exception of one person here I heard the

00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:26,630
same talk last time and it makes for a

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:29,110
much nicer video so I want to open it up

00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:32,630

00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:34,640
questions in general feel free to ask me

00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,140
or I'm sure my partner wouldn't mind

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:47,650
helping out as he is a better at

00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:47,650
speaking aloud that's features again

00:22:50,980 --> 00:23:05,530

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:05,530

00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:32,670
let's put the word out

00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,670

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:48,580

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:53,740
across all your devices HP Slate and

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:56,650
webos HP as a service leader in cloud

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,360
computing all we do is hosted computing

00:23:56,650 --> 00:24:00,429
to us the cloud is just the next

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,900
generation of hosting and if someone

00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:03,520
who's been in the hosting industry for

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,620
12 years we feel we're in a unique

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,270
position to really help bring these two

00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,100
worlds together is different sets of

00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:11,440
technologies and to help companies

00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,350
embrace this new world in this great new

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,240
tool that allows faster innovation not

00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:18,190
only is it about us being responsive and

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,580
accountable but it's about us doing more
