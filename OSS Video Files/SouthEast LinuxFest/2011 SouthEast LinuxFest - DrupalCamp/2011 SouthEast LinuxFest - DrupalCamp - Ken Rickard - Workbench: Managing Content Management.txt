would like to thank the following

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:29,210
diamond and platinum sponsors in 2011

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,579
for helping make these videos possible

00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:34,020
so are there questions does anyone know

00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:36,860
what this stuff is by the way Murphy

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,760
anyone ever heard of work bench before

00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,050
but you don't know what it is you've

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:41,670
heard of it but you don't know what it

00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,520
is that's awesome that's what we want

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:48,510
we're actually at palantir doing it this

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,920
sort of our dog and pony show and i'll

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,649
say this because i heard someone as I

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,610
when I first got here this afternoon

00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:54,899
someone was saying well I went to some

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,610
of the Drupal stuff in the morning but

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:58,230
it's like a sales patient really made me

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,629
angry this is Linux it's all free and

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:03,480
shared Sheridan why why would anyone

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:04,830
give a sales pitch it's a dog and pony

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,570
show but it's not a sales pitch because

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,890
we're not selling an actual product the

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,600
the funny thing is that one of the other

00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,090
guys at palantir is giving this exact

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,240
same presentation at the exact same time

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:17,939
in Colorado at drupalcamp Colorado he

00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,610
starts Justin's at the same time I do so

00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:24,570
that's kind of fun I'm going to talk a

00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:27,299
little bit about what workbench is why

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,920
we created it how it's released how its

00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,990
managed and then i'm going to show you

00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,369
what it does and how it might make your

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:34,979
life easy how many of you buy do I have

00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:37,590
to do end user support for your Drupal

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,049
sites okay you're going to love this

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,570
stuff because I think that's where the

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,310
the sweet spot is for for work my stuff

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,720
i think our sweet spot for people who

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:50,250
would want to use this are folks doing

00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:53,520
end user support user experience experts

00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,189
who don't like drupal interfaces and

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,110
developers and developers who are trying

00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,750
to appease the first two groups really

00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:02,040
so let's just launch into it i'll give

00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:04,969
you a little bit of background ooh i

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,710
forgot i had fancy transitions and stuff

00:02:04,969 --> 00:02:09,330
so this is this is my great hey what do

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,709
you do people come and they ask me i'm a

00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,000
drupal developer I've been doing the

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:14,630
stuff

00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,190
for a long time I actually made some

00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,810
manner of history and I'm in South

00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:19,250
Carolina so i can say i take

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,610
responsibility for launching the first

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:24,140
newspaper industry website on drupal it

00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,480
was bluffton today Bluffton South

00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:30,700
Carolina lovely coastal town right

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,870
across the river from Hilton Head

00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,730
bluffton exists because hilton head is

00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,910
full you can't buy land on Hilton Head

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:39,620
there's none left so you have bluffton

00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,810
today launched on Drupal four not five

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,610
very briefly and moved to four dot six

00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,700
then we did Savannah now Savannah

00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:50,739
Georgia etc etc this was all way back in

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,690
the dark the dark ages of 2005 2006

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,580
wheel early adopter stuff now I worked

00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:59,030
for a company called palantir got a

00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:00,920
Chicago when people ask me what do you

00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,780
do I say hello we build websites for

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,750
institutional nonprofits okay well what

00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,300
the heck does that mean museums we do a

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,680
lot of museums we do a lot of university

00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:15,620
work and we do a lot of work with now

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,299
public broadcasting and other publishing

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,700
organizations so that's that's really

00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,519
interesting and it plays in a little bit

00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,650
to what we're going to talk about and

00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:25,970
why we take certain approaches how many

00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:28,100
of you by the way work for what I would

00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:33,980
just call institutional nonprofits like

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:36,410
universities and such okay so good

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,820
example of chicago public media chicago

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:40,760
public media is one of the properties i

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:42,350
can talk about they produce a lot of the

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,560
stuff you hear on NPR like what do you

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:47,390
know that's chicago public media big fun

00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,239
stuff This American Life that kind of

00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:54,410
stuff I should point out chicago public

00:03:50,239 --> 00:04:00,079
media actually was built on Drupal 7 dot

00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:01,640
oh it wasn't even an alpha they built

00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:03,860
open source com which is Red Hat's

00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,030
community website it's kind of a fun

00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:11,090
little project this is this is the slide

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,010
I want to grab your attention with how

00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,260
many of you are familiar with working in

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,239
this type of organization with a massive

00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,919
event this isn't terribly complicated as

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:21,020
a for an org chart because there's not a

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:22,910
lot of cross references but does this

00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,250
sort of org chart look familiar to you

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,930
how many of you like

00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,490
work in ldap environments where you have

00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,740
to manage this type of permission

00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:31,060
structure all right you ever tried to

00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:35,500
map this type of permission structure

00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:38,560
onto a CMS you've never even tried you

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,790
just give up don't you oh you just

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,760
haven't gotten there yet well we beat

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:44,740
you to it so this is sort of my jokes

00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,660
like that we deal with a lot of these

00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:47,800
kind of units institutions we just built

00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:53,710
a website and I'll show you here in a

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:55,120
second for dark sea we had six different

00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,650
versions this presentation we just built

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,660
a website for a university that I'll

00:04:56,650 --> 00:05:01,600
talk about here in a second that has a

00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,440
massively complex infrastructure and

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,480
that affects their publishing workflow

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,010
it affects their editing workflow it

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,860
affects everything about their their

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,290
information architecture and it's very

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,090
very challenging in a lot of systems to

00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,280
be able to map that architecture back

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:22,060
onto to to it i'm not just talking about

00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:26,700
drupal so common common problems that

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:29,620
that our clients come up with how do i

00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:31,300
section off parts of my website we can

00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,000
take the southeast Linux conference

00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:36,160
website for example there might be a

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,169
volunteer whose entire job is to update

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,240
the videos section of the website and

00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:41,680
create new videos pages whenever

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,870
possible now you can do that by giving

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,390
them a content type and saying you can

00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,590
only create this content type but what

00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,780
if they have to create things that

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,220
aren't just the video content type but

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,470
you still want them just over in this

00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,080
little section there are some ways to do

00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:57,940
these organic groups I'll do it but

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,070
organic group doesn't give you the sort

00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,460
of access permission hierarchy that we

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:06,100
were just looking at where you have the

00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,680
say the director level person who can do

00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,750
anything in a hierarchy and then you

00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,880
have their sort of underlings and we'll

00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:16,380
look at that a little bit this idea of

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,120
permission inheritance is a big deal to

00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:21,370
extensible workflow States we'll get to

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,320
that a little bit single repository from

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,000
media management media management is a

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,640
huge problem in Drupal and most other

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,160
CMS's we'll talk about that too and then

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:31,210
this is great can i modify and publish

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,870
content without it going live

00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:36,010
immediately what i should say i'm

00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,210
jumping around a little bit and i

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:40,840
apologize

00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,669
we build a lot of websites we do a lot

00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,770
of projects and one of the problems that

00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:46,990
we have in the Drupal world is that

00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,110
clients very frequently and we were just

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,389
talking about this in the hallway right

00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:54,430
hey budget crunch hit Drupal looks a lot

00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:56,259
more attractive than that half a million

00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,419
dollar licensing fee for the software we

00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:02,349
have been using I've done projects that

00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:04,990
had six figure 6 figure 6 figure web

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,210
production budgets that were still

00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,949
smaller than the yearly licensing fee

00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:12,759
than of proprietary software that we

00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:14,949
were replacing this is a big deal the

00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:16,090
problem that comes in when you do these

00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,289
kind of projects and how many of you

00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:20,470
have done those kind of transitional

00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:21,729
projects which you're oh so much fun one

00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,990
of the problems even if you're not

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:24,099
dealing with those kind of transitional

00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,539
projects even if you're just dealing

00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:28,330
with people who are used to editing Word

00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:30,490
documents right is that your

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,810
non-technical users and your even your

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:34,570
technical users but your non-technical

00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:39,180
users in particular bring a ton an

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:41,979
absolute ton of unsung known to them and

00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:45,729
unstated to you expectations about what

00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:48,009
content management actually means right

00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:49,479
we deal with a lot of folks who are

00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:51,789
coming out of these systems that were

00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:56,259
built in the late 90s early 2000s that

00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:58,030
published flat files right and so they

00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:59,650
work in a database to edit their files

00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:01,360
and when they're finally ready for it to

00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:03,669
go to the website they push a button and

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,409
it spits out a flat file right that flat

00:08:03,669 --> 00:08:07,539
file never gets updated so they can do

00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:10,330
18 revisions of the vert of the son of

00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:13,599
the the page but it never goes live

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:15,699
right in a drupal you know or even a

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,789
wordpress model that doesn't exist right

00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:20,409
you make a change in look it goes and

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:23,370
there's this there's no concept of

00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:26,590
natively being able to say well I

00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,680
publish this page but now I want to make

00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,120
some changes but my boss has to approve

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,329
them before I can actually hit the

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,740
publish button right the big problem

00:08:34,329 --> 00:08:38,500
that we run into when we're dealing with

00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,870
with our clients actually is that these

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,610
are unstated expectations that don't

00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:45,160
come up until after we've delivered the

00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:48,730
project and the budgets dead right like

00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,380
hey we're in pre release beta and they

00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,910
try to do their job the way they see it

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,900
and they

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:58,050
wait a minute why can't I do this and

00:08:53,900 --> 00:09:00,360
then we go will you never say you know I

00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:03,420
need to be able to do this or I expect

00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,860
to be able to do this right so when I

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:07,830
talk about these common challenges these

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:12,270
are all things that come up not for one

00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:15,480
client or for you know one weird case

00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,520
but many clients over and over again

00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,520
recurring pain points and I'll show you

00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,200
a list here in a second so this is one

00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,550
of those common things that we get is

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,440
hey I want to map my content to

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:30,330
editorial teams and the editorial teams

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,830
might not have anything to do with the

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:35,190
site information architecture because

00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,800
information architecture maps to public

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,300
views of your content whereas some of

00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,920
the the back end editing

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,490
responsibilities have everything to do

00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,430
with org charts and blame things like

00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,320
that so we might have and will look at

00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,570
our sample when we talk about workbench

00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,400
access we'll talk about our sample which

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,810
is a museum website and the museum

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,820
website is split into three different

00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,830
groups right for the public there's a

00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:00,960
museum there's a library and there's a

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,630
gift shop right three different

00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,190
editorial sections two things right and

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:09,150
you might have people who were in charge

00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:12,000
of just moderating and curating the

00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,860
museum exhibits on the web right and you

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,260
might have people who are in charge of

00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,480
moderating and curating the library

00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,610
content there might be a subset of that

00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,830
library content that's only of interest

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,960
to the staff and so one person might be

00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,010
in charge of this where their boss is in

00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,480
charge of this whole thing does this

00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:31,410
make any sense when they're like sort of

00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:32,820
okay complex sort of multi-level editing

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:34,650
controls that might jump

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,380
responsibilities because of budget cuts

00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,120
right the secretary in the gift shop

00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:42,840
who's responsible for this stuff might

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,460
also be the secretary over here right or

00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:47,490
you might have interns and things like

00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:50,730
that who are responsible for a variety

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:55,770
of things we want to be able to map that

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:57,520
in an efficient model so i have the same

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:01,250
slide twice

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:03,050
we just talked about this so this is

00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:06,080
another map of that same thing right

00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:07,880
these are individual users and this is

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,110
the way if you actually got the client

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:12,890
to explain it this is what they might

00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:14,720
say well you know Kelly is one of our

00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,850
editors and she's in charge of just you

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,700
know these three things well that's odd

00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,920
for her to be in charge of but trying to

00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:25,250
map out these kind of business rules can

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,780
be really really challenging and then

00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,070
supporting these business rules that's

00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:33,710
the other big thing that we want to get

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:36,980
into so wow what am i doing I don't know

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,900
why that went in so Barnard is a good

00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,790
example Barnard University Barnett

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:44,630
college i should say burn our colleges a

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:46,570
women's college associated with columbia

00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:49,490
university is one of the historical

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,340
sister schools of the Ivy League still

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,930
predominantly women I think I think it's

00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:58,490
any way is actually one of the most

00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:02,000
selective and influential private

00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:03,200
schools in the entire universe I don't

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,950
have this part memorized but I'm

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,120
supposed to graduates include Jeanne

00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:14,750
Kirkpatrick former sick former

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:17,320
ambassador to the United Nations what's

00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,610
your name Martha Stewart and there's a

00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:23,390
there's a third big name I'm supposed to

00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:24,650
remember and I can't but this is one of

00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:27,500
those cases where we're coming in and

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,940
replacing a legacy system they have the

00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,080
electronic communications department

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,210
who's actually in charge of running the

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,440
website then they have an IT department

00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,600
that's in charge of making sure the

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,600
website runs which are two separate

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,370
tasks right so the electronic

00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,900
communications part department are in

00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,630
charge of content and the IT department

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:46,130
of course is in charge of servers they

00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:48,260
have 50 academic departments and

00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:50,480
programs they have in the model that i

00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,970
just showed they have 30 different site

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:58,630
sections and they have 200 separate

00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:02,990
editors right in the bar nerd web model

00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:05,270
they have their split across 50

00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:09,110
different domain access installations

00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:10,730
actually their 50 concurrent dot Barnard

00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,620
edu sites running under one

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,870
installation and then there's access

00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,519
controls to each of those individual

00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,769
parts and we'll look at that here in a

00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:22,160
second there's another one of our

00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:25,610
clients mr. slime this is the Field

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,589
Museum yeah yeah this is the opening

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,620
night party at drupalcon Chicago from

00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:33,589
the field museum there's a lot of fun

00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,089
you should have been there so field

00:13:33,589 --> 00:13:36,470
museum has hundreds of scientists and

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:38,570
researchers spread across dozens of

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,040
departments have massive amount of

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:42,500
content and digital assets I mean

00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:46,269
thousands and thousands they have a

00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,040
database the emu database that has a

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:50,630
team you captures data about everything

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,430
in their collection and the stated

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,920
mission of the field museum is to

00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:59,660
collect one or more copies of every

00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,970
living thing on the entire planet mu is

00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,860
a gigantic denormalized database that

00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,949
has millions and millions of records in

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:09,829
it they however had a web staff I think

00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:12,670
when we started up three people right

00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:15,019
three people trying to keep up with

00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,940
hundreds of people and they shouldn't

00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:19,760
certainly couldn't there's this massive

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,680
bottleneck of content waiting to be

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,260
approved or waiting to be translated

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,300
from you know one medium to the web

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,600
medium and they needed tools to make

00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:33,920
that more efficient so hey look it's

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,079
brain nice bright shiny website love the

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,360
t-rex tough sue the t-rex you can follow

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:43,670
sue the t-rex on twitter by the way so

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:48,589
workbench and and here's what i want to

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:51,800
want to say when we started drupal 7 I

00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:54,850
mean the Drupal 7 development process

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,620
was a lot of it was very exciting as

00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,050
part of it we have a lot of core

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:02,029
contributors at palantir but when we

00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:03,769
were at drupalcon san francisco we

00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,230
actually sat down over pizza one night

00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:08,810
and we wrote down a list of all of the

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:11,209
headaches that our clients caused us now

00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:12,649
I say our clients caused us really there

00:15:11,209 --> 00:15:14,899
the headaches that Drupal caused us

00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:18,949
because our clients had actual

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:22,130
expectations of functionality so when we

00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:24,910
talk about workbench workbench is a set

00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:26,740
of editorial tools an extensible set

00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:29,230
editorial tools that are designed to

00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:31,420
make running your day-to-day website

00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:33,130
easier for the people who are really

00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,740
just responsible for making sure that

00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,650
the content is accurate right we

00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:40,540
actually do one of our one of our

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:43,690
smarter people says workbench in many

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,460
cases hides Drupal from people right

00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:48,040
it's designed to be this centralized

00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:52,450
dashboard at the same time under the

00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:55,240
hood what we're doing is I mean this is

00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,250
the actual first feature list that we

00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,620
came up with we sat down and we wrote

00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,750
down everything that people wanted had

00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,090
asked us for in Drupal 6 that we had to

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,340
cobble together and we we listed off

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:07,990
well what modules did we use to make

00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:10,870
that happen how do we make that happen

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:13,570
and the answer is there's like 25 things

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,370
in the right hand column right the

00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:18,070
problem that we kept running into was

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:20,590
those of those 25 things three of them

00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,490
might not work with the other 22 right

00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,950
well number one you don't want to

00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:27,820
install 25 modules to just to do some

00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:31,570
basic stuff right the bigger problem we

00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,400
ran into was that one module might call

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:35,950
something a revision and another module

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,650
might call something and edit one module

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:41,290
might call something published and

00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:47,070
another might call it approved there

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:50,160
were there are workflow and language

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:52,690
disconnects all throughout Drupal

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,850
contributed modules space right when you

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,340
familiar with this problem this problem

00:16:54,850 --> 00:17:00,190
that you have to teach people like six

00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:03,520
different ideas just to get them to do

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:05,500
one task right so this is sort of our

00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:08,890
hit list of how can we make things a

00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:11,170
little simpler right and it was a lot of

00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:15,400
fun actually fun in a very strange

00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:17,890
strange way so at the basics there are

00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,380
three levels to what workbench is about

00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:24,190
when we talk about it access control

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:26,950
file management and continent the really

00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,510
revision moderation right these are at

00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:31,450
the core of what we're trying to do and

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,490
we want to provide a unified sort of

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,059
seamless interface for making all this

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:40,360
happen okay so all right

00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:43,419
that's the back story right so okay the

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,590
rest of the Wow 45 minutes and we're

00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:47,169
going to get out early because it's late

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,519
you know I hate being the last guy we're

00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:52,120
get it we'll get out early if you want

00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:55,120
to so let's take a look this is a test

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:56,470
install there's a little bit of dummy

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,610
content for those of you familiar with

00:17:56,470 --> 00:18:02,940
dville and de Velde val content in here

00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:05,529
i'm going to log in as the librarian and

00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,059
we're going to take a look this is

00:18:05,529 --> 00:18:10,539
Drupal 7 by the way this is native

00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:14,679
Drupal 7 so librarian here is pretty

00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:16,990
limited role librarians and editor and

00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:18,429
the the hierarchy structure that we have

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:21,159
here is one that I showed in the slide

00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:23,529
before there's a museum this is our

00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,450
fictional museum and there are three big

00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:27,789
sections to the side right there's

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:29,529
there's the museum collection there's

00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:32,350
the library section and then there's the

00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:35,580
gift shop the librarian pretty obviously

00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,929
is in charge of library stuff right so

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,999
the first thing that you'll notice of

00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:42,279
course is we have a big fat my workbench

00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:43,779
X icon right up here how many of you

00:18:42,279 --> 00:18:50,619
guys have used Drupal 7 I asked this

00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:53,379
before but so boom all right what do we

00:18:50,619 --> 00:18:56,320
have here a very quick yeah that's my

00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:57,940
grumpy viking photo that's the my wife

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,039
wanted me to take photos in a photo

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:03,490
booth this is another South Carolina

00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:07,269
thing we ran taken and there was a

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,919
little you know what do you costumes or

00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:11,019
costumes to wear so I got a little and

00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:14,769
she didn't think I was having any fun

00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:18,610
and so I said fine I'll make um yeah so

00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:21,789
I made the grumpiest face I could anyway

00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:24,460
so this is just a Content dashboard for

00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:26,740
that user this is actually an extensible

00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,179
page there's a hook for module

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,909
developers out there you can add things

00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:32,350
to or remove to remove things from this

00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:35,669
all this really does is give you three

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:39,429
views and the three default views are

00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:40,690
information about you the quick list of

00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,909
things that you've been working on

00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:45,460
recently and the quick list of things

00:19:42,909 --> 00:19:47,649
that everyone's been working on and one

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,139
thing you'll notice in particular here

00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:51,049
we have this section bit and this has to

00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:52,999
do with a

00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:55,580
says controls right I'm the librarian

00:19:52,999 --> 00:19:57,320
I'm in charge of everything that has to

00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,200
do with the librarian what this column

00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:02,059
is showing me is oh well the employee

00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,340
manual is part of the library staff

00:20:02,059 --> 00:20:07,009
section which is a subset of library

00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,480
therefore falls under your control right

00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:10,940
so this is a quick snapshot of

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:14,480
everything that I might care about right

00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:16,249
and it's divorced in some respect from

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,619
the site information architecture right

00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:20,840
views lets us do this lets us go and

00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:22,460
pull it out of context and prepare it

00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,980
actually in a better context for that

00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:27,379
user so the user only has to look at

00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,139
what they care about right this list in

00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:31,850
particular is hey here are things that

00:20:30,139 --> 00:20:33,499
are you know two of them you'll notice

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,389
are not published they're not live yet

00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,070
that's because they're under moderation

00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:38,450
they have to be approved by someone else

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:42,950
before they can go live and we'll talk

00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:46,399
about that here in a second but the idea

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,830
is hey just show me what I have to do

00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:50,450
right if you know you want to go in and

00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,590
make an edit to a page or you know you

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,129
want to go in and create new content

00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:57,369
that's again what we're trying to do

00:20:54,129 --> 00:21:00,340
tabs across the top again a quick tour

00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:02,989
create content this is actually the same

00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:06,970
create you know content page that Drupal

00:21:02,989 --> 00:21:09,710
core ships with except it's extensible

00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,499
we've already added in the the create

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:15,619
media bit from media module it's part of

00:21:12,499 --> 00:21:17,690
the workbench media integration piece so

00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:20,350
you can add other things here that are

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,820
not necessarily knows there's a patch in

00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:24,350
there was usability testing done at the

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,629
University of Minnesota recently and

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:30,679
they found that when they gave people

00:21:26,629 --> 00:21:33,289
the the task go create a a block in

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,690
the right sidebar everyone went to the

00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:37,820
create content button and then they

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,340
couldn't find how to create a block

00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:43,690
because it's not there so we have a

00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:46,820
patch to add create block to this list

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:49,999
but I'm getting pushed back on it but

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:51,889
we'll see everyone else is there giving

00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:54,590
that the Minnesota presentation at

00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:58,789
drupalcamp Colorado right now so they'll

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:02,230
all get it's a workbench AXA it's a

00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:04,669
workbench patch it's not a core patch

00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,940
there will be stuff spinning out of that

00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:10,420
for

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,420
or I know there will be and I think that

00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:16,460
there's a there's going to be an issue

00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:20,900
tag for it but I can't remember what it

00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:23,030
is it might be like and then you x 2011

00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:24,560
or something like that I'd have to go

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:29,840
look they're going to make some noise

00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:33,890
about it I know so again nice and easy

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,810
stuff there's also hear a file tab that

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:38,510
oh my goodness shows a list of every

00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:40,100
file that was uploaded to the site and I

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,470
didn't actually know that it showed me

00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:46,010
user pictures to that's kind of kind of

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,930
handy and it'll even tell me these were

00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,910
all just auto-generated but it'll even

00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:52,810
tell me what node the picture is

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,280
attached to right so i can find things

00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:57,830
this is pretty crude at the moment but

00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,620
will get more advanced particularly as

00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:03,380
the media module progresses but that

00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:08,420
makes me pretty happy with it is too

00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:10,280
wide for my screen the other thing there

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:11,930
is a my sections tab there's some debate

00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,730
about what that is this just shows the

00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,590
list of things that I'm assigned to from

00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:18,650
an editorial standpoint and here's just

00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,470
showing me that I'm at library but if I

00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:23,630
Ain't I am in my contact in my content

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,940
we can look at content i've edited which

00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,320
by default shows you this is interesting

00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,960
again from a workflow management

00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:33,890
standpoint by default this page shows

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:36,610
you everything that you have edited that

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:40,060
has not been approved for publications

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:42,320
well why was why is this useful right

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:46,370
because it shows you all your unfinished

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:47,690
work and then think about it like hey

00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,460
I'm an editor I want to come in and I

00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,510
want to get something done today oh here

00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:53,210
are the two things that I've got that

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,180
are unfinished why are they unfinished

00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:57,980
right you can go in and figure that out

00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:01,430
so that's really really nice you'll

00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,280
notice here this is again and I'll show

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:06,320
you the admin bit in a second from a

00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:08,540
section perspective I'm in charge of

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,830
library and that's all I've been

00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:13,850
assigned to but we talk about

00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:17,660
hierarchical oops access you'll notice

00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:18,080
that the sections filter here in the

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,179
view

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,690
who actually shows everything underneath

00:24:20,179 --> 00:24:25,190
library in the hierarchy right when we

00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,570
talk about workbench access the

00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,850
difference between it and something like

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,279
organic groups or oddly enough even

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,100
taxonomy access is it taxonomy access

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,440
uses a one-to-one data storage model

00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:39,260
which means if you wanted someone to be

00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:40,789
in charge of these three sections you'd

00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:43,789
have to store all three records in the

00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:47,390
database workbench access doesn't do

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:50,360
that it uses an API to say well if I'm

00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:51,409
in charge of library automatically make

00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,710
me in charge of the everything

00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:58,220
underneath it right that make sense no

00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:59,720
it's it's it's easier to explain to

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,519
people because you and there's less

00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:06,620
boxes to check which makes a lot of

00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:08,120
things a lot easier look at the sort of

00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,500
moderation stuff and this actually if

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,990
you download the module right now you'll

00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,539
beta 5 is the one that's out this

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,850
feature is not in beta 5 mm this is

00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:20,210
we're getting ready to do another it'll

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:24,049
be beta 6 this is designed to be a very

00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:25,970
very simple snapshot of information

00:25:24,049 --> 00:25:28,309
about what you're looking at because

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:31,340
when you start getting into from a

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:34,010
Drupal perspective hey this is a

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:37,100
revision that might be live or it might

00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:39,380
need approval and it you know it's in a

00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:41,929
library section and you can edit it but

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,970
or it's in the in the gift shop X

00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:45,799
section so you can't edit it you know

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,019
people can get confused very very easily

00:25:45,799 --> 00:25:52,429
so what we wanted is a very simple way

00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:54,169
to drop information to clue the user in

00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:55,490
of what they were looking at in wha all

00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,779
right this is actually a block you can

00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,190
drop anywhere so if you don't like it

00:25:56,779 --> 00:25:59,269
here in the user interface you can put

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:01,399
it over here you can put it at the

00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:02,929
bottom of the page I don't care right

00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:05,929
but it tells us oh this is in the

00:26:02,929 --> 00:26:08,750
library staff section oh this is a draft

00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:11,090
it's not published this is the most

00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:13,279
current revision and oh by the way

00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,350
there's a little moderate form right

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:20,360
here and let's see if this works the way

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:21,950
I expect it to yeah this person has no

00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:26,120
permission to get things out of the

00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:28,850
needs review state can't do it like this

00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,480
person the librarian cannot move this

00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:36,210
content to live

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:47,220
right if I go back actually let's go to

00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:50,780
that same node as the admin user yeah

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:57,570
well I can publish that go back here

00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:59,669
refresh this now i'm looking at a

00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,559
published the published version of this

00:26:59,669 --> 00:27:04,169
note right because someone else has

00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:08,820
taken it out of moderation and now it's

00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:10,520
live right and what's interesting again

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,020
from a you user experience perspective

00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,610
we've actually changed the names of the

00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:17,280
tabs across the top which are normally

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:18,809
view and edit right we're trying to give

00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:21,240
a little more contextual data here that

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:23,220
you see in the back view published which

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,390
means view the live version new draft

00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,870
which means hey i'm going to create a

00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:31,010
new draft right as opposed to edit it

00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:32,820
still could use a little bit of work and

00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:37,049
then for those of you who are familiar

00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:39,919
with any of the what six moderation

00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:43,580
modules that were in Drupal in Drupal 6

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,900
pretty straightforward moderation tab

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,370
there's nothing in this one but if I go

00:27:45,900 --> 00:28:01,559
in this is again very very interesting

00:27:49,370 --> 00:28:02,820
live demo typos yay by the way yeah

00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:04,980
telling me you're still in the library

00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:08,760
of staff section this is going to be a

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:11,309
new draft of live content well what does

00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:14,330
that mean well hopefully it what do you

00:28:11,309 --> 00:28:14,330
think that mean by the way

00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:22,559
right this our copy yeah it's

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,509
interesting the sum of the user

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,850
experience testing from Drupal 6 that

00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,889
got into Drupal 7 basically said wow you

00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:30,840
put too much text in your interfaces and

00:28:28,889 --> 00:28:33,600
it confuses the crap out of people so

00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,340
we've tried real hard to strip out

00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,639
extraneous messages and give you

00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,190
contextual messages that actually give

00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:45,109
you the information that you need right

00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:48,659
so the theory is yeah I mean

00:28:45,109 --> 00:28:51,359
conceptually how difficult is that as a

00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:52,950
training task right to explain what that

00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:55,950
little message meet or what that little

00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:57,450
tad mean in terms of moderating of your

00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:59,789
content or the difference between the

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:01,139
live state and the published state it's

00:28:59,789 --> 00:29:03,960
interesting one of the things that we

00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:06,509
noticed we actually install workbench on

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,629
every single site we build actually from

00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:11,429
now on forever but we don't necessarily

00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:13,049
turn on all the modules because we don't

00:29:11,429 --> 00:29:14,820
some of them don't need some of our

00:29:13,049 --> 00:29:16,919
clients don't need the complex workflow

00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,809
stuff all right so I just did a site

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,220
that only has core workbench they're not

00:29:18,809 --> 00:29:22,470
using access control they're not using

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:25,259
the moderation they're just using the

00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:26,609
the user dashboard stuff and it turned a

00:29:25,259 --> 00:29:29,429
two hour training session into a

00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:30,659
20-minute training session because

00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:33,210
instead of having to guide them through

00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,679
menus in this and that and explain all

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,799
kinds of things they don't care about it

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,869
was just click this oh look all right so

00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:46,590
this kind of thing gets us really really

00:29:39,869 --> 00:29:50,039
excited so if I go in and save this AHA

00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,600
now and I didn't actually write this

00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,769
module so I'm I was impressed I didn't

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,629
realize it was going to do this it

00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:59,549
actually takes me to the draft that I

00:29:54,629 --> 00:30:02,309
just did hey this is a draft it's not

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:05,190
published it is the current one and I'm

00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:07,499
on the view draft tab right do you want

00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:13,470
to view the published one right that's

00:30:07,499 --> 00:30:19,769
nice and clear right so hooray and if I

00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:22,019
go back as the admin to this node yeah I

00:30:19,769 --> 00:30:23,700
can see the view draft and if I pull if

00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:25,960
I fire up a third browser by the way

00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,950
let's just double check it

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:32,389
let's make sure it works the way we

00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:39,350
expect fire up a third browser yeah

00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:40,700
employee manual yeah they wouldn't

00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:42,230
normally see the view publish tab but I

00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,889
have dville turned on on this site for

00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:49,129
the anonymous users that's why again as

00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:53,110
an anonymous user it's seamless that

00:30:49,129 --> 00:30:58,120
make sense and that's what we're after

00:30:53,110 --> 00:31:00,620
so you want to see the back end stuff I

00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,509
mean this is basically the editorial

00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:05,330
workflow for for users this is a pretty

00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:08,320
basic user if we go into the moderate

00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,490
tab right now they can see this stuff

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,230
they do have the ability to revert back

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:14,690
to the old live state which is

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,549
interesting and I don't actually know

00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,610
the full extent of how that's being

00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:21,259
controlled I assume anything that was

00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,429
ever a published revision can be

00:31:21,259 --> 00:31:23,809
reverted by someone who has the

00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:25,759
permission that's my assumption but I

00:31:23,809 --> 00:31:29,419
haven't tested it and here's still I

00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:33,889
can't get this out of state gets still

00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:37,460
in this review state which is great got

00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:44,259
a question so far am i jumping around

00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:44,259
too much or going too fast is it

00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:52,250
does it look useful one of the things

00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:54,559
that I want to say about it actually

00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:57,200
before we get into the sort of back end

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:59,900
stuff it goes back to that whole sales

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:04,909
pitch thing we're not building a

00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:09,200
distribution right it's not open atrium

00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:10,970
it's not open scholar it's not any of

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,640
the Drupal distributions it's a series

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,049
of modules that have api's that we're

00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,549
hoping people will use and the thing

00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:18,500
that's got us excited so far is that

00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:20,720
some of the folks on the the user

00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:24,340
experience team are excited about

00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,990
testing out some ideas for Drupal 8 in

00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:29,210
workbench so we've got some decent

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:30,350
usability reviews so far which is fun so

00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:31,880
I'll give you an example of one of the

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:35,240
things we're going to do we're moving

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,390
the delete button we're moving it into a

00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:40,400
tab because there's no way you should

00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:43,850
have a delete node button on the note

00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:47,919
itself edits a tab why the heck is

00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:53,030
delete a button that's just a bad idea

00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:55,880
so okay let's start with access because

00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,580
I wrote the access stuff and part I'm

00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:01,789
most excited about so workbench access

00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,400
is is a slightly different approach and

00:33:01,789 --> 00:33:07,700
if you were at riu itself last year when

00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:09,140
i talked about note access it's not a

00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:11,659
traditional note access module it's one

00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:15,940
of these sexy d7 note access modules

00:33:11,659 --> 00:33:19,370
that uses hook note access to assert

00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,260
grants over individual nodes at the time

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:22,909
you view them so it has no effect on

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,110
node listings which is actually pretty

00:33:22,909 --> 00:33:26,179
important if you're doing site

00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,250
architecture right so it's not going to

00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:30,289
for example segregate things so that

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:32,450
people who are are looking at the

00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:34,669
library website only see library content

00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:36,380
it doesn't do that but when you look at

00:33:34,669 --> 00:33:39,350
a single node that belongs to the

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:41,780
library section then it intercedes and

00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:43,250
says well what's going on here can they

00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:45,049
view it can they edit it can they delete

00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:47,419
it right so it's not a note access

00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:51,770
module it's what I call a content access

00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:54,230
module and if you haven't read Drupal 7

00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:56,210
module development go go buy a copy I'll

00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:58,010
get a little check being

00:33:56,210 --> 00:34:01,370
there's a whole chapter on how this

00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:04,820
stuff works so workbench access is like

00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:08,180
I said an API and it's designed to to be

00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,940
lazy or for you or for developers it's

00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:13,120
designed to be lazy rather than write a

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:17,180
hierarchy management system from scratch

00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:19,250
what I decided to do is actually in

00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:20,870
Drupal 6 we already had taxonomy access

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,360
control which actually isn't truly

00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,370
hierarchical and I had written a module

00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,840
called menu node edit which should have

00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:29,240
been called menu access but someone

00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,740
stole the namespace on me two days

00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:36,350
before i was going to release they stole

00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:39,200
the namespace on me sigh so all i do is

00:34:36,350 --> 00:34:41,870
i provide plug-ins for other systems

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,950
that create hierarchies already the two

00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,410
that are currently has supported our

00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:47,450
menu and tax on right so i just

00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:49,220
piggyback on you know all that

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:50,840
drag-and-drop taxonomy you know

00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:53,570
hierarchy creation stuff that drupal

00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,990
already does I just graphed on to it and

00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:59,660
say okay for your hierarchy describe it

00:34:56,990 --> 00:35:01,670
to work bench access in the way that I

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:04,490
can understand it so I could use it to

00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,140
administer my permissions all right you

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:07,550
can actually hear from the this is the

00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:10,730
settings screen which you will probably

00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,680
never use which is kind of fun you can

00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:14,300
switch between menu and taxonomy I don't

00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,070
recommend you do it in production but

00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:20,540
you can you can have more than one

00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:23,690
vocabulary active at a time which is

00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:25,520
kind of interesting if you need to two

00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,440
things down here these are kind of

00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,320
interesting this automated section

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,240
assignment we'll talk about in a second

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:34,570
has to do with if this is checked which

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,740
and it's checked by default now

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:41,180
everything in your hierarchy becomes an

00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,890
editorial section if you uncheck it then

00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,450
you can turn certain things off and

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:46,970
we'll look in a second and figure out

00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:48,350
why that might be interesting and then

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,560
this is just a little thing we put in

00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:52,730
for the UX people so that you can name

00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,550
it whatever you want to when we're

00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,020
talking about it in the user interface

00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:59,360
for our early clients like barnard it

00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,350
says workbench access all over the place

00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:03,470
and I said no we want to call it

00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:05,630
sections or we want to call it I don't

00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:08,960
know those the only two words I have for

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,010
it which made it configurable so the

00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,800
other parts do this

00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:15,890
interface are the sections overview and

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,070
now I have automated section assignments

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:23,420
running so that means everything that's

00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:24,980
in my vocabulary is automatically a

00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:34,280
section and it might make sense if I

00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:35,720
went real quick this is my acta this is

00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,030
my when I say we're piggybacking on

00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:40,820
other systems this is the taxonomy for

00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,260
the museum right and workbench access

00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:44,990
will actually create this for you as a

00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:48,020
demo if you ask it to which is kind of

00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:52,810
helpful so if we went in and said oh

00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:55,820
let's add a new term and we'll call it

00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:58,400
linux because we're doing Linux e things

00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:01,100
well the rest of the week we're doing

00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,780
leah clinic see things and i'll save

00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:07,490
that and i'll go back to the list and

00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:11,330
where to go and linux will be its own

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:14,650
thing sure what the heck and now cross

00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:19,790
my fingers will go back to sections

00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:21,790
there it is linux is automatically now

00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:24,380
assigned as an editorial section right

00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:28,430
which is kind of cool if i actually turn

00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:30,370
off the auto assignment well hey let me

00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:35,720
turn off the auto assign just do that

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:39,650
turn that off save that now now that i

00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:42,230
got it turned off if i go here this is

00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:44,770
my linux section it'll ask me if you

00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:47,750
want it to be an authorial section

00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:50,750
that's kind of nice now why would you do

00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:53,960
that that is the question now part of

00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:56,150
the point 22 piggybacking on existing

00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:58,670
hierarchy systems so that we don't have

00:37:56,150 --> 00:38:01,640
to retrain our users to learn other form

00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:04,250
elements currently we do currently

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,150
workbench access because field api makes

00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,860
things a little more complicated

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,170
currently workbench access actually

00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:10,880
makes its own access control form

00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:14,390
element on the note editing form we saw

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,340
it very briefly in the next Rev once I

00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,800
get time to write the patch we're going

00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:20,930
to piggyback on native node forms which

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,330
means if you taught someone how to use

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:24,920
taxonomy tagging for your site

00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:26,240
they can automatically use access

00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,890
control or if you taught somebody how to

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,940
put things in the menu system they can

00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:35,720
automatically use access control right

00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:36,980
so in the future imagine that this is

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,380
your actual site information

00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:42,560
architecture right well you may decide

00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:44,720
that this kind of granular control

00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,390
really matters for the exhibits in the

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,820
library but the gift shop it who cares

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,380
right it's minor so you can just disable

00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:53,270
these two things to remove them from

00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,210
user interfaces to prevent confusion

00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:57,860
right because less options are easier to

00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,420
deal with right but the only person who

00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,550
ever has to make that decision or deal

00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,940
with it is the person to administering

00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:06,080
these permissions that makes sense so

00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:07,490
it's probably a feature that you'll

00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,160
never use but it's nice to have because

00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:13,400
it's there or it's there because it's

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,140
nice to have the irony is actually this

00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,430
is the way I originally architected it

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:22,370
and then our usability guys were like

00:39:18,430 --> 00:39:23,930
why would I want to turn anything off so

00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,380
I said fine I'll enable them all by

00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:29,950
default but if you wanted the advance

00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:33,020
you know feature you certainly could

00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:36,170
okay so the other two things that you

00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:38,180
can do and this is fun is there are two

00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:39,260
different screens for assigning

00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,930
permissions right now and these are

00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:44,150
pretty basic but they work and I like

00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:46,660
that they were we were looking at

00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:51,590
library let's do linux oh what the heck

00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:56,380
you can assign new editors by individual

00:39:51,590 --> 00:40:00,410
users so I have a user with the

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:02,090
fascinating name of contributor right we

00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:04,520
just added the contributor is now an

00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:09,290
editor to this section right but you can

00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:12,200
also do editors by entire roles which as

00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,720
a site administrator makes your job much

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:17,090
much easier right because you just go in

00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,310
and say oh fine anyone who's an editor

00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:22,160
can edit this thing right I know it'll

00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:25,100
tell you who they are and why they can

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:30,320
why are they here essentially and that's

00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:32,210
really nice very exciting you can even

00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,130
if you are crazy because somebody asked

00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:36,480
me about this

00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:40,080
what if you want anonymous users to

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,180
create content someone's already doing

00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,010
this and i love i love it when people

00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,770
ask questions and the answer is oh just

00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,420
do this and this he said we're running a

00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:50,490
website where the southeast Linux

00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,530
festival website we got people doing

00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,000
videos right but we have a job board and

00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:56,070
we want anonymous users to be able to

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,920
post unpublished content to the job

00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:01,860
board that is then approved and goes

00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,200
live workbench actually makes that

00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:08,190
really really easy to do in fact it'll

00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:10,710
be a great demo site anyway there's

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:16,050
actually a permission in here called do

00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:19,670
you allow all members of this role to be

00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:22,050
assigned to work bench access sections

00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:23,640
all right you want to assign anonymous

00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:26,370
users because here's the way it works

00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:30,420
once once we declare that there's an

00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:32,130
access control scheme in place I start

00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,990
asserting rules which means if you try

00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,070
to create content and you're not

00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:40,320
assigned to a section you're locked out

00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:42,930
right which is by design right now

00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:46,200
imagine and I can see this coming it's

00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:48,780
coming imagine i get to map that instead

00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:52,560
of to an internal hierarchy like drupal

00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:56,430
editorial drupal taxonomy what if I map

00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,990
that to ldap groups it's not actually

00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,090
that hard it's just a matter of

00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:01,890
translating it through the API be a

00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,400
question of hey can I query for these

00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:10,020
ldap boobs I assume ldap has hierarchies

00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:11,760
they must right anyone know yeah so if I

00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:13,320
can query ldap and get the hierarchy

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,900
structure I can translate that into a

00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:18,840
language that workbench access

00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,880
understands and then instead of going in

00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:23,160
and saying well you know assign it to a

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,110
taxonomy you just go in and say no no

00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,480
assign it to the proper ldap group or

00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:29,430
whatever you end up calling it or even

00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,220
better we write a small module just do

00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:34,680
it automatically oh look John is editing

00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:37,050
content John is in the biology

00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:41,490
department ldap group all his contents

00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:45,210
going in that department done right and

00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:46,380
as a developer if I've done things

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,410
correctly that shouldn't take you more

00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:54,229
than a day

00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:58,559
shouldn't it might but it shouldn't so

00:42:54,229 --> 00:43:01,710
that's kind of cool other questions

00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:05,220
about this sort of permissions stuff and

00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:08,849
again what's interesting let's look at

00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:10,529
my librarian again here oh the librarian

00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:12,329
I just added the librarian to linux so

00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:13,979
that's good so if I go in as the

00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:16,799
librarian and I want to create content

00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:20,430
again I'm going to create an article and

00:43:16,799 --> 00:43:23,369
it says okay you're part of the library

00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,589
group where do you want it to go and

00:43:23,369 --> 00:43:32,069
you're part of the Linux group too

00:43:24,589 --> 00:43:34,739
though nice and we could do it silently

00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:36,690
if we chose to that would be evil just

00:43:34,739 --> 00:43:40,019
auto assign that stuff but we don't

00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:43,259
right now the next thing that's coming

00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:45,029
by the way there's a patch was not a

00:43:43,259 --> 00:43:46,200
high priority to us but other people

00:43:45,029 --> 00:43:48,180
might like it the next thing that's

00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,569
coming is the ability to assign this to

00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:53,190
more than one editorial group at a time

00:43:50,569 --> 00:43:54,630
right which is part of supporting the

00:43:53,190 --> 00:44:00,349
native you'll notice this actually

00:43:54,630 --> 00:44:00,349
doesn't use the native taxonomy form

00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:04,829
because again field API makes it

00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,029
complicated but before I can do that I

00:44:04,829 --> 00:44:09,960
have to be able to support multiple

00:44:06,029 --> 00:44:12,089
section assignments and sometimes we're

00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,700
on budgets other people determine so

00:44:12,089 --> 00:44:17,569
that features there's a patch it sit in

00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:20,910
the key waiting for people to review it

00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:22,410
so that's again workbench access again

00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:24,029
you set up your sections you can set

00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:26,670
them up however you want you assign

00:44:24,029 --> 00:44:29,029
users or roles to them one of the

00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:36,809
interesting things to note by the way so

00:44:29,029 --> 00:44:40,859
by role let's see by roll the librarian

00:44:36,809 --> 00:44:42,540
is member of the Linux group if I were

00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:50,160
to let me go on

00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:52,650
I can I can use my own interface because

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,400
of the way things are architected if you

00:44:52,650 --> 00:45:02,460
say the librarian is a member by account

00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:10,920
and then you take the role away and that

00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:16,950
person is a contributor it does not how

00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:18,570
I missed it up again darn it revoking

00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:21,950
the role permission does not revoke the

00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:27,420
user permission and that's by design

00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:29,280
right user you know what's the rule the

00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,310
rule would be specific permissions

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:34,980
override general provisions and that's

00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:36,960
very Linux isn't it yeah it did

00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:41,400
something right in Linux world gay okay

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:44,520
so it's a good moderation real fast the

00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,570
moderation stuff if anyone ever somebody

00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,370
mentioned this earlier when we were

00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:50,040
talking about in the hallways ever dealt

00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:55,080
with moderation in Drupal 6 in

00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:59,400
particular it's a real ugly beast there

00:45:55,080 --> 00:46:03,930
are probably three good modules that are

00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:06,810
eighty percent finished that don't play

00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:08,760
nicely together we were again on time

00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,530
and on budget we ended up doing a fork

00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:13,470
of the content moderation module from

00:46:10,530 --> 00:46:15,570
Drupal 6 largely because the developer

00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:19,740
wasn't interested in working on Drupal 7

00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:21,510
at the time so and its code was the

00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,190
cleanest I believe I wasn't actually

00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:24,660
involved in decision so we took it over

00:46:23,190 --> 00:46:26,310
well we didn't take it over we just

00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:28,230
forked it we forked it and is now its

00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:30,930
own thing and I should also point out

00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:33,000
that all of these modules workbench

00:46:30,930 --> 00:46:35,610
moderation workbench access workbench

00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,050
files workbench media & workbench itself

00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:41,580
are all released separately they're not

00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:43,140
a one big bundle and while you get the

00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:45,120
dashboard by installing the workbench

00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:47,870
module you can run workbench moderation

00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,190
workbench access by themselves I

00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:52,070
wouldn't I would always download the

00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,180
primary workbench module but you can

00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:56,369
which is kind of interesting so

00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:59,759
workbench moderation gives you

00:46:56,369 --> 00:47:00,960
extensible workflow States right one of

00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:02,720
the limitations to this of course is

00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,160
that these are linear workflow States

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,410
but they are very very flexible and

00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:13,109
they're very flexible in large part

00:47:07,410 --> 00:47:16,049
because every state you define creates

00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:17,940
its own permission right and the

00:47:16,049 --> 00:47:21,410
permission excuse me I've got that wrong

00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:24,930
that's not true there's another stage

00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:28,529
there are states and then there are

00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:31,230
transitions excuse me and every

00:47:28,529 --> 00:47:34,349
transition has its own permission right

00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:38,930
so my librarian can actually move things

00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:38,930
from draft to needs review but that's it

00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:44,759
or can move things from these review to

00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,700
draft you could have a state let's make

00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:49,440
one sure what the heck we'll make a

00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:54,029
state that says no no you can move from

00:47:49,440 --> 00:48:00,869
draft to published because we want you

00:47:54,029 --> 00:48:03,059
to break things all right matter it

00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:05,970
moderate from draft to published and

00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:12,529
that was a contributor sure what the

00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:18,690
heck all right so now when I go back

00:48:12,529 --> 00:48:21,390
here to view this draft oh look I can

00:48:18,690 --> 00:48:23,339
make it go live right now all right this

00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,869
is again for those of you who don't use

00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:25,890
Drupal much I mean this is the kind of

00:48:24,869 --> 00:48:27,900
thing that gets a lot of people really

00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:29,519
excited about Drupal hey look I made one

00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,220
really really simple change through a

00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:36,920
user interface and enabled this whole

00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:39,509
new set of features for people right so

00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:44,220
the moderation stuff is really really

00:48:39,509 --> 00:48:45,690
powerful because of that so yeah you can

00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,989
have different workflow States which is

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:53,130
great and then Rebecca white who's the

00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:57,890
developer on this also created this

00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:59,970
little tool that will get more advanced

00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:02,670
this stuff gets very conceptually

00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,559
difficult to keep straight so she built

00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,210
a little permission checker to make sure

00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,130
that you've configured things correctly

00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:12,780
so that people can do what you expect

00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:16,220
to do which i think is kind of cool so

00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:16,220
the question is Nia can a contributor

00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:25,680
publish moderate content of the article

00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:27,630
type no and so it actually gives you a

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:30,330
message here's things that fail to

00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:32,540
permission check but this kind of

00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:35,370
flexibility is really really exciting

00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:37,380
now the other thing that I noted is that

00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:39,290
this is stuff that came out of a sort of

00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:42,680
group conversation that we had at

00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:45,410
leading up to drupalcon San Francisco

00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,700
you'll notice this is a very linear flow

00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:50,880
right you just move you can move things

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,320
from state to state and that's an

00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,910
interesting editorial model but it's not

00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:56,310
the only editorial model this is where I

00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:59,490
get excited we got a new guy in our

00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:02,070
office Steve parsh and on his first day

00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:04,350
we had a workbench developers meeting

00:50:02,070 --> 00:50:06,660
and we were whiteboarding stuff and we

00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:08,250
were talking about this when Steve came

00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:09,770
up with the following module that is yet

00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,870
to be written but needs to be written

00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,400
it's the workbench approval model module

00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:17,940
and what does the workbench approval

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:21,630
model do module do it creates an

00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:25,590
approval tab on every node that sets up

00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:28,050
a synchronous nonlinear approvals before

00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:30,240
content can go live what the hell does

00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:32,040
that mean that means let's say that you

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,780
work for a gigantic university right and

00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,400
you have an HR department and you have a

00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:37,920
legal department and you have a

00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,870
technical expert for everything that has

00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,050
to get reviewed that goes live on your

00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:44,340
website so it's got to be checked for

00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:46,050
political correct language by the HR

00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:47,580
departments got to be correct for legal

00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:50,190
liabilities by the legal department and

00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:52,230
some tech expert has to actually read oh

00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:54,420
and then an editor has to approve its

00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:56,310
grammar so you've got four people well

00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,250
we could run it through work flow States

00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:00,870
but that will get complicated real quick

00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:04,260
so Steve's idea was no I just want to

00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:06,270
tab that I can go to that says well

00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:08,460
you're you're authorized to be a legal

00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:10,050
reviewer of this content no legal

00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:14,790
reviewer has approved it yet do you

00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:16,260
approve yes and then we can build views

00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,060
off that sort of thing right so when you

00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:20,600
go into your workbench dashboard as the

00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:22,610
lawyer hey what

00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:35,780
what new content is waiting for me that

00:51:22,610 --> 00:51:39,530
needs legal approval oh yeah we you mean

00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:41,780
like you want an email I don't think so

00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:44,060
because that requires actions

00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:47,600
integration yes oh excuse me the

00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:50,540
question was yeah this is like the most

00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:52,040
helpful room guy I've ever had we've

00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,630
never had that I've never I've done a

00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,870
lot of easy we've never had the

00:51:53,630 --> 00:52:00,410
questions in any way the question was I

00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:02,810
want to get email notifications or some

00:52:00,410 --> 00:52:04,130
of some right I don't want to just log

00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:06,680
in every day and look I want to get a

00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:08,990
notification if something occurs that I

00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:12,350
need to respond to and the answer to

00:52:08,990 --> 00:52:14,690
that is triggers and actions will allow

00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:17,150
for that and I don't believe we have

00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:23,590
integration for that yet but it's fairly

00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:23,590
trivial sure

00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:49,250
right so there the question was

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:51,530
essentially there's an approval right

00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:54,080
that and that's so yeah a

00:52:51,530 --> 00:52:57,560
non-hierarchical approval process by

00:52:54,080 --> 00:53:00,260
which for something to go live a single

00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:01,460
person in the same in a category has to

00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:03,260
be able to prove it and I think that

00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,690
goes to the workbench approval module

00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:07,580
that we're just sort of describing that

00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:08,930
and when I described it I said you know

00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,550
there's a legal reviewer and there's a

00:53:08,930 --> 00:53:12,170
you know a technical review and there's

00:53:10,550 --> 00:53:14,810
a grammar review or well you might just

00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:17,410
have one bucket a peer reviewer ap or

00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:19,790
must sign off on this that is not you

00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:23,390
that's fine that and that shouldn't be

00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:28,220
very hard to implement it shouldn't be

00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:31,040
hard at all really because what you

00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:35,080
would end up doing right is the only

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:37,940
trick to that workflow model really is I

00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:39,560
suppose when the last person approves it

00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:42,920
they'll get it would you like to publish

00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:44,690
this button it would essentially be you

00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,520
know you go to the to the approval page

00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:49,220
and be like yes no one in this bucket

00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:51,950
has approved it yet people in these

00:53:49,220 --> 00:53:53,390
other buckets have and actually if

00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:55,010
you've ever submitted content to the

00:53:53,390 --> 00:53:57,500
Drupal watchdog magazine they have

00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:00,260
something similar to this although it's

00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:03,260
not automated but they have they they do

00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:05,480
reviews of your content according to

00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:07,070
these disorder categories be like oh no

00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:12,440
one no one has reviewed this for grammar

00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:14,720
yet but what's interesting and the

00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:17,030
reason I sort of asked what people are

00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:18,860
interested in and we're doing this talk

00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,970
again at drupalcon london and i think in

00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,860
london we're going to start trying to

00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:23,900
recruit more user experience folks

00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,690
because the question the answer to the

00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,480
question you're asking is not a

00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:33,860
technical answer it's a what's the best

00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:35,270
way to present that to you right and so

00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:37,250
I keep finding myself an issue key is

00:54:35,270 --> 00:54:40,370
going and saying like can you sketch it

00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:42,080
on a napkin or can you can you explain

00:54:40,370 --> 00:54:44,220
to me the workflow you really really

00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,590
want and so one is

00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:48,750
this is a really cool one would be hey

00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:51,510
something new or something changed that

00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:53,900
I'm in charge of I want to get an email

00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:57,960
and then I want to be able to approve it

00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:59,790
immediately and that's the sort of thing

00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,660
we need and yet what do the interfaces

00:54:59,790 --> 00:55:03,140
look like one of the big challenges

00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:09,060
that's coming up in the access control

00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:11,010
world for this is right now all those

00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:12,570
hierarchical permissions it doesn't

00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:15,530
matter what type of node you're looking

00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:18,300
at it just doesn't matter I don't care

00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:20,490
not because I can't do it but because

00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:23,250
the user interface for trying to assign

00:55:20,490 --> 00:55:25,590
those fine grained permissions is really

00:55:23,250 --> 00:55:27,930
really complicated because you can

00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:29,430
imagine a world and I know people who

00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:32,359
are going to want this because I've

00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:35,940
already talked to them where you have

00:55:32,359 --> 00:55:37,980
the mode we're back to the southeast

00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:40,590
linux festival website right we have the

00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:43,200
jobs board we have the video page and we

00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:45,270
have the conference schedule bit right

00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,440
and we have a user and we'll call this

00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:51,900
user Jane and Jane should be able to

00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,930
publish job notices in the job section

00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:58,140
that's a Content time and Jane should be

00:55:54,930 --> 00:56:00,810
able to edit all other content types in

00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:04,619
the video section but not publish new

00:56:00,810 --> 00:56:07,170
content in the video section you can

00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:09,630
actually right now implement one hook in

00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:12,930
your own custom code and override that

00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:14,910
behavior very very easily there's just

00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,440
no user interface for it because trying

00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:19,500
to come up with the proper user

00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,930
interface for I want to have granular

00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,990
permissions / content type per section

00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:26,160
is a freaking nightmare right and one of

00:56:24,990 --> 00:56:27,869
the places where drupal traditionally

00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:29,940
falls down and I had a very honest

00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:33,330
conversation with a potential client on

00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:35,490
Friday I said drupal user interfaces are

00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:38,010
guilty of the following thing they are

00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:41,099
great until you get more than about 20

00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:43,349
things in them let's in the blocks page

00:56:41,099 --> 00:56:44,760
is a good example or that or this page

00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:47,119
you imagine what this page would look

00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:52,560
like if we had 20 moderation states

00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:55,260
right so i don't know and i literally

00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:56,220
would say i don't know let me find my

00:56:55,260 --> 00:57:05,000
cursor

00:56:56,220 --> 00:57:08,190
I don't know how to build this page I

00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:10,670
think I know how to build it because at

00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:14,609
this point I am only looking at museum

00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:16,500
right but what is it here I will talk a

00:57:14,609 --> 00:57:21,470
little bit about another limitation that

00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:24,180
Drupal has in my head in my twisted head

00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:26,430
Drupal core has the crud hooks there are

00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,780
four states for any piece or four

00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:32,300
actions you can perform on a piece of

00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:36,119
content view create view edit and delete

00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:38,070
that's not enough I also think there's a

00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:40,740
preview which means I want to be able to

00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:42,960
view the unpublished version there's a

00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:45,720
revised I can't remember what my third

00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:47,160
one was but they're actually hard to let

00:57:45,720 --> 00:57:56,340
me look they're hard coded in in the

00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:57,840
module I forgot what it was and I need

00:57:56,340 --> 00:58:00,810
to submit a patch for this with Drupal 8

00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:08,670
is the problem is in Drupal core these

00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:10,050
things are hard-coded publish yeah I

00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:13,800
think publish should actually be a

00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:16,440
permission I mean think about it so yeah

00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:18,060
in Drupal core only these four things

00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:21,240
get run through note access and there's

00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:23,099
actually a whitelist right you can't run

00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,200
any other operation through note access

00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:27,540
it just doesn't work and one of my

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,609
challenges for Drupal 8 is to figure out

00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:32,670
how many of these things to get into

00:58:29,609 --> 00:58:35,099
core and or how to make cores access

00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:37,980
model extensible because right now again

00:58:35,099 --> 00:58:39,839
there's a whitelist even better it's a

00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:41,550
statically cached white list of results

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:44,040
which makes things really really

00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:45,359
complicated but when you look at we

00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,070
actually look at the way people behave

00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:49,080
and like I said those sort of unspoken

00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:51,450
expectations of what content management

00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,359
actually means no there are kind of

00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:55,950
these seven different things right well

00:58:54,359 --> 00:58:59,070
people will go what's the difference

00:58:55,950 --> 00:59:01,290
when update and revise well update means

00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:04,200
I want to create a new copy of things

00:59:01,290 --> 00:59:06,599
revised means I want to switch from

00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,819
version to version of the published

00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:11,979
content that's what it means to me

00:59:09,819 --> 00:59:13,839
you know what's the difference what

00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:17,199
preview for there's a preview button

00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:18,489
doesn't know preview means you have the

00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,969
permission to view something that no one

00:59:18,489 --> 00:59:23,859
else can view right and it's weird

00:59:21,969 --> 00:59:25,719
because we sort of have that permission

00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:28,329
in Drupal core but we don't really have

00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:30,069
that permission in Drupal cool you can

00:59:28,329 --> 00:59:31,719
look in the note action node access

00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:33,039
function and find out and yeah the idea

00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:35,499
that we have a delete button but not a

00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:38,140
publish button is a you user experience

00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:39,099
a nightmare right so we have like three

00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:41,289
minutes left are there any other

00:59:39,099 --> 00:59:51,009
questions or should we just go and enjoy

00:59:41,289 --> 00:59:53,859
the rest of the day yeah we're using ck

00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:56,190
editor on everything and it has a paste

00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:58,569
from word excuse me the question was

00:59:56,190 --> 01:00:01,089
have you found a WYSIWYG editor that

00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:02,709
protects against the that I'm going to

01:00:01,089 --> 01:00:06,339
editorialized protects against the

01:00:02,709 --> 01:00:09,940
demonic crap that paste from word forces

01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:11,769
on the web applications ck most of the

01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:13,809
modern WYSIWYG libraries handled that

01:00:11,769 --> 01:00:17,559
decently well the problem is there's a

01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:20,380
paste from word button that performs

01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:22,449
clean up when it translates what the

01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,459
user inputs before it shoves it in a

01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:29,410
Drupal and you have to train people to

01:00:24,459 --> 01:00:32,199
use it yeah that's again part of the

01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:34,299
whole workbench process for us again as

01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:36,849
people who develop and maintain sites

01:00:34,299 --> 01:00:40,029
for people is standardization of what

01:00:36,849 --> 01:00:41,739
we're doing right and so it's similar to

01:00:40,029 --> 01:00:44,849
an install profile everyone gets ck

01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:47,559
editor right everyone gets workbench

01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:49,839
whether or not they get moderation or or

01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:51,519
access is a different thing but it also

01:00:49,839 --> 01:00:53,349
leads to some really fun conversations

01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,739
right i was doing training for a client

01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:59,319
and I was showing them workbench and we

01:00:56,739 --> 01:01:00,729
got two minutes left showing them

01:00:59,319 --> 01:01:01,809
workbench and they were excited and we

01:01:00,729 --> 01:01:03,459
started to go through publishing

01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:05,680
workflows and someone in the training

01:01:03,459 --> 01:01:08,920
session went well how do I make a change

01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:10,359
without editing what's live and I said

01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,729
well you know we didn't install that

01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:14,469
feature for you because we don't you

01:01:12,729 --> 01:01:16,809
don't need it unless you really really

01:01:14,469 --> 01:01:18,519
need it so we should talk about that but

01:01:16,809 --> 01:01:21,069
it'll take about ten minutes to get you

01:01:18,519 --> 01:01:22,170
up and running with that and they're

01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:24,480
doing it now

01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:26,490
like turned it on behind my back started

01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,250
running it they're revising everything

01:01:26,490 --> 01:01:31,980
and having that kind of power is really

01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:34,610
really really help take one more

01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:37,610
question if there is one more question

01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:37,610
yeah

01:01:59,450 --> 01:02:04,110
right so there's two questions here one

01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:07,050
is about the ownership of content pages

01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,790
right there's someone who owns or is

01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:10,890
ultimately responsible for that page and

01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:12,360
the other is about the scheduled

01:02:10,890 --> 01:02:14,250
revision of those pages and sort of

01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:18,030
notifying the owner hey this thing is

01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:20,400
potentially out of date right it's

01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:22,080
interesting again these are things that

01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,820
we've had to deal with before I built a

01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,720
website in Drupal 6 that was very very

01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:30,000
painful that had the following concept

01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:31,800
it uses used that section thing for

01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,960
editorial control but then every page

01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:36,120
could also have an owner and the page

01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:38,370
owner might not even be able to edit it

01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:42,660
but got notified every time it was

01:02:38,370 --> 01:02:46,220
changed yeah yeah and typically that was

01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:48,840
a department head who had underlings

01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,100
actually doing things I think that's

01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,080
important that's actually pretty easy to

01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:55,380
do it's again just a sort of a user

01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:58,380
interface question and and the second

01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:02,070
part to that question was the hey it's

01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:03,180
getting stale it's been six months then

01:03:02,070 --> 01:03:04,530
you actually know if there's a module

01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:05,670
for that yet because there should be I

01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,710
don't think there is i mean there's a

01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:10,050
scheduler module which says i want this

01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:12,270
thing to go live on july 4th and come

01:03:10,050 --> 01:03:15,180
down on july seventh but there's nothing

01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:17,190
that says i want this person to be

01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:18,360
notified six months from that although

01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,760
we've already gotten that feature

01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:23,070
request now the way we handle this in

01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:27,900
the workbench world is everything we've

01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:29,850
built is modular and uses views and so

01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,120
it should be very very easy to just sort

01:03:29,850 --> 01:03:34,920
of insert that into what's already there

01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:36,900
right so that you then can can have a

01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,810
view that says you know show me

01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:43,170
everything that's getting stale all

01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:44,640
right so yeah that's good you're going

01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:46,800
to throw that in the issue queue that's

01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,570
a good that probably gets spun off into

01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:50,460
its its own module again it's one of

01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:55,320
those things that I'm shocked doesn't

01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:57,210
exist but anyway thank you for your time

01:03:55,320 --> 01:04:01,850
in your attention it is a five o'clock

01:03:57,210 --> 01:04:01,850
which means it's time to go thank you

01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:17,079
what about this I can help you like it

01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:20,220
we have the same problem or whatever to

01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:20,220
do you think the idea

01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:26,700
that's not the word out

01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,700
you

01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:42,680
webos nos that works the way that you do

01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:47,840
across all your devices HP Slate and

01:04:42,680 --> 01:04:50,750
webos HP as a service leader in cloud

01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:52,460
computing all we do is hosted computing

01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,560
to us the cloud is just the next

01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:56,000
generation of hosting and if someone

01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,620
who's been in the hosting industry for

01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:59,720
12 years we feel we're in a unique
