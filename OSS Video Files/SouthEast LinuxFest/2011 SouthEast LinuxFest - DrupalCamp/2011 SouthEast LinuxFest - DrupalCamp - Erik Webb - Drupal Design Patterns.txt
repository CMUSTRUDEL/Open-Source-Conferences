the following presentation was recorded

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,870
at the 2011 southeast linux fest in

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:11,370

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,029
pc org the southeast linux fest would

00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,180
like to thank the following diamond and

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:32,399
platinum sponsors in 2011 for helping

00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:36,780
make these videos possible 10 15 s start

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:43,469
time right good alright so it's going to

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:48,059
get started alright so my sessions

00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:50,579
called learn to learn to be a coding

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,190
rockstar I keep changing it until

00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:55,129
marketing so I just passed her own

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,180
devcloud subscriptions for everyone

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:01,410
definitely worth checking out against

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:03,480
three months trial can't lose i also

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,210
have a whole bunch of other give other

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,070
goodies to give away and all kind of

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:09,750
stuff we're hiring that crazy so if

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,220
you're interested come see me either

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,409
between these sessions or after my

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,630
second session we'll talk we're hiring

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,780
for everything from sales marketing

00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,979
support consulting engineering

00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:26,420
absolutely everything think of alright

00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:30,840
so this is basically focused around

00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:33,180
doing what i call triple design patterns

00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,430
it's not design patterns and the typical

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,200
coding sense but it's things you see

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,439
over and over and drupal things that are

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,630
really helpful for getting really

00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,549
efficient code and just following along

00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:46,320
lines of how everyone else is developing

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,829
it so you can sort of start on the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,320
common playing field i'm a technical

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,930
consultant aqua i focused primarily on

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,130
best practices in the greater sense of

00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,829
the word and as well as infrastructure

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:00,600
setup i've been working with drupal for

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,119
a little over almost four years now

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,630
actually i've been doing PHP for about

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,090
10 years and i'm a red hat admin for

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,310
about the last six seven years so i have

00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,970
a pretty wide a range of the whole

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,110
drupal ecosystem

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:19,470
so there's five things I want to talk

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,209
about one creating your own hooks also

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,879
how do you static variables this is

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:25,769
something again all of these examples

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,200
are just things I rarely see people

00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:30,750
using and all the clients i go to just

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,450
really good performance things they

00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,640
could be doing but aren't so this is my

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,730
way of sort of imparting that back on

00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,769
other people also using Drupal's cash

00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:42,720
this is another one that i think there's

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,690
sort of a fear around it or people just

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,010
aren't comfortable using it it's really

00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:49,440
not that hard and we'll go through some

00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:53,459
examples how to effectively store

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,290
objects in the database so basically how

00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,560
to effectively write to the database

00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:00,540
without writing field by field and just

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,819
these huge sequel commands don't not

00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:04,409
having to write those by hand and also

00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:06,540
making the most of menus so there's a

00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,940
couple of menu tricks that i'll show you

00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,010
guys that i think are pretty cool and

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,870
none of these are very well documented

00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,970
anywhere a lot of this you just learned

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:20,160
from reading other people's code reading

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,599
good maintainer code so i know these

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,940
aren't design patterns I've had people

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,829
other times given me these giving these

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,169
presentations that are very upset that I

00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,359
call these design patterns so just as a

00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:35,819
disclaimer this is not like computer

00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:37,139
science strict design patterns alright

00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,419
so first we're going to take a look at

00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:41,699
is creating your own hooks so everyone

00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:45,599
knows what a Drupal hook is right anyone

00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:47,569
okay good so the way I look at it

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,609
there's four different types of hooks

00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:52,019
this is sort of by my definition not

00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:54,329
really necessarily anything that's out

00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,299
there there's action hooks aggregate

00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,000
hooks alter hooks and attribute hooks so

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,650
we'll look at each one of these so how

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,449
do you use them there's also several

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,599
methods of actually invoking hooks

00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:09,150
there's just the simple way which most

00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:12,209
people never need there's aggregating

00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:15,229
results which is calling all hooks and

00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:17,669
getting all that data back in one form

00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:20,880
altering data so you can actually take

00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:23,159
an object pass it through and make any

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,670
changes you want as you go and also

00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:27,500
passing by reference which is

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,010
slightly different than altering data

00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,990
now explain why so simple and voguing

00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:36,260
probably everyone's seen an example like

00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,810
this that's all it takes you can create

00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:40,250
your own hook using that method you can

00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,500
call it whatever you want this is all

00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:46,310
Drupal needs there's no sort of way to

00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,890
define hooks they just exist so this is

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:59,750
the simplest way to call hooks for any

00:04:48,890 --> 00:05:01,400
module yeah exactly so there's no

00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:03,680
there's no sort of setup you have to do

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,110
for hooks they just there there it's

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,120
just all Drupal does match module name

00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,970
underscore hook name and that's all it

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,440
does so there's nothing really there's

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:14,360
nothing really strict about it you can

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:16,990
call hooks whatever you want use them

00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:20,060
how you need them aggregating results

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:21,650
this is an example where maybe you want

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:24,410
to collect everything this is something

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:26,300
like what views does the views default

00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:28,250
views hook where it'll loop through all

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:30,440
the modules and just make one big array

00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,330
of everything that's available and this

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,180
is a great way to extend your modules i

00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:37,310
know the flag module does this there's a

00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:39,920
lot of modules that take this approach

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,380
and this is just sort of the simplest

00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,260
version of that so module implements

00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:50,360
actually scans the functions and finds

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:52,610
which modules actually have that hook so

00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,530
altering data this is one I don't know

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,530
if I've ever seen custom code have this

00:05:54,530 --> 00:06:02,090
this is all you need to do to pass an

00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:04,460
object through hooks so it will call

00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:06,890
hook my data in every module with that

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:08,780
one object and it'll just get changed

00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:10,670
each one you don't have to do any

00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:15,530
looping or anything droop walters all

00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:17,870
you need this is this is a good one that

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:22,270
again i don't see people use but it's

00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:22,270
it's extremely extremely effective

00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:41,620
yeah menu all those by references a

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:43,450
little bit different because it can pass

00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:46,120
multiple things by reference this is

00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,590
what user module and boat does this is

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,080
probably the only place that follows

00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:52,540
this pattern but just so you know it's

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,340
there basically so you can pass multiple

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,530
arguments where drupal alter kind of

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,560
falls short mentally this is definitely

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:05,680
an edge case but it's out there so it's

00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:07,360
good to know about so this is definitely

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,830
jam packed with information so if you

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,750
have questions definitely feel free to

00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,700
just blurt them out it's going to be

00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:14,680
more efficient I'm sure you'll get more

00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,930
out of it that way I'm also looking at

00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,620
static variables little cute little

00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:21,700
hamster static electricity of course so

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:23,770
does everyone know what a static

00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,900
variable is in PHP or any programming

00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:32,350
language everyone have a basic idea it's

00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,380
just a PHP feature in google six

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:41,320
straight radiation through seven is low

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:43,810
low wrinkles that this is for speeding

00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:46,030
things up a big inning request so if you

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:47,890
have a function that's called a thousand

00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,250
times reflects on every time for class

00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:54,460
you should be shattered this is the

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:56,440
speed up accomplishing all of us some of

00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,130
you might go to them for instance these

00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,130
standards

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:07,430
so here's a simple example this is the

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,009
simple just keep you a good so we have

00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:12,740
SAT occur if it is that or if it's not

00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:20,960
set yes in step value for and you try

00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:23,780
p.m. simplest example 1 this is this is

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,789
any updated miss clairee in here if you

00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,919
got what service calls did anything like

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:30,289
that it's going to skip all of that and

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:33,440
how often this post a to change with

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:37,070
improvised it's not so static variables

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,640
affairs so triple seven makes it a

00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,789
little more tea it's now tuple static

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,510
function what this does the next thing

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:49,940
creates a basically a hash all static

00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:54,589
variables in drupal and the reason this

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:57,020
is cool because of this you can actually

00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:59,810
reset the static variable of another

00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:02,899
potion for instance under should note

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,660
close our sort static variables when you

00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:07,760
say the note how do you play this editor

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,220
now the problem is your mistakes that

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,800
had all kinds of nasty solutions for

00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:15,520
well now all you have to do is call

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,329
triple static reset and reset that

00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:22,670
noticed a great so you get the benefits

00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:24,770
of the static variables to group

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,149
performance but at the same time it's

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,149
actually control outside

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,860
so drupal's cash this is one of the

00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:42,180
biggest things how it suggests a road

00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:44,830
human consciousness using that it's

00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,020
super easy years and the performance

00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,930
improvements to be really really severe

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,760
especially heinous with the cash that

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,980
you may be seen perhaps something like

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,620
that where United make a day of it

00:09:53,980 --> 00:10:02,170
tonight across this game you can have a

00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:06,790
crazy improvement so this is for

00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:08,920
duplicate work that's clean not so

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,320
instead of requests static variable

00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,930
should be use with its user specific if

00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,050
it's something that Jake is often the

00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:20,320
Drupal have to be used or things that

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:23,290
don't change the car powered calls like

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,870
Hughes does catch to where all those

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,400
where it generates all those views it

00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,170
looks at everything is available a

00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,710
casual side because it doesn't want to

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:36,010
do that Americans things like going out

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,560
web services unit evacuations generals

00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:43,930
your Lester but not specific to request

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,089
the catchments has created that this is

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,450
the big one hears complicated one thing

00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:51,880
that PHP optimize that LOL its go to

00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:54,790
function as a really big deal for

00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:58,170
instance it if you need to dog in a new

00:10:54,790 --> 00:11:00,630
token for web service here 24 hours or

00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:02,490
if you need to make

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,250
that some sort of web service is

00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:07,590
available or checking status and another

00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:11,760
website there's a great thing when you

00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:15,390
see these mattresses and these get even

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,090
more than this will su some point you

00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:20,670
have ten different web servers and be

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:24,630
helping all of those from reusing the

00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:26,670
cat and the biggest thing is cash is

00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:30,030
always right there babe the less price

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:32,460
you get Davis there so even if there's

00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,040
no sort of speed and groom enesco in

00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:38,190
building just moving off the database

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,030
can really help once you see signs with

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:50,130
puns about millions of hits just moving

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:57,180
a cash out of davis losing 20 or 30 or

00:11:50,130 --> 00:12:02,460
so the papers were crazy and also this

00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:05,850
you only so anything that you can lose

00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:10,520
everything no story to Hollywood here

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:10,520
the cash to be ready to go away

00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:35,810
so the past involves Chester all these

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:37,940
emotions so there's three ways uses so

00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:40,940
the cap term that means it'll stay in

00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:44,660
cash until you mail it or you

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:48,830
specifically as temporary go away mad

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:52,490
passionate and unit sconce enemies will

00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:56,210
stay at least until elections and it

00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:58,850
will go anything special so this would

00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:01,070
be an example something where if you

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,740
need you also next terms of X term

00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,650
service people topiary six hours 3 12

00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:08,930
hours every 24 hours you can send this

00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:13,670
to six hours now and that way to get

00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:21,950
wrapped we can write it will get up this

00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:26,950
kid much glue can't haul no that's only

00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:29,950
cleared in CX a sailor tests that

00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,950
specifically

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,980
so that's something definitely scary but

00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:40,800
that's something i think the variables

00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:43,760
table uses cache memory because you get

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:49,350
always triggered as ever change this way

00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:51,690
maybe I believe also but the ones where

00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:53,670
there's always be some trigger that

00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,430
needs to know where the cash is reset

00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,899
but this obviously that's commitment

00:13:55,430 --> 00:14:06,110
it's not go so here's a basic usage

00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:09,810
example you try and get it if you'll get

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:13,490
seven get you go so can you explain me

00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,490
why you should do that

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:44,160
so what if I a false first so this is a

00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:47,580
great way to eliminate that possible

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,010
type of view false illegals value meal

00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:53,550
here if you do now you see little falls

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:59,370
you're going to track them so this is a

00:14:53,550 --> 00:15:01,050
grateful grateful tip so bring our

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:05,100
guests including phrase down trouble

00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:09,050
says the big long scary cultivated all

00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:11,970
this says get the cash table schema

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,000
talstar and then i can create mountain

00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:18,360
called cash and this is kind of your ass

00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,790
is if you create our own table or send

00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,930
my best if you create your own table it

00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,430
won't be cleared all you have to tell if

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,470
so some of the hash things out there

00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:31,730
past Monday don't respond to catch their

00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:35,430
all because it works or venerable Larry

00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:36,579
no one time you really I don't raise a

00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:38,679
lot of mosca later

00:15:36,579 --> 00:15:41,110
this its Maura if you really need to

00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:44,079
organize it over to the very specific

00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:53,019
expiration or you have a lot of passion

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:57,459
trees you're going to be easy so storing

00:15:53,019 --> 00:16:00,699
up Justin Davis is hood this is a fun

00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:02,199
most this is this one else to get a lot

00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:05,049
of comments on because most people are

00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:09,279
all up in arms those objects in the day

00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:15,249
that's not normalize yeah there's a

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:17,439
right out of your circle to trooper I

00:16:15,249 --> 00:16:20,739
reckon so much because price seen this

00:16:17,439 --> 00:16:23,559
at some point basically this just takes

00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:26,529
all of your it takes an object and

00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:30,220
writes a call back home today it's the

00:16:26,529 --> 00:16:33,389
simplest way it's best purchase single

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:37,360
second search okay so loaded on deck

00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:40,600
modified some way say that very simple

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,259
that's all what's really fun and there's

00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:47,139
a new in Drupal 7 near database engine

00:16:44,259 --> 00:16:49,389
there's actually a textile so Drupal

00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:53,049
stakes your pricey my TV fetch object

00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:56,410
Evie fetch array now in Drupal 7 the

00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:57,999
default is everything comes back so just

00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:00,549
that's one of those consciously

00:16:57,999 --> 00:17:08,439
recording for Michaels is now all the

00:17:00,549 --> 00:17:10,779
sudden areas not just watch out so just

00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:14,230
to illustrate this I'm going to create a

00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:18,120
real simple table just to just so we

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:21,760
know all Newman is given IV valium I

00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:27,880
need cereal injure values just some

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,850
string just wake up in place so as an

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:34,059
example I'm going to create a date

00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:35,830
object with an ID or not you and what

00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,630
you're right right because this is not a

00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:39,990
pattern you see all over the place this

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,669
is what those do users to taxonomy

00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:46,120
anything that is an object that they are

00:17:42,669 --> 00:17:49,960
not very hardly instead of praying to

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:53,220
over teams it does it so basically if

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,520
you set I need to soon start exist and

00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:59,559
your hike record based don't get so you

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,480
can see this is on that good of an

00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:07,090
update and checking the vit exist if you

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,320
just comment on a bright record up

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,399
yesterday

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:15,820
do a good circle and then it sets so

00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:19,029
this is actually my reference so if you

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,889
have to know table using this is a super

00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:23,340
easy way to load some thinking whatever

00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:26,409
changes you want and please save it and

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:36,730
practically no total not even do a

00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:39,070
sequel or type actuator in Augusta so

00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,570
serializing is pretty cool serializing

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:47,559
is all of the nasty pattern ash able to

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:49,600
this part drupal doesn't matter so you

00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,139
don't have to worry about asking a lot

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,750
of people call XP realize materialize

00:18:52,139 --> 00:18:56,860
saving that loading yard unsere little

00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,289
bit lower you're doing all kinds of

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,929
other stuff you can actually find it

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:04,149
straight and scheming all you need to

00:19:01,929 --> 00:19:07,870
set the serial s property in that column

00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:10,419
to church so any time you called the

00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:14,379
database will come back as an actual

00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:17,919
project instead of a screen series so

00:19:14,379 --> 00:19:19,170
that's actually the scheme in comes a

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,300
lot of features

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:25,710
this is certainly one that kind of

00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:27,870
socially we're in that it may believe

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,850
this area less than serialize so there's

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:32,850
nothing really special going on there

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:37,920
it's fully optimized by tht guesstimates

00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:40,250
it follows a normal and this is best

00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:43,170
easily just have additional options

00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,660
obviously once internet object in the

00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:48,600
database and that for you can't search

00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:50,280
for it you can't you can't select it

00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,700
we're phones anything like that it's

00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,270
just for sort of variable logic so for

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:59,190
instance the user table mrs. if there's

00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,950
some matching you know the user you just

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:05,070
want to say you don't care if it needs

00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,020
to be in david is searching for many for

00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:10,980
your debt there's a column but they're

00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:13,810
just stores serialized objects options

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:17,440
for you sir there's some other niceties

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:24,070
that's the primaries for serializing

00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:26,440
parties and also passionate and this

00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:29,140
really surprises me is how all of this

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,200
may not be wrong there's also something

00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:35,550
we said or not having 40 pounds of the

00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:39,150
table work for me 100 remaining for us

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:39,150
that's the trade-off

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,320
so I can stand on the schema both it's

00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:51,990
all doing is adding options options

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:54,870
helium and you see I have a serialized

00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:56,820
property sector that's all I need to do

00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,100
now I have something that will

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:03,930
dynamically stay awesome sterilized what

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:06,990
I rest later so here the same pattern

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:10,910
porch but all movies now is an option

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:14,280
here which is an array and this is

00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:17,340
important that's all that's all the work

00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:20,330
you have to do to put an array of class

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:24,930
any sort of advanced age 40 divisions

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:27,210
and do right I pretty little effort it

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:29,880
looks at skiing it got here some thai

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,860
difficult to state any time you eat

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:40,530
before i wreck it will save you a lot of

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:44,370
work so mean so most people in the

00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:47,220
system that has that work some something

00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:50,250
in everything they didn't alter and will

00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:53,540
show up but if people just no kidding

00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,540
this is that you have to catch

00:21:53,870 --> 00:22:01,710
that's obviously so one of the cool

00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,259
things is page arguments this is

00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:09,029
something I see fairly often this is all

00:22:04,259 --> 00:22:10,590
she reviews callbacks and it basically

00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:14,159
just creates an array out of the

00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:17,429
different URL parts so wrinkles give you

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:23,759
see like no good idea that's known as

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:27,720
zero that I get one edge and this is

00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:34,649
what i really hope mel appeases duties

00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:37,830
are so what happens when you want to

00:22:34,649 --> 00:22:40,190
change Europe get change the orbit every

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,190
place

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:51,450
so there's also possible so by default

00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:55,160
most people memories how to call backs

00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:57,300
because it just use the team finalist

00:22:55,160 --> 00:23:00,210
but there's a lot of cool things you can

00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:03,330
do with with create dynamic titles so

00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:05,850
think about like a note page write that

00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:07,820
note in your honor it doesn't kind of it

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:10,590
because it's different for every school

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:12,930
so it has a title callback that actually

00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:15,330
takes a developed it does some logic

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,860
configured all the title should be so if

00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:19,770
you have any sort of age with any other

00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:23,370
titles title callbacks a really really

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:26,160
simple way of commerce stuff and this is

00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:30,450
another one this game kind of us this

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:32,490
drivel SAT idle mainly because it's just

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,990
a body's kind of hard to track down for

00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:39,870
the area logics into the theme somewhere

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:42,770
it hasn't used but you just try to avoid

00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,770
as much possible

00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:59,890
so this is so this is one is I don't

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,980
think it's actually documented in the

00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:06,700
made guys not actually explicitly right

00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,350
now but it is if you will get it if you

00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,780
have a little too maybe tape or go to

00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:14,440
the dodo for user muffled you see

00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:23,680
something that says like no % code edit

00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:26,380
type that % know what this does is it

00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:28,330
passes out it passes that argument in

00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:34,240
the URL to another function

00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:38,140
automatically and it automatically adds

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,730
load to target in so if someone can

00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:44,920
point me to where that's documented I

00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:49,540
would be really bad as probably fifty

00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:53,560
six months period of us there's like a

00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,890
paragraph 3 momentum in exercise it

00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,890
depends

00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:09,850
so what happens is if you have the %

00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:13,600
note asking all the episodes on user all

00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:17,559
these are life which i think is so odd

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:21,610
because in your basic calling one of the

00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:26,110
weird where percent understood looking

00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:29,409
something the number one it helps remove

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:31,450
redundant so if you've written art if

00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:34,029
you've written urls we have arguments in

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:36,580
the URL a lot of times we'll see people

00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:40,600
pull out the argument come make some

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:44,740
database call and get an object load

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:46,899
function to do all that on and it allows

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,000
you to send objects to the edge column

00:25:46,899 --> 00:25:51,460
so instead of patient I like doing work

00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:57,269
itself it can just as soon as mal'chik

00:25:51,460 --> 00:26:00,250
there waiting for so here's an example

00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:02,230
so i have my module day here at the

00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:06,309
locomotion which gives me my logical

00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:08,889
data load so my day is going to be

00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:13,240
whatever is in the URL so let's say it's

00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:14,589
data point so this arguably data one is

00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,989
going to be some

00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:20,539
object in that accident passed brutal

00:26:17,989 --> 00:26:23,330
mini system so he is down to the cage

00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:26,299
call back it's already about you don't

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:28,279
have to do that work every time so for

00:26:26,299 --> 00:26:31,580
instance if you bring some module that

00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:33,619
needs to do a good load all you do is a

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:35,539
crescendo in the URL it will

00:26:33,619 --> 00:26:37,759
automatically turn negative note object

00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:41,539
for you same with these are staying with

00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:44,599
me of the times so this can take a lot

00:26:41,539 --> 00:26:47,719
of work maybe the punishment OH think

00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:49,629
maybe I added that resisted but it's is

00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:55,759
that my kid in there I don't understand

00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:58,609
just recently reading yes it has sort of

00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,879
a specific use case but using anything

00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:04,940
extra code data objects or you want to

00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:06,409
use though to users in your URL this is

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:16,279
a great shortcut so you don't have to

00:27:06,409 --> 00:27:18,799
call the novo to mutilate yourself so

00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:20,929
I'm sure about this a lot of information

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,549
actually all this online there's

00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:24,850
actually a bigger explanations for every

00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:28,840
topic that

00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:30,870
presentation so not nice like everything

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,080
out rather put all the information here

00:27:30,870 --> 00:27:39,580
just be large right on so don't be

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:43,030
pissed so this is putting all the

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:47,170
government's know there are this is part

00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:49,330
of it so what I'm actually doing here is

00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:55,210
this an example how to write your own

00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:57,060
explorable sport so this is we have

00:27:55,210 --> 00:28:00,250
climb on which is to the sarah thing

00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:02,620
yeah my module it may take a key which

00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:07,870
was one thing you notice a callback

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:10,300
system I have a few here which this is

00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:13,210
basically just saying it varies in his

00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:16,690
life there's nothing after 108 adjust

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:19,960
fault here for us things that but

00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:22,030
outside next so my module some Jeannie

00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,920
export and that's a completely different

00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:26,320
call that but they're all going to be

00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:29,970
using the exact simple functions so i

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,970
can write this three lines of code once

00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:40,450
so I need static Holmes's here to get

00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:42,790
all of my data searches so if there is

00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,100
my logical data if that's part if we've

00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:49,180
already called that it will return me if

00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:52,170
not what it does is a stable so this is

00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:52,170
this triple step

00:28:52,370 --> 00:29:01,200
so I just like everything to my table

00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:05,220
and just just from one table to that

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:09,510
whole structure and then I'm going to do

00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:13,309
the aggregate hook x bigger and your

00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:15,900
modular mode on this hook with that and

00:29:13,309 --> 00:29:20,309
get it for everything awesome put all

00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:22,200
together so the magic that PSA with use

00:29:20,309 --> 00:29:25,230
or something where if you make a nice

00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:29,400
change and that sticks that a variety

00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:34,020
else encode this is all fused us so what

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:38,460
this is saying is merge he was in code

00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:40,679
into what's in vegas so this code is

00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,590
essentially what cheese does obviously

00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:52,080
hallmark standard but this will work

00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:59,929
exactly so couple more horses so we have

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:59,929
the load this is seven drupal 7

00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,860
okay so I have a lot of functions that

00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:25,440
in Drupal 7 the routine is you load

00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:28,470
everything and you pull out individual

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,440
or a condition this way everything is

00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:33,720
loaded at the very beginning and then if

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,000
you ever be p stomach is already there

00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:41,040
instead of a pea pod a baseball to use

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,660
do it once I'll some title column which

00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:47,540
is basically going to take in that

00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:51,750
object and just switch in the page title

00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:59,190
with the value of that key with a value

00:30:51,750 --> 00:31:03,810
of that work and the view I had a few

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:06,330
callback which takes you saw briefly

00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,120
where if there's no arguments light or

00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:12,420
anything it wasn't arguments but one

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:16,320
thing so all doing here is I love you

00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:20,190
which if if there is no argument I think

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,450
one thing if it sir sorry there is Marty

00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,730
nothing one thing if there is no

00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,019
argument I just looped through all

00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:32,750
things are available

00:31:26,019 --> 00:31:36,649
another 23 and export all these dozen

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:39,830
calls are exporting HP there's no weird

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:41,570
like to fitting thing is filling out to

00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:45,500
flip this big array structures in the

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:48,799
text field all it is barks worth PHP on

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:58,809
PHP function and all yours explore

00:31:48,799 --> 00:32:02,090
talents say so that's this sort of

00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:03,799
baseline of what kind of tricks or can

00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:06,260
be thought a not very well documented

00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,299
there's so many other examples like

00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:14,480
locking mechanisms which is new to the

00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:16,490
Drupal 7 and it came out Drupal 6 15 it

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,600
was actually chose add at the last

00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:24,220
minute interval six right Street altis

00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,740
is a new one using queuing matching

00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,450
Drupal 6 half bathroom but these are all

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,429
things are just keep in da bag let's

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:34,669
just a new stuff you can always find

00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:36,500
that their documents somewhere but it's

00:32:34,669 --> 00:32:42,049
almost like this issue unless you know

00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:46,000
what it is it's not really good so I

00:32:42,049 --> 00:32:46,000
think learn where all these tricks from

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:53,510
the best way is actually to want to let

00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,490
either reading core issues that are

00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:57,670
happening so this is the best way to

00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:00,730
figure out why some things actually

00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:03,700
reply something as argument doesn't or

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,910
what static the reason the issues of the

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:10,590
best place to get the water the 89 best

00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,590
place to get out so there's definitely

00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,250
another thing that's really more mental

00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:21,640
issue is a huge herbaliser Kramer it is

00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:25,480
a CMS and that's best Aguirre other but

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:27,580
it's also Frank is something that you if

00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,490
you know the right motion also you can

00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,980
speed up your your develop you don't

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,020
have to what we think about is your

00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,910
fighting against the CMS just think

00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:40,020
about the friendship is enough there so

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:42,400
you get happy about working with a CMS

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:44,670
and the key thing is you want to spend

00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,770
time on flexibility not complexity

00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:50,290
there's a lot of stuff in Drupal that

00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:52,630
can automate the work to work with it

00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:57,270
for instance of the two boys community

00:33:52,630 --> 00:34:01,420
request watch that can replace using her

00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:04,200
car loans options all messed up there's

00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:09,429
a lot of 78-yard simplify your life

00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:14,610
without worrying about without worrying

00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:18,669
about rewrite with our DM PhD summer and

00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:20,020
those excuse your hooks so this I don't

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,320
know if you guys have seen the arduous

00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:25,379
but I think we're going to face one of

00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,779
the ones that is kind of pushing

00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:30,869
but if we have an ain't got much easier

00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:35,960
in India there's a lot of functions like

00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:35,960
taxonomy where it's just some sort

00:34:36,799 --> 00:34:42,899
there's just some sort of internal

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:47,339
functioning call you should be easier on

00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:50,069
box werry if you know you're going to

00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:52,799
kno your know other people and expand on

00:34:50,069 --> 00:34:55,470
and that's the point it really put a

00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:58,079
project out there it s people work on it

00:34:55,470 --> 00:35:01,009
they can add right I don't think these

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:07,200
would have the ecosystem at us now if

00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:11,279
everything could get over it so this is

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,769
D you ever have all five of those tips I

00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:18,059
guess I have fully expanded with those

00:35:13,769 --> 00:35:20,849
codes if it's long multi paragraph

00:35:18,059 --> 00:35:23,849
explanations of us going on to go to

00:35:20,849 --> 00:35:27,799
this page it's actually broken down into

00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:27,799
links to the other five topics

00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:54,819
so this is kind of in a single place to

00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:57,700
operate a contacting right website but

00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:59,650
this is is a lot longer explanations the

00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,410
game I said it's a lot of information

00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:23,349
but I ready you guys as much you can now

00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:26,190
get apply it that's what we have seen

00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:29,430
all your Twitter or just get website

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:32,200
send me questions however you want but I

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:34,509
think this is this presentation of

00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,470
exigent I did you can't afford it and

00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:41,019
also hit me up in LA I think this is one

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:45,009
that has had the mid side in multiple

00:36:41,019 --> 00:36:47,519
places and all that keep doing it if

00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:47,519
there's any other

00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,640
the way to sort of passed on knowledge

00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:54,920
other developers exhaust or real things

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,250
are found so if you have any suggestions

00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,710
you have any particular things that took

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,470
took you a long time adventure what do

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:05,930
you think this guy yesterday definitely

00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:09,109
passionate love to include those tight

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:12,770
examples I give these presentations I

00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:16,849
have one dream Kirsten I look at

00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:19,609
traveling almost entirely from ideology

00:37:16,849 --> 00:37:21,950
different clients I guess the allotments

00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:24,160
takes a lot of cool things and the

00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:28,609
market here for more help the better

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:34,210
presentation so many questions on this

00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:34,210
are again another example of things

00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:53,980
the last thing that goes for the way

00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:13,910
forward one yeah what we found you the

00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:18,619
same yes that is very last one if your

00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:21,710
menu has something as like a second

00:38:18,619 --> 00:38:24,770
argument something of your situation

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:32,270
with views will complain in this example

00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:34,520
while passed recently came across use

00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:35,220
just basically saying like you can't

00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:39,790

00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:58,290

00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,290
