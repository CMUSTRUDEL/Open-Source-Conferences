the following presentation was recorded

00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:08,040

00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,320
the southeast linux fest would like to

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,279
thank the following diamond sponsors in

00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,970
2012 for helping make these videos

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:31,560
possible dozen really matter with you

00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:34,440
official title it's hi thanks for coming

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,730
on Saturday maybe some of you had better

00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,180
things to do so I appreciate your being

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:43,770
here so it's a it's a smallish room and

00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:45,149
I'm a fan of sort of informal

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:47,700
presentations which is why don't have a

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,559
deck I tend not to believe in them

00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:54,870
especially in a small room and I also

00:00:51,559 --> 00:00:58,199
don't really like talking to people who

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,520
sort of you know I don't understand what

00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,750
they're here for and in a room this

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,880
small I think it's okay for me to ask

00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,500
questions of you justice is okay of you

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,020
to ask questions of me and I've got a

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,119
sort of presentation in my head that all

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,670
I'll give bits and pieces of its if it's

00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,229
appropriate and if no one has any

00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,450
pressing questions I can always just

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,030
wander through but to me it's sort of

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:22,560
much more interesting to hear about what

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,040
you're doing with cloud if anything

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,030
because it seems to me let they go right

00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,860
zero right and one of the things that I

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,140
don't like doing is coming up and say

00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,840
the futures club blah blah blah when no

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,549
one is necessarily do anything doing

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,100
anything about it or don't know why they

00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:44,630
should and sort of don't know where to

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,649
get started and there's really no

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:51,030
one-size-fits-all deck for that so let

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,850
me start with some questions and maybe a

00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,310
show of hands if that's okay how many of

00:01:53,850 --> 00:02:00,500
you use Linux here at southeast linux

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:02,579
fest good good start how many of you are

00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,240
assisted mins who are responsible for

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:08,129
some number of production systems okay a

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,840
significant number so that that's good

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:13,110
that means I'll have some important

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,980
things to say to you how many are doing

00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:17,069
any of that stuff

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,349
on the public cloud ie amazon or

00:02:17,069 --> 00:02:23,940
somewhere else at this point a much

00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:25,530
smaller number interesting blend and you

00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,459
know what we see right that's that's

00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,560
what we see people whose job it is to

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:34,260
manage and administer enterprise systems

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:36,840
are sort of caught in this thing I like

00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,410
to call the SIS admin's lament right so

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:45,120
let me share with you the SIS admin's

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:47,340
lament as I see it being assisted men is

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,470
a hard job because you have to deal with

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,299
users all day every day and they have

00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:53,760
requests and some of them are reasonable

00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:55,319
and many of them are unreasonable and

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,950
you have to fulfill them all just the

00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:00,810
same and so in order to do that IT

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:04,290
departments have come up over the years

00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:06,359
with lots of interesting hurdles not

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:09,120
necessarily to prevent people from

00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:11,700
getting the services they need but to

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,319
make sure that I t is properly protected

00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,910
from all of the people who come in and

00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,859
ask for a production server two days

00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:21,389
before they need it ready right but of

00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:23,370
course they still do they always will

00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:24,919
right that's the nature of users they

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,540
want what they want when they want it

00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,910
and they don't think about things like

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,560
you know is there a server in the back

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,709
room that can accommodate this and what

00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,209
happens when you know the load goes to

00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,980
20 at three in the morning it's not

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,560
users job to think about that it's a sis

00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,500
intense job to think about that right so

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,040
in the enterprise there are all kinds of

00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:52,769
change request mechanisms and you know

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:55,290
requisition forms and even the most

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:56,910
effective organizations are now finding

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:59,190
themselves in the position where there's

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:01,459
a developer who has a perfectly

00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:04,620
reasonable request to get a box set up

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:05,910
now for some skunk works project that

00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,799
they're working on that they think can

00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:11,609
change the company and do something

00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,220
incredibly cool and rather than go

00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:18,840
through what may be a month long process

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:21,900
to get some VMO or dedicated system or

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,730
something set aside for them they are

00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:29,220
willing now to do this

00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,950
all right take out a credit card and go

00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:34,740
set that system up on Amazon or

00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:39,030
someplace else but mostly amazon right

00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,440
now in 15 minutes right and if you know

00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:43,850
what you're doing it's more like two

00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:46,830
minutes to set up your own amazon

00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,780
instance right and they come and they're

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:50,640
at they go all the way down to a micro

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,980
instance that's free for the first year

00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,210
so now a lot of people don't even have

00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,490
to pull out the credit card for that

00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:58,800
first am I they just they just set it up

00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,830
for free all the way up to great big

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,960
things that you know have essentially

00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:09,690
dedicated machines and it's this

00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:14,220
self-service nature of the way amazon

00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:15,660
works that is you know scaring the hell

00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,020
out of a lot of dissidents right now and

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,120
for good reason right traditional IT

00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,710
organizations tend to think in terms of

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,180
command and control of those resources

00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:33,180
and the cloud model really really makes

00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:37,110
that challenging right so we call this

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:40,380
the public cloud i work for a company

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,350
called eucalyptus what we do is private

00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,880
cloud and i don't want this to be too

00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,830
much of a product pitch but to a certain

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,810
degree i can't help it so if that

00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,840
offends you I don't mind if you leave

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:53,400
for the door I you know David if you get

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,840
tired of David is one of my competitors

00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,669
the CloudStack you talked this morning

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,870
so if you get tired of hearing me just

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:02,190
feel free to or throw things at you know

00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,240
we're both open source though when we're

00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:05,250
going to you know we're going to share

00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,930
some code maybe we need to talk to you

00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:12,060
about are you are you I we got problems

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,650
by the way we'll talk about that because

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,510
we don't care about the UI so much we

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,070
care about the API so all of our efforts

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,060
go into the API and then everyone says

00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:25,530
crouched Eric's really pretty so

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:28,110
competition open source yay yes co-op

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,240
attention that's right so so we're now

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,770
in a place where a bunch of enterprises

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,330
and this is most of the people who come

00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,400
to us a lot of the people come to us

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,370
with assistant mins lament they say

00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,790
either there and mostly it's the head of

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,110
the eye

00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:43,050
department they're coming to us and

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:45,210
saying we would really like some way of

00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,220
taking all of these workloads that have

00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,960
gone rogue out in the cloud and pulled

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,580
those back in could you help us with

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,250
that please so that's what we do my

00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:56,160
company eucalyptus systems what's not my

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,900
company it's our company and the CEO is

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,380
Martin Miko's who is the former CEO of

00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:04,880
my sequel our company provides private

00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,650
open-source infrastructure-as-a-service

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,200
software so that you can set up your own

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:13,020
cloud and the intent is to make it look

00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,850
just like Amazon as much like Amazon as

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,300
possible at least on the back end right

00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:22,640
all of the api's and so forth so I'll

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:25,140
talk a little bit about that and sort of

00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:26,910
what private cloud means and what hybrid

00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,740
cloud me it's right that's direction I'm

00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:30,240
going here also there's any questions at

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,300
any point feel free or if you disagree

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,660
or anything at all just feel free to

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,660
holler like I really welcome at that

00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,380
it's a funny thing everyone in the

00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:51,560
enterprise world is now very interested

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:53,150
in cloud mostly vendors right vendors

00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:55,610
are really interested in talking about

00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:57,050
cloud cloud cloud cloud they can cloud

00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,180
your cloud and they can put some cloud

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:00,889
on top of your cloud or they can take

00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,260
their virtualization virtualization

00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:04,790
virtualization to make a cloud or they

00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,590
can take their systems management tool

00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:10,310
and clarify your management of systems

00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:12,080
in the cloud right which you know that's

00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,360
there's good reasons for that right

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,620
amazon is growing explosively and

00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,389
they're pretty much proving the

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,220
viability of that model and it's not

00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:21,350
like they're slowing down so companies

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,630
have good reason to do that but a lot of

00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,950
companies especially some large

00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,479
enterprise companies in the

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,860
virtualization space that I don't

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:33,500
necessarily have to name they sort of

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,360
they want if they want you to fear the

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,400
public cloud they want you to fear the

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,469
public cloud because the public cloud is

00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:44,480
scary right they have your data you have

00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,250
no idea where that data might be you

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,529
have no idea who might have access to

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,750
that data it's in the public cloud god

00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,339
only knows where it is well I mean the

00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,870
same thing is true at any large data

00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,750
center but that doesn't stop them from

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,220
using data centers right and the fact is

00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,279
that the people who are handling

00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:03,589
security at amazon or other large cloud

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,510
vendors probably have more and better

00:09:03,589 --> 00:09:07,310
security folks paying attention to the

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:11,089
key questions than they do in their own

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:14,029
organizations right so I think one of

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:17,870
the thing that distinguishes eucalyptus

00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:20,839
as a company is that we sort of rely

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:23,690
upon you to use the public cloud right

00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,959
because our entire value proposition is

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:29,930
that you should use Amazon for as much

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,400
as you can and we know perfectly well

00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:34,850
that they're going to be times when

00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,040
Amazon just isn't right for you and it's

00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,470
not because the cloud is scary it's

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,930
because there are legitimate uses for

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,490
the public cloud and the private cloud

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,080
there are some things you don't want out

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:47,540
there there are a lot of things you do

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,160
and the key is to make sure that when

00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,130
you're managing all of these systems in

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,630
these two places the tools and the

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,839
systems and the process is that you're

00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,350
using on both sides are as much alike as

00:09:56,839 --> 00:09:59,690
they can

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,270
possibly be and the workload of managing

00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,820
both of those sets of systems is as low

00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:06,050
as it can possibly be okay you're

00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:12,340
starting to hear people talk about

00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:14,540
hybrid cloud that's what they mean right

00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,990
does that make sense of people heard the

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,700
term hybrid cloud so maybe not maybe

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:21,770
this is something that's happening in in

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,720
vendor land primarily but right but we

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,340
can assure you us vendors we can assure

00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,580
you this is the direction that things

00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:33,340
are going right so so I saw a couple of

00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,630
hands go up for people who are using

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:39,740
Amazon for actual something who were

00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:41,720
those people again right so if so for

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,200
what shout it out what do you use you

00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,690
wouldn't use it for what workloads

00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:55,940
uh-huh is there anything except lamps

00:10:47,690 --> 00:11:01,940
tax by the way so does rails count as a

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:04,520
lamp stack it's a ramp stack and it

00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:07,460
comes from Japan so well that's terrible

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:09,410
Ruby Japan that's oh wow I'm ashamed

00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:13,070
that my brain even went there but yes

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,990
the ramp sack um so yes and that's

00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,900
exactly right and everyone is running a

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:19,640
lamb stack how many people saw the azure

00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:22,550
announcement yesterday or maybe it was

00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:25,420
Thursday Asher yeah what is as you're

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:28,850
doing tell us adding the Linux support

00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:31,790
right mostly adding lamp stack supports

00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,170
of various kinds so and this is the

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,910
funny thing it you know and it's sort of

00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:37,220
it's sort of weird coming to an open

00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:40,790
source convention conference at any kind

00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,860
of these days you know and and you know

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:44,660
and frankly the numbers are smaller than

00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:46,310
they used to be and I think one of the

00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,490
reasons the numbers are smaller is that

00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:51,530
open stores basically kind of one right

00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,650
the kind of fun badly days are sort of

00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:59,090
open / right open source and Linux are

00:11:54,650 --> 00:12:01,700
so commonplace now that in order to

00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,910
compete in the cloud world in the public

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:07,730
cloud world Microsoft Azure has no

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,230
choice but to make linux tax available

00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:11,059
because that's what customers are paying

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,459
for and Microsoft being in the business

00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:14,929
to make money says all right we will

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:16,999
make lamps tax available and we'll

00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:19,219
figure out how to make money on it right

00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:21,349
I mean that's a you know I was doing

00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:23,269
these conferences 10 years ago I don't

00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:25,699
think you know we may have talked about

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:28,339
that but I don't really think we ever

00:12:25,699 --> 00:12:32,619
imagined that that this is where we'd

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:34,669
end up right all right so enough of that

00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:36,939
virtualization how many people are using

00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:40,279
virtualization in your environments and

00:12:36,939 --> 00:12:42,019
of the sets almost all of you and almost

00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:46,699
a complete overlap with the with the

00:12:42,019 --> 00:12:48,169
with the folks who are assisted mins is

00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:50,899
there anyone whose assisted min for

00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:54,099
serious numbers of boxes that doesn't

00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:56,749
use virtualization in your environment

00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:58,279
no right so one hundred percent overlap

00:12:56,749 --> 00:13:00,619
between real sis admin's and people

00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:04,369
using virtualization how many of you are

00:13:00,619 --> 00:13:07,759
using open-source virtualization and how

00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:09,499
many of you are using VMware ok so

00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,909
that's a pretty even split and also

00:13:09,499 --> 00:13:16,489
pretty representative so one of the

00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:18,949
value propositions of eucalyptus and I

00:13:16,489 --> 00:13:23,119
believe other cloud platforms to be to

00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:24,949
be clear as well is the ability to put a

00:13:23,119 --> 00:13:26,989
management layer a self-service

00:13:24,949 --> 00:13:30,229
management layer on top of all of that

00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:32,029
virtualization stuff right so how many

00:13:30,229 --> 00:13:38,319
people who are using VMware using vCloud

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:40,819
director you're about to you wish talk

00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:42,529
you should reconsider that it's just my

00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:43,939
I'm you know I mean if there any VMware

00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,189
sales people in the audience I'm sorry

00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:49,549
but we should you should consider that

00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:51,049
right because they say they're in the

00:13:49,549 --> 00:13:52,369
cloud business but they're not there in

00:13:51,049 --> 00:13:54,199
the virtualization business and they're

00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:56,359
different right and one of the key

00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:58,609
differences is that in a cloud

00:13:56,359 --> 00:14:00,499
environment you have heterogeneous

00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:02,989
environments to deal with right is

00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:06,169
vmware the only virtualization stack

00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:09,049
Iran are you happy with that for now

00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:12,049
exactly for now right and I think that

00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:13,249
as vmware sort of you know sees more

00:14:12,049 --> 00:14:14,659
competition they're going to be

00:14:13,249 --> 00:14:16,419
tightening those screws to do what they

00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:20,929
can to make sure that people are single

00:14:16,419 --> 00:14:24,060
vendor shops right and so when we go to

00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:25,980
customers one of the things we pitch is

00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,570
you don't want to care what kind of

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,550
virtualization stack you're running

00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:31,200
under underneath right if you can't if

00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,940
you don't have some combination of

00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,530
libraries like libvirt to manage

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,410
everything on the open source site like

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,060
the Zen and kb m and so forth and

00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:41,850
whatever tools vmware has to expose

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,650
their API once you have these api tools

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,220
what you really want is a layer on top

00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:49,440
of that that can manage all of that

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,500
excuse me in in the same kind of

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,750
self-service way that the cloud allows

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,950
you to to manage that stuff with because

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,630
that's going to be one of your

00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:00,420
requirements isset mins if it's not

00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:03,030
today it will be right maybe not today

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:05,280
maybe not tomorrow maybe your bulwarks

00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:07,950
of process are going to hold the hordes

00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,510
at bay for a while but at some point the

00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:12,170
majority of people in this space are

00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,730
going to come to expect self-service

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:17,070
virtualized machines on demand

00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:18,330
everywhere because they because the

00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:20,580
smart ones know that they can already

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,710
get that now just by avoiding you all

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:26,040
right and putting paying a few bucks out

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:29,490
of their own pocket so when we talked to

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:31,230
VMware folks you know we are sure to

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:36,510
mention that there's difference between

00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:42,120
virtualization and cloud right and so

00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:43,710
yes we should we should talk any

00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:49,760
questions at all because if not I'm just

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:49,760
going to start telling stories yes

00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,860
the

00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,820
six six or seven providers that you can

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,560
move publishing different providers they

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,930
even bring them back into your

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,930
environment and vice versa and the API

00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:24,840
which providers with us we're any of

00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,700
them amazon right so and this is

00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,580
interesting right and this is and so you

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,640
can see here where the cloud wars are

00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,160
going right because it's all about the

00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:37,080
API and the thing that you said in there

00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,390
that stood out is that what their

00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,090
pitching is one hundred percent API

00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:45,210
comparative compatibility with in this

00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:47,220
family of offerings right and that

00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:52,530
family of offerings is essentially

00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:54,030
defined by API fidelity right so that's

00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:58,290
one of the reasons that when eucalyptus

00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:59,820
was founded well I so okay this isn't

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:01,920
fair this is this is looking back

00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:03,720
historically but it was a really good

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,430
guess at the time right because really

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,199
there was only one public cloud

00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,449
essentially and it was amazon that

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,030
exposed any management API is in public

00:17:09,449 --> 00:17:15,810
when eucalyptus started as a project at

00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,850
UCSB in 2007 and so that was it and they

00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:19,949
said that's what a public cloud looks

00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,449
like so we'll just take that API did

00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:22,829
they imagine that the world would come

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,839
when there were lots of competing

00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:27,110
projects with different API is probably

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:29,820
not they saw one that they went with it

00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,220
but in that time there have been many

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,950
other projects that are trying to set up

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:39,300
competitive api's so that they can use

00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:41,280
that API as as a key part of the value

00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:45,660
proposition right and that moving of

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:48,060
workloads back and forth we like to

00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,370
claim at eucalyptus that we are the best

00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:53,730
at moving workloads back and forth

00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,260
between us and Amazon and we

00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:57,390
deliberately don't focus on those other

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,400
players because we feel like Amazon is

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,410
the strongest we feel like amazon has

00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,520
the biggest lead and we feel like they

00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:04,740
are going to continue to have the

00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,290
biggest lead and we're going to keep up

00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:09,120
with them as best as we can by running

00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,119
full speed and still not being even

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,139
close

00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:19,029
right earlier this year we signed a deal

00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:20,859
with Amazon around those api's and

00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:23,139
basically an agreement that we would

00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:25,359
work together to make sure that our API

00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:28,659
fidelity was as close as possible to

00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,799
Amazon which is a big deal for us and

00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,589
the reason that was a big deal is

00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,199
because it was amazon implicitly

00:18:32,589 --> 00:18:36,399
admitting that on-premise cloud they

00:18:35,199 --> 00:18:38,499
don't like to call a private cloud they

00:18:36,399 --> 00:18:41,019
call it on premise cloud they admitted

00:18:38,499 --> 00:18:43,329
that on-premise cloud was a thing right

00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:45,639
for the longest time amazon wouldn't

00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:47,739
really even admit that on-premise cloud

00:18:45,639 --> 00:18:49,389
was a thing now they agree that it's a

00:18:47,739 --> 00:18:51,339
thing and it's a thing you should pay

00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:53,109
attention to and it's a thing that you

00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:55,959
should probably seek to make sure is

00:18:53,109 --> 00:18:59,309
compatible with the cloud that they want

00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:59,309
you to use which is the Amazon Cloud

00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:04,929
what what so virtualization folks what

00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:07,829
do you use what tools do you use to

00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:10,709
manage your your machines like are you

00:19:07,829 --> 00:19:15,399
how are you managing your virtual

00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:17,679
machine stacks now puppet chef various

00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:23,349
tools anyone installing them one at a

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:32,079
time really nothing installing one at a

00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:33,789
time yeah interesting oh thanks for the

00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,849
mic say that again into the mic are you

00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:40,059
recording this by the way yeah currently

00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:42,219
we're doing things one at a time right

00:19:40,059 --> 00:19:44,139
and I have personally I have automation

00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:46,719
for my guests but not for the hosts

00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:50,499
right we're looking at one of our other

00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:53,469
RT groups to help post our VMs but they

00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:54,639
don't want to give us infrastructure as

00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:56,409
a service they want to give us plot from

00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:58,299
a service which we don't want aha

00:19:56,409 --> 00:20:00,279
because you want control it's an

00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:01,779
interesting split how many people are

00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,389
aware of the difference between the term

00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:06,939
infrastructure as a service and platform

00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:08,619
as a service okay so that's good that

00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:11,079
that's starting to filter up and that's

00:20:08,619 --> 00:20:12,879
a that's a that's a good point I think

00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:16,329
that platform as a service is going to

00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:18,489
be awesome in the longer term platform

00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:20,409
as a service does a really bad job of

00:20:18,489 --> 00:20:22,839
dealing with any legacy app at all

00:20:20,409 --> 00:20:23,900
because of course they don't exist in

00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:25,610
you know when you wrote

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:27,500
whatever thing would see the little

00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:29,360
hooks and Python thing over here in the

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,610
pearl library that you can't get rid of

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,830
and you know the java stuff that came

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:36,050
from a company acquisition that sits off

00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:38,120
to the side and you've got so calls to

00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:40,360
it and all that's not that's not that

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,880
yeah that's not a platform as a service

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:45,800
compatible offering but that's all you

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:48,380
got and that's almost enterprises have

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:51,140
got right so Paz is fantastic in the

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:52,910
startup world and everyone loves it

00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,780
right everyone's going Heroku an engine

00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,580
yard and whatever and cloudbees and all

00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,130
these great pads offerings that allow

00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:03,290
them the promise of infinite scalability

00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:05,660
because when you're writing new code you

00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:09,200
believe any promise in the world right

00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:11,240
and and you have no legacy right the

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,890
second you have real legacy is when your

00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,560
business starts having customers and

00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:16,790
then you realize that every bit of code

00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,800
that you wrote that you intended to

00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:23,810
throw away is already legacy that you

00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,820
can't get rid of you know and it may be

00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:28,490
that when you're you know when you're

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:32,600
you end up locked into a certain pass

00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:34,100
offering and that's fine but it doesn't

00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:38,180
do anything for your legacy stuff right

00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:41,570
so right so that's that's what an eyas

00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:44,360
platform does are you looking seriously

00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:49,040
at any of that any of the ayah stuff at

00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:51,530
this point no why not I asked you why

00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:54,740
not I say we are the solution to your

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:57,470
problems dr. eucalyptus is snake oil is

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:59,750
exactly what you need sir it'll put hair

00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:02,180
back on your head and also more on your

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:05,240
chest if you need it solve all your vm

00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:07,910
problems I understand that there's

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,570
there's some political stuff we're two

00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:13,340
different IT groups I am I work for

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:15,200
University and we have our central IT

00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,480
group and I'm one of the individual

00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,010
college IT groups mmm so when we do

00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:21,050
stuff the duplicates with central IT

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,490
does which we already have quite a bit

00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:26,780
of overlap favor I don't like that and

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,630
some of the cloud stuff especially with

00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,490
Amazon I'm concerned it's not not that I

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,540
don't trust amazon the billing model of

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:39,179
pay-as-you-go is sometimes very it can

00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:41,940
really hurt you in oh yeah when the

00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:45,030
state well with oh yeah it's not even

00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:48,210
that you build too much here's an

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:50,179
example of what happened um I knew

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:53,330
someone a new department they had the

00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:55,950
least copier they would pay per page and

00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:57,780
that worked well except when the state

00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,510
budget freeze came down and you couldn't

00:22:57,780 --> 00:23:02,790
spend any money yeah so now you have an

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:08,370
academic department they could not make

00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:11,820
copies ah this is an admissions

00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:15,150
department yeah yeah yeah that's

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:18,090
unfortunate yeah so you know the it's

00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:20,610
more like okay you buy it outright and

00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:24,150
it's insurance you know you used to ride

00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:26,880
it when the bad time right that's right

00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:31,370
and and and the funny thing about the

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,929
Amazon model I love you amazon is that

00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,450
you don't necessarily understand where

00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:38,630
the costs are it's not like Amazon

00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:41,490
doesn't try to do a good job of

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:43,380
representing those costs they do but the

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,970
permutations of where you end up

00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,740
spending money because you spend it you

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,630
spend money on storage you spend it on

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:51,059
compute you spend it on network

00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,530
throughput right you spend different

00:23:51,059 --> 00:23:54,090
rates on never a network throughput

00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,730
going from different place to different

00:23:54,090 --> 00:24:00,270
place right and actually having all of

00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:03,120
that stuff in your head modeled properly

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:04,530
is surprisingly difficult and you think

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,420
you understand what you're going to be

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:08,640
spending and then suddenly three boxes

00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,010
the load hits 30 and you scale out to 10

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,020
boxes and the network spread is not what

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:16,429
you expected and your bill is you know

00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:16,429
hugely different yes

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:28,410
right of us have a set list I start

00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:31,560
again I don't see the advantage of

00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:34,620
amazon for a normal business that has a

00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:36,840
set load asset growth I see the

00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,870
advantage of hyper growth web

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,970
applications that one day they could get

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,650
on slashdot and have a million visitors

00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:46,500
in a few seconds alright that's

00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:48,540
advantage but for my business I get you

00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,130
know to vmware servers that are going to

00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,590
have my load for the next three years

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,960
yeah I don't in once i buy those

00:24:52,590 --> 00:25:01,650
hardware I don't pay anything else

00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:03,240
you're right you're exactly right I'll

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,210
disagree with you Greg I think that

00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,420
there's even a case there because when

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:11,640
we look at IT projects over time sixty

00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,040
percent of IT projects fail and so I

00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,410
think the rapid provisioning abilities

00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,690
that you get with I was trying to throw

00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,890
him a bone brother what I was trying to

00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,940
throw him a bone but yeah I don't agree

00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:27,360
with me the fact that it allows you to

00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:29,130
throw to throw things together faster

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,990
provision them faster means that instead

00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:32,220
of waiting eight weeks to get your

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:34,770
hardware vendor to ship you Hardware

00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:38,070
spend a week getting a tract provision

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:40,320
cabled right you know you do that in sub

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,300
15 minutes yeah and in fact I would sort

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,460
of turned I would actually turn around

00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:46,800
the model the question and say you're

00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:49,260
not necessarily interested in you know

00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,840
on-premise cloud but I don't understand

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,760
why if you have that small growth model

00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:59,220
why would you why you would even buy

00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,260
hardware in the first place no I'm

00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,670
saying put those loads in the cloud why

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:05,670
would you not put those loads directly

00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:07,950
in the cloud because the amortized cost

00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:11,400
of the hardware plus the maintenance of

00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:13,380
the hardware if you compare that to the

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,540
cost of putting a similar workload on

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:17,540
the cloud have you done that math

00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:30,789
right to get in house uh-huh my internet

00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:33,470
connection can be found right yeah

00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:36,289
interesting because it because you know

00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:38,240
and and service providers are you know

00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:40,759
they're going to you're going to do that

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,289
now because they're scared you know

00:26:40,759 --> 00:26:50,600
they're locking in customers all the

00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:52,519
time I've got a counterexample to to

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,139
your case are your customers coming

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:55,580
through that you're out the internet

00:26:54,139 --> 00:27:11,360
y'all talk amongst yourselves on it some

00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:14,450
water I love talks like this okay so

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,730
your applique you all your business is

00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,860
internally all your traffic you don't

00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,100
need you don't have customers coming in

00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:24,509
to your network you got just you know

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,230
do you consider your developers to be

00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:37,139
customers do you consider your

00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:38,279
developers to be customers so this yeah

00:27:37,139 --> 00:27:39,779
that's so this sounds like one of those

00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,659
cloud exceptions right when you've got a

00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:52,769
completely internal and you need to be

00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:55,230
internal for security reasons or oh so

00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:58,639
you got external bandwidth oh right so

00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:02,039
okay so yes external bandwidth issues so

00:27:58,639 --> 00:28:03,570
pardon me this is the India problem so

00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:05,850
you were just like every Indian

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,879
developer out there same kinda the same

00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:11,759
kind of profile where for whatever

00:28:08,879 --> 00:28:14,789
reason the full speed of the public

00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:16,679
internet doesn't quite reach you yet so

00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:18,029
I didn't understand that right and

00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:21,809
that's one of the reasons we're seeing a

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:24,509
ton of interest in South Asia in private

00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:25,919
cloud because they keep hearing all this

00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:28,559
cool stuff about all the stuff that

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,240
Amazon can do for them but for them to

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,759
actually get to Amazon is fairly

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,710
ridiculous so they want a version of

00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:38,970
something that that looks kind of like

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:40,559
Amazon locally and so on our IRC channel

00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:42,960
pound eucalyptus on freenode if you

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,669
should ever feel like swinging by the

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,169
number of folks who come in in the

00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:50,669
middle of the night when I'm trying to

00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:55,230
sleep and ask questions has done a

00:28:50,669 --> 00:28:56,669
significant it's sort of changed my

00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,450
schedule a little bit so I can be there

00:28:56,669 --> 00:28:59,159
to answer some of those questions

00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:00,389
they're all from India and there for

00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,059
that reason right there's a ton of

00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:05,820
people trying to set up this you know

00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:09,960
self-managed infrastructure that they

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:11,210
can use to deliver these services to you

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,679
know the people in their organization

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:15,809
and they can't get the real clouds so

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,399
they want to set up one of their own and

00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:19,019
I think it's you know and I think again

00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:21,509
it's worth it's worth talking a little

00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:26,399
bit about what it means to be cloud

00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:27,720
right what what cloud is so talk a

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,039
little bit about this because there's a

00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,769
lot of people saying a lot of things

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,110
about what cloud is and isn't and cloud

00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:36,570
is sort of

00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:38,720
you know it's one of these words here's

00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,280
the thing when open source was young

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,350
people ignored it and then it got to a

00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:45,480
certain level and everybody fought to

00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:47,160
define it right what do we think that

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,630
open source means this what we think

00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,640
well we felt when we think of open

00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:53,280
source we think of shared source Thank

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,049
You Microsoft that's wrong but ok and

00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,730
now we're gonna we're getting the same

00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:00,240
place with cloud right everybody wants

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:03,860
to define what cloud is so allow me to

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:08,280
offer my description of what cloud is

00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:10,169
first of all it's self service right you

00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,419
click a button that says give me a

00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:14,610
computer now will give me a server give

00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:17,850
me an instance give me a compute

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:20,820
capacity click a button boom here's your

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:22,790
ssh key thank you very much enjoy right

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:26,820
so it has to be self service to be cloud

00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:30,720
it has to be scalable to be cloud right

00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:33,150
and scalable means auto scalable which

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,580
means api's so when you bring up that

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:38,730
first server you want the ability to say

00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:41,970
on that first server first server here's

00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:44,760
a script and that script says when your

00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,350
load hits 30 you start up a second

00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:49,260
server that looks just like you here's

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:52,590
the recipe when your load goes down to

00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:54,870
one or under one you kill yourself

00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:58,890
unless you're the only server standing

00:30:54,870 --> 00:31:02,730
right so there's a little script you put

00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:05,100
that in and when you get / dotted your

00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:07,410
server spawn servers until it can handle

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:11,700
the load right so scaling that's another

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:14,970
fundamental piece of cloud and then

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:19,500
metering the ability to know how much

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:21,330
you or any user has spent right so you

00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,559
want and we call this charge back I

00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:24,330
guess some people called metering some

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:30,330
people call it charge back it's the

00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:33,510
ability to say you've spent too much so

00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:36,870
pay us on your credit card or you know

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:38,910
we'll turn you off right in the public

00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:40,679
cloud there's no such there's no ideas

00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:42,809
chargeback you just pay right hey you

00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,419
use 500 servers accidentally because

00:31:42,809 --> 00:31:47,309
your script went awry yoooo whats $1,500

00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:49,799
for yesterday please

00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:51,450
oops better check out that you want that

00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,860
cost certainty you better make sure that

00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:55,169
your auto scaling scripts work really

00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,889
well because if they don't it could cost

00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:04,440
you but even in an internal cloud model

00:31:58,889 --> 00:32:06,600
you know when you have 50 nodes that

00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:08,759
you're cutting up into VMs you want to

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,590
be able to say okay this department gets

00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:12,269
10 of those nodes and this department

00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:15,149
gets 10 in this department gets 20 and

00:32:12,269 --> 00:32:16,799
if you should run over you know we've

00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:18,779
got some flexibility but we've got some

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,909
rules and mechanisms that allow us to

00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:23,399
turn you on or off accordingly right

00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:25,230
that's what cloud is at least at the

00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,999
infrastructure level and if you are

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,460
providing those services you are

00:32:26,999 --> 00:32:30,559
providing cloud services right and if

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:32,820
you're not providing those services

00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:35,940
you're not providing cloud services

00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:39,809
right there's a more detailed and

00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:40,919
smarter explanation of this at NIST so

00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:43,320
that the National Institute of Standards

00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,659
and Technology and they define what

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,730
cloud is for the federal government so

00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:48,720
if you want to go to if you if you want

00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,639
to sort of have a better understanding

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,269
of what everyone means when they say

00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:56,039
cloud computing go to NIST gov and look

00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:58,019
for their cloud computing bulletins and

00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,749
there's all kinds of good stuff there by

00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:02,399
the way there are eucalyptus customer so

00:33:00,749 --> 00:33:04,590
there are a lot of services online like

00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:06,210
Google Drive for example all they're

00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:08,730
literally store your documents in the

00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:12,240
cloud and so we just say they're a cloud

00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:14,970
service because they act like like you

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,740
say internally or would you say that

00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:19,350
doesn't really fit the definition of the

00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,929
club well I mean it sort of does itself

00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:23,669
certitude to me it's not cloud computing

00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:25,230
unless the computing is being done in

00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:27,389
the clouds that's cloud storage service

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:29,340
but to me that's not cloud computing

00:33:27,389 --> 00:33:31,529
right and I guess I should have been

00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,450
more clear the cloud computing a cloud

00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:35,039
definition I gave you is not in fact the

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:38,369
definition of cloud it is the definition

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,710
of cloud computing so storage is not

00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:44,249
computing hence those are not cloud

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:46,519
computing examples thanks for clarifying

00:33:44,249 --> 00:33:46,519
yeah

00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:55,730
you're gonna be like Phil Donahue over

00:33:53,179 --> 00:33:56,960
here get that mic over there is anyone

00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:10,700
remember who Phil Donahue is anymore

00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:14,450
sorry still hold that you provided

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:16,970
because you know on demand self-service

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:18,379
scalable and measurable regardless of

00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:20,240
whether you're talking about platform

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:23,210
infrastructure or software as a service

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,830
that's still that's still the lowest

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:28,580
common denominator between all three of

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:30,109
those yeah is Google Drive cloud well it

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,850
meets the definition it's probably

00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:34,669
software as a service or maybe store

00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:37,040
storages storage as a service if its

00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:38,090
cloud if it has AAS after it all right

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,369
that's another way of telling if its

00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:42,230
cloud if it's something as a service so

00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:47,450
zombies as a service margaritas as a

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:50,659
service tacos as a service yeah that's

00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:52,190
all cloud uh all right so I'll move on

00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:54,020
to it's time to it's time to go it's

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:55,340
unless there are any pressing questions

00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:00,910
it's time for me to go pure product

00:34:55,340 --> 00:35:00,910
pitch now is the time get ready oh yes I

00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,660
actually distinguished between

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,640
scalability and elasticity because right

00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,650
fair enough so I think you were

00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,510
referring to elasticity yeah i'm

00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:18,230
referring to elasticity and auto scaling

00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:20,859
that's right although you sort of get

00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,359
manual scalability is sort of manual

00:35:20,859 --> 00:35:24,950
elasticity right the ability for the the

00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:27,500
ability for the sysadmin not to have

00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,750
that API that auto scales but to say oh

00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,520
I think I just got slashed audit push

00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:34,970
that button five more times and five

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,560
more VMs show up I think in terms of

00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:38,090
auto scaling first but you're quite

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,800
right the manual version of auto scaling

00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:43,760
is also part of the scaling cloud idea

00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,190
so I'm going to talk a little bit about

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,170
the history of eucalyptus and

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,819
where we come from what we've been doing

00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:54,339
what we're doing now what going to be in

00:35:49,819 --> 00:35:59,300
doing in the in the near future so

00:35:54,339 --> 00:36:00,710
eucalyptus this is an acronym would

00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:05,420
anyone care to guess what that is an

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:06,950
acronym for eucalyptus it's a bunch of

00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:11,390
blah blah blah that's not even close

00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:13,930
right yeah so that was unfair I

00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:17,900
should've asked all right it's a elastic

00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:20,800
utility computing architecture linking

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:24,680
your programs to useful systems

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:27,670
eucalyptus awesome yes I deserve a big

00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:36,800
big props for remembering that that's

00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:38,869
and how it's a great question where's

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,910
the mic for him how long did it take for

00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:44,569
you to come up with that well here's how

00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:47,300
it worked the engineers when they so the

00:36:44,569 --> 00:36:49,609
project was started in 2007 i want to

00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,790
say as a UC Santa Barbara research

00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:57,609
project under professor rich Wolski and

00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:59,660
his cadre of loyal graduate students and

00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:01,220
they hacked some code they're like we're

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:02,300
gonna make our own amazon woohoo and

00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,560
they hacked a bunch of code and hacked a

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,730
bunch of code and they got to a place

00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,440
where they're like oh this might

00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,730
actually do something and we might want

00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,569
to make a company what we call the

00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:14,300
company well let's take a bunch of words

00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:16,040
that we think are representative and

00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:18,170
then we are going to put those words

00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,690
into a program that one of these dudes

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:23,480
wrote to go through and and come up with

00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,579
all of the possible acronyms from all of

00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,410
these things so systems and elasticity

00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:30,200
and utility computing we're about

00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,849
utility computing is it a platform no we

00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,440
think it's an architecture so let's call

00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:36,079
it unfroze let's put them all in and

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,450
eucalyptus is what came out along with

00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,099
sep maybe several others see this is the

00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:44,750
part of the story I don't actually know

00:37:40,099 --> 00:37:46,970
what were those other choices so if

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:48,890
someone is tweeting someone treat tweet

00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:50,900
rich Wolski and ask him what the other

00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:52,490
choices were if I don't remember to do

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,520
that because I think that would be

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:58,099
fascinating and a key part of any

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,529
presentation I would give

00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:02,630
so right so they came up with this

00:38:00,529 --> 00:38:06,349
software it was awesome it kind of

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:07,999
worked it was kind of close to Amazon at

00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:09,200
the time and then two weeks later amazon

00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:10,789
released another feature and it was

00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,619
already you know three months behind or

00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,940
whatever because that's the way it's

00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:15,890
always going to be right no matter how

00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,630
good eucalyptus is amazon is always

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:21,589
going to be ahead of us and that's okay

00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,329
right our job is to give a good enough

00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:25,670
subsection of services that is

00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:27,739
completely faithful to amazon that you

00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:29,569
can rely upon and if there are features

00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:31,970
you need an amazon you go get them from

00:38:29,569 --> 00:38:33,349
amazon right or you write them for

00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:38,950
eucalyptus and then give us the patches

00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:41,869
that would be great where was I right so

00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:44,839
formed a company in 2009 in Santa

00:38:41,869 --> 00:38:50,710
Barbara made the code base open source

00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:53,299
the 1.5 version released under the GPL

00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:54,769
lots and lots of interest I was at red

00:38:53,299 --> 00:38:57,640
hat at the time I spent a decade at Red

00:38:54,769 --> 00:39:01,549
Hat before I ended up at eucalyptus

00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,559
that's another story and when I was at

00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:05,660
Red Hat one of the things that I was

00:39:03,559 --> 00:39:08,180
working on was the fedora cloud special

00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:09,650
interest group so I was you know and the

00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:11,509
reason we started the fedora cloud sig

00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:14,239
was because it's complete tangent but I

00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:18,130
like it was because we were trying to

00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:21,019
get decent fedora images on to ec2

00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:23,150
because and I don't know how many of you

00:39:21,019 --> 00:39:27,229
you know know the sort of guts of how

00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:29,960
you see two works but you've got an

00:39:27,229 --> 00:39:32,630
Amazon kernel image and Amazon ramdisk

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,359
and an Amazon machine images right so

00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:37,099
the aki the AR I and the am I and the

00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:39,559
only thing that a customer has the right

00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:41,930
to upload is the am I so you can create

00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:44,450
all of your am eyes all you want but

00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:47,599
they have to refer to existing AK is an

00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:50,299
AR is already in the system so what that

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:53,630
means is that you can take an image

00:39:50,299 --> 00:39:56,239
remix it save it and and that's your

00:39:53,630 --> 00:40:00,410
your new image but if the only colonel

00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:02,719
there is from say fedora six then every

00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:05,210
machine image is going to be based on

00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,430
fedora six and if you're at the Fedora

00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:09,470
project and you're seeing people trying

00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,990
to get Drupal

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:15,050
six and php5 and all this stuff running

00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:16,910
on a fedora six colonel you're thinking

00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,160
wow we should really figure out how to

00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:21,770
get them the latest kernel so we had a

00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:23,390
project in fedora that you know its

00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:24,830
original goal was to figure out how to

00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:28,640
make sure that amazon would update their

00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:30,560
kernels and this how i first found out

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,940
about eucalyptus we started up the the

00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,260
cloud special interest group and i

00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:34,820
started the mailing list and i said

00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:36,710
hello to everybody and said hey we're

00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:39,170
having a cloud party and two of the

00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:40,790
first five people on the mailing list

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:45,830
were from eucalyptus so i thought yeah

00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:47,420
awesome open source and eucalyptus ended

00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:49,099
up being pulled into a relationship with

00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:52,010
canonical so that they were the basis of

00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:54,200
the ubuntu enterprise cloud UEC anyone

00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,450
here have any familiarity with you ec

00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:00,820
right so eucalyptus was the original

00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:05,180
base of UEC both growing companies

00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:09,170
things get crazy you know we we ended up

00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:11,690
breaking up you know and so now we've

00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:15,500
got a UEC kid that we have joint custody

00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:16,790
of and and you know we have visitation

00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,490
rights and so forth and that's nice it's

00:41:16,790 --> 00:41:28,040
civil they're nice people but we both

00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:30,530
moved on and at about the same time we

00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,490
started getting customers right like

00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:37,580
customers who were paying money and we

00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:39,410
they needed patches in a hurry and so

00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:42,080
right around the time we released

00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:43,910
version 2 0 and this is and I tell this

00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,950
story because of this is how open source

00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:50,480
businesses evolved right and it's

00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:52,099
fascinating so we made a fork and the

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,440
fork had the open-source version and the

00:41:52,099 --> 00:41:57,530
Enterprise version right and the

00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:00,050
Enterprise version had proprietary hooks

00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:01,820
to other things because customers

00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:03,770
immediately started saying this is

00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:05,690
awesome where's the VMware driver or

00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:09,710
like I kind of haven't written it yet

00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:11,560
right be a boy drops below they go but

00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:14,570
we couldn't give that out as open source

00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,160
because it's VMware we didn't have the

00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:18,589
right to give that out as open source we

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,690
were using hooks in the VMware API that

00:42:18,589 --> 00:42:22,040
are not available for open consumption

00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,360
we can just give it out as part of open

00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,780
source projects we made this

00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,340
work and we paid lots of attention to

00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:29,660
the enterprise for because that's what

00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,520
the customers are asking for and they're

00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:35,210
banging on us for new request right so

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,250
boom boom boom boom with the best of

00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:38,960
intentions of making sure that any patch

00:42:37,250 --> 00:42:40,370
that was an open source patch would get

00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,490
ported back over the open source version

00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:48,140
tenants ah well as you do you know

00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:50,030
customers get angry they demand more

00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,680
change we ended up maintaining the EE

00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,150
branch and then a couple more branches

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,880
and soon we've got this whole eee

00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:57,980
infrastructure that is cooking right all

00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:59,890
kinds of codes going on there and we'd

00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:03,470
pour it over a patch maybe once a month

00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:06,350
maybe once every three months maybe once

00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,180
a year right it doesn't take long for

00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,740
this before people start going well

00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:11,780
eucalyptus was cool but I guess they're

00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:13,850
dead no no wait no look we've got all

00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,260
these customers really cuz no but well

00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:19,040
you're not an open source company oh

00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,480
you're right oh you're right you're

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,920
right so we sort of stopping you know

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,200
source comfy for a while as he is the

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,240
upshot of that is before I came off by

00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,730
the way and this was my job right

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,980
because they knew it they knew it and

00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:32,870
they're like look we're going to get

00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:34,910
back on the open-source train we pinkie

00:43:32,870 --> 00:43:37,820
swear and we need your help to do it so

00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,540
on the fund the community guy now and so

00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,860
they spent basically a year and a half

00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:46,820
splitting all this stuff back out so

00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:48,740
eucalyptus 31 which is on github now so

00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,750
if you go github com / eucalyptus you

00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,940
can see all the goodies minus the

00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:54,530
actually relatively small Delta of

00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:56,750
proprietary code that talks to those

00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,460
proprietary offerings we actually split

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:01,790
that out and firewalled it off so it's

00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,010
actually separate and the rest of it is

00:44:01,790 --> 00:44:05,510
on github so if you go to github com /

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:09,590
eucalyptus you'll see all of our code

00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:12,710
including the eucalyptus code and that's

00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:14,630
31 beta and 31 release will be sometime

00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:16,970
later this month and we also have a

00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,500
product out there called fast start so

00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:20,570
if you go to the eucalyptus com site

00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:23,120
you'll see the fast start for version

00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:26,960
203 in a couple of weeks you'll see the

00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:32,030
fast start version 431 where you can

00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:34,970
start up your own cloud in I did it in

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:35,950
12 minutes so your own private cloud 12

00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:37,600
minutes

00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,540
you will probably take three hours the

00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,760
first time that's okay come to the IRC

00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:46,660
channel and we'll help you through it

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,730
you need this is my kit to laptops one

00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:52,110
laptop which is the front end which is

00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:56,440
the web interface the storage controller

00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:57,820
the cluster controller and all the bits

00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,000
that glue it together and that's a bunch

00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:03,460
of Java and C code and so forth and then

00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,350
you have a node controller and the node

00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,110
controller is the thing that scales up

00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:11,020
so you basically have one front end and

00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:13,480
several node controllers in my demo kit

00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:17,020
which I didn't have today because it's a

00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:21,420
cloud expo New York next week and

00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:23,770
they're bigger than you are so sorry so

00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,120
you set up the node controller then you

00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:26,680
set up the front end to talk to the node

00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,390
controller and boom you're up and

00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:30,940
running right and you go to the the

00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:34,750
front end and you say give me virtual

00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:39,460
machines start me to VMS and it goes to

00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:41,590
its vast number of NCS it looks and says

00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,810
tell me what NCS are out there in my

00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:46,720
data center and the other little laptop

00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:49,390
says I have for VMS for you and it says

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,750
great give me for VMS right and that

00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:55,990
little thing looks exactly like Amazon

00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:59,680
does from the ec2 plus s3 perspective

00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:03,250
right so if you run you could describe

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,470
instances you will see a list of running

00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,750
instances if you use you could describe

00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,880
images it will give you a list of all of

00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:16,750
the images that are available in your

00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:19,150
availability zone right so yeah fast

00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:25,740
start so check it out it's it's dead

00:46:19,150 --> 00:46:25,740
easy yes

00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,609
well so yes assuming you can actually

00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:42,619
move stuff out of your gov cloud but yes

00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:46,250
I mean it all uses the same API or so

00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:48,920
this is and understand this working with

00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:51,260
the public cloud has a lot of caveats

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:53,740
around it still right no matter who you

00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:56,089
go with who is a private eye is

00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:59,390
infrastructure provider there's still

00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:02,569
some gaps but the tooling is the same

00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:05,359
and the machine image formats are the

00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:07,760
same so that if you've got an am I on

00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:11,390
your public or your gov cloud instance

00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,119
you can pull that image in in a large

00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:16,369
number of cases basically just pull it

00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:18,470
right to the local s3 server we call it

00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:20,990
walrus so our version of s3 is called

00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:23,539
walrus you pull that image from s3 to

00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:25,880
walrus and you launch it the same way

00:47:23,539 --> 00:47:28,339
you launch it there with the new that's

00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:30,410
an ami and has an ami code this is an

00:47:28,339 --> 00:47:32,990
EMI and has an EMI code and they're

00:47:30,410 --> 00:47:34,789
different but you you map between the

00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:36,769
two and then you launch this and boom

00:47:34,789 --> 00:47:41,000
it's running and it's exactly the same

00:47:36,769 --> 00:47:42,470
right so on I run into the issue about

00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,740
the the kernel that you talked about

00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:47,750
right because I'm the boy that I'm

00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:48,950
working with we want to handle it we

00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:53,359
want to create everything that we have

00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:55,970
right so uh on Gulf cloud the instances

00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,990
that they had you know were not built by

00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:02,990
us so I built one on AWS which is what

00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:04,670
we run there i tried i ported that how

00:48:02,990 --> 00:48:06,950
to the golf club in the porting were

00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:08,390
great but it would not boot up because

00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:10,759
the kernel that I used on the edori

00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:12,440
aside was not available on the golf club

00:48:10,759 --> 00:48:14,420
right so i know that i'm going to run

00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,369
into this a couple more time so you're

00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:18,109
going to the reason and this is this is

00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:20,450
actually an advantage for eucalyptus

00:48:18,109 --> 00:48:22,250
because you can pull down whatever

00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:23,779
colonel they're running and run it on

00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:27,920
eucalyptus but you can't go the other

00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:30,289
way right you have access to the EK is

00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,420
and there are part of the image bundling

00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:34,490
process locally you will never have

00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:37,910
access to the AK is unless you're like a

00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:39,300
super uber customer or partner right so

00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:42,210
in your use case

00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:44,010
that difference between the two AK is it

00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:47,130
may be a problem where you just picked

00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:48,960
the wrong am I or you picked you pick

00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,720
the wrong aki to boot to and it may not

00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,820
have been clear that the aki over here

00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:55,530
is analogous to this aki and gov cloud

00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:57,270
it's probably the problem he ran into

00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,350
because they run a lot of zen and they

00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,880
run different version of zen in

00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:01,590
different places from what i understand

00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,390
yeah and they've got some mechanisms

00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:05,310
like I think right now they're moving

00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:06,960
towards a single kernel model where they

00:49:05,310 --> 00:49:08,790
basically have abstracted all of that

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,340
away but there's still a lot of images

00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:14,130
out there that are running old Colonels

00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,390
and you have that mapping issue okay so

00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:19,700
where I was trying to get take my

00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:22,950
question to is if I set up a eucalyptus

00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:25,140
emi what I guess would I be able to just

00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:27,060
poured that flow is linked to golf clubs

00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,520
I'm not gonna keep running into this yes

00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,250
presuming that you're using a Zen based

00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,960
NC right they've got Zen machine images

00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:35,490
you need to be running Zen locally to

00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,120
make sure that you've got compatibility

00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:41,520
at the kernel level okay so the the

00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:44,310
front end is one set of code and then

00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,840
the NCS run different configurations

00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:48,990
depending on which one you choose right

00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,700
so this this NC and what the end the NC

00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:54,270
is a node controller and it basically

00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:56,040
it's a see a thing that manages all of

00:49:54,270 --> 00:49:59,970
the VMS on that machine for a particular

00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,160
vm profile right so this NC might be

00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:04,440
running kvm only this NC might be

00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:06,600
running Zen only these two NCS might be

00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:08,400
running the vmware broker right so you

00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:10,340
need to make sure that whatever AK is

00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,380
Andy chaos are moving back and forth

00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:16,740
you're using Zen on the NC that you're

00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:19,020
running this stuff long all right so if

00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:20,250
I could try and define eucalyptus Peck

00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,160
just based on the things that you're

00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:26,830
talking about today it's a it lets you

00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:30,300
set up a hybrid cloud on Amazon

00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:37,030
the self-service automatic scaling and

00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:38,410
metering is that so kinda it provides

00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:41,470
you it definitely provides you a self

00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:44,140
service it provides you the opportunity

00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,730
for cell scaling and the opportunity for

00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,320
metering and you got to write some code

00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,880
to make it work better okay but that's

00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:50,800
okay we'll be getting farther than that

00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,360
in the coming releases right auto

00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:55,540
scaling right now is a feature that

00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:57,160
Amazon provides that we do not sow but

00:50:55,540 --> 00:50:59,170
you can do some pretty quick and dirty

00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:02,920
auto scaling the works really well right

00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:05,290
so because the whole point is the API is

00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,760
what's necessary the API to say go start

00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:08,320
me another machine it started under

00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:13,900
these criteria stop it under these

00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:17,800
criteria and then the the auto scaling

00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:19,630
pieces are amazon has some of those

00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:21,670
baked in for the most common use cases

00:51:19,630 --> 00:51:23,320
that will basically manufacture those

00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:24,730
scripts for you based on the arguments

00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:27,160
you give it and we're looking to have

00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:30,400
that sometime the next year cool okay

00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:33,430
and a second question the are you are

00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:36,010
pointing to some people in here who have

00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:38,350
our competitors yes CloudStack stand up

00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,970
clouds Dax I'd like to hear from like

00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:41,380
your thoughts about each other and like

00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:43,060
what you guys are better suited for

00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:47,110
maybe as soon as we get out of here I'm

00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:50,380
going to punch him dead in the face no

00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:52,230
so uh a funny thing so we're both on the

00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,490
gloucester advisory board together and

00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:56,200
we both sort of grew up together in

00:51:54,490 --> 00:51:57,610
fedora right when i was the fedora

00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,950
project leader he was one of the first

00:51:57,610 --> 00:52:01,960
north america i think were you the first

00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,640
north america fedora ambassador I

00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,930
probably wasn't the first I was the

00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,710
first thing you were the first one who

00:52:04,930 --> 00:52:09,940
cleared out it's terrible now maybe

00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:12,550
Clint was the first one who did anything

00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:15,430
but yeah so we you know and we're both

00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:18,970
the door guys and have been forever yeah

00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:20,590
so yeah so we we both get along there's

00:52:18,970 --> 00:52:22,060
actually some conversations going on in

00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:25,480
both of our communities right now about

00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:29,560
code sharing because a lot of the things

00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:32,650
that we are trying to achieve our are

00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,930
very similar and so one of the beauties

00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,290
of open sources that we can both utilize

00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:39,850
those common parts

00:52:37,290 --> 00:52:43,840
some of the things that that

00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:46,480
differentiate us you know we chose the

00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:49,720
alternate API but we also support ec2

00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:53,860
but it's certainly at the moment it's a

00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:58,350
second tier player API for us and the

00:52:53,860 --> 00:53:02,650
second issue is we we focused early on a

00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:05,290
beautiful GUI that that honestly people

00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:07,060
don't use unless they're truly end users

00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:09,280
they don't use long-term but it does a

00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:13,750
great job of selling the product it does

00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:16,300
it less it looks and we are envious you

00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:20,830
know we've we've gone after a lot of our

00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:23,050
early real heavy users were were public

00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:25,390
providers who said oh Amazon's doing

00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:28,720
this I want to sell something similar

00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:31,660
and to hear Greg talk they seem to be

00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,670
focusing on the on private cloud yeah it

00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:37,090
is it's pretty clear and it's a pretty

00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:39,520
clear distinction between a user

00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:43,110
customer segments as well because the

00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:46,510
enterprise clouds have a different need

00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:49,660
then then then the sort of competitors

00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:51,100
to Amazon right it's different scale

00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:52,900
different pieces of the puzzle are

00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:55,210
important so yes our focus right now is

00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:57,880
on enterprise on-premise cloud right so

00:53:55,210 --> 00:54:01,120
so our tends to be public provider and

00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:04,030
that greenfield web scale company like

00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:08,050
the big gaming companies that that

00:54:04,030 --> 00:54:09,610
behave very much like an Amazon but just

00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,860
don't sell to Alcide customers or don't

00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:15,250
sell computing yeah sources style side

00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:16,330
customers yes you might know them you

00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:18,100
might know their customers but they

00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:20,350
carry their like order that's a the most

00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:21,730
of our customers are yes so worry guys

00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:23,230
so it's like two minutes does that two

00:54:21,730 --> 00:54:25,660
minutes and we're done or two minutes

00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:31,870
plus questions or like now we're like

00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:34,750
one minute all right toes Greg can I can

00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:38,200
I go back to your workload migration yes

00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:40,800
do you actually see people moving doing

00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:45,970
large-scale moving of am eyes and a

00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:48,940
chaos so not huge scale but in very

00:54:45,970 --> 00:54:50,599
particular cases it's key yeah so i

00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,559
would actually think that that

00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:53,479
they would have solved that with

00:54:51,559 --> 00:54:56,839
configuration management so that you

00:54:53,479 --> 00:54:59,809
effectively end at the same end point is

00:54:56,839 --> 00:55:01,339
is that more common or less common or I

00:54:59,809 --> 00:55:02,690
think that different people have

00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:05,089
different reasons for doing it

00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:07,309
differently right the the chief reason

00:55:05,089 --> 00:55:09,979
for ripping out ripping a full image and

00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:12,859
moving it over is that once you cash

00:55:09,979 --> 00:55:16,420
that image startup time of that image

00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:19,039
completely baked is like seconds and

00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:20,359
post configuration tools like puppet or

00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,759
chef or ansible or something like that

00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:24,829
can take you quite a while depending on

00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:27,499
the relative complexity of the of the

00:55:24,829 --> 00:55:29,479
the workload right so in those cases

00:55:27,499 --> 00:55:32,569
where they've got very well-defined

00:55:29,479 --> 00:55:34,700
workloads that seldom change they

00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:39,440
absolutely use image portability all the

00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:40,880
time and we're seeing you know and we've

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,400
only got a handful of customers who are

00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,220
really using that largely because we're

00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,019
still working on some pods on some of it

00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:49,640
but no we're and that we're working hard

00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:52,630
on making sure that that is rock solid

00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:55,789
so i think we probably need to wrap up

00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:57,229
so but i'll be out when week if you have

00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:58,700
any questions please come to me and

00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,680
follow up and ask because i'll be here

00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:04,059
until everyone is done asking me

00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,059
questions and then i'll drive home okay

00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:17,580
the speaker review for whatever we're

00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:21,660
calling it these days it's available to

00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:25,760
have the check-in desk it is the raffle

00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:25,760
ticket for this evening

00:56:46,339 --> 00:56:55,730
all right take the mic when I'm done

00:56:48,599 --> 00:56:55,730
when you need me to get out all right

00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:10,800
where do you see to select guest FS in

00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:12,450
this continuum necessary for breaking

00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:18,140
into images and fiddling with them

00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:21,450
certainly can't you apply automation and

00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:23,369
create baked images yeah there's a lot

00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,920
of and there's going to be and right now

00:57:23,369 --> 00:57:28,200
i'm not super happy with our tools story

00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:29,820
yet there's a lot of good tools out

00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,829
there to do this kind of stuff you know

00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:34,230
guest FS for going in cracking images

00:57:31,829 --> 00:57:37,410
and fiddling with them is a tool that I

00:57:34,230 --> 00:57:38,760
know that some of our guys are using you

00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:40,140
know when you've got the camp between

00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,300
baked and fried right you've got the

00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:44,250
folks who want an image and they want to

00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:46,200
crack that image make very specific

00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:47,700
changes and then redistribute that image

00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,589
right that's one family of folks and

00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:51,480
they tend to use guest FS and associated

00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:53,130
tools and then you've got the other

00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,520
folks and I'm wearing this latter camp

00:57:53,130 --> 00:57:58,230
in my god I'm a recipe guy right I want

00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,819
to see how that image was made and I

00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:01,530
want to see the provenance all the way

00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:05,609
from the kickstart file that was and

00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:09,510
remember I'm a red hat fedora RPM kind

00:58:05,609 --> 00:58:11,550
of guy so I want to see the kickstart

00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:13,020
file that was used to create it and then

00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,970
I want to see the post section that was

00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,349
used to put together whatever lay down

00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:17,700
whatever bits for further systems

00:58:16,349 --> 00:58:19,589
management and then I want to see the

00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:22,079
chef's recipe or the puppet recipe where

00:58:19,589 --> 00:58:24,960
the shell script or the ansible recipe

00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:27,180
that turned it into whatever it is right

00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:28,829
and I think those two those are the two

00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:31,140
sort of opposite ends of the spectrum

00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:33,089
and I think that most sis admin's find

00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:35,430
themselves in all kinds of places midway

00:58:33,089 --> 00:58:36,869
through right on the recipe side of the

00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:41,099
world I find that a tool that I really

00:58:36,869 --> 00:58:44,190
like to use is box grinder so you know

00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:45,750
it's basically it's it was written by

00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:48,690
some of the jboss guys and it does a

00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:50,660
really good job of giving you that sort

00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,070
of all in 1 push button I

00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,600
image that looks like this and it

00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:55,490
basically sucks in a kickstart and

00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:58,700
builds you out and image in a number of

00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:00,830
formats one of them is supposed to be a

00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:02,900
eucalyptus image as soon as we fix a

00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:04,940
couple of bugs and we gotta you know but

00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:07,130
yeah there's a whole bunch of tools out

00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:09,140
there I think their nascent and I think

00:59:07,130 --> 00:59:11,780
that cloud is going to force those

00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:13,130
mature those tools to maturity in a way

00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:15,280
that they've never really been forced to

00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:18,320
because cloud hasn't really existed

00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:20,870
before right the existence of a real

00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,580
cloud world means that system management

00:59:20,870 --> 00:59:24,320
tools are going to be fundamentally

00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,670
changing and accelerating in a way that

00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:29,000
they never have because there wasn't

00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:30,620
enough shared knowledge to do it if you

00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:32,330
go to the puppet channel there's like

00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:34,730
how many people in the puppet IRC

00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:37,220
channel like 1500 or 2000 it's

00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:38,660
ridiculous so the amount of shared

00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:41,630
knowledge on system management

00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:42,860
configuration has just exploded all

00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,400
right if you need me I'll be out there

00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:45,400
thank you

01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,500
you

01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:27,770
when we created asterisk over a decade

01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:29,750
ago we could not have imagined that

01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,940
asterisk would not only become the most

01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,100
widely adopted open source communication

01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:36,110
software on the planet but that it would

01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:38,630
impact the entire industry in the way

01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:40,610
that it has today asterisk has found its

01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:43,250
way in the more than 170 countries and

01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:45,200
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:47,300
success of asterisk has enabled a

01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,710
transition of power from the hands of

01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:50,990
the traditional proprietary phone

01:00:48,710 --> 01:00:53,360
vendors into the hands of the users and

01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:55,310
administrators of phone systems using

01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,540
this power our customers have created

01:00:55,310 --> 01:00:58,490
all sorts of business changing

01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:00,320
applications from small office phone

01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:02,870
systems to mission-critical call centers

01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:04,460
the international carrier networks in

01:01:02,870 --> 01:01:06,230
fact there's even an entire country

01:01:04,460 --> 01:01:08,840
those communications infrastructure runs

01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:10,760
on esters the gym has always been about

01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,470
creating technology that expands

01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:14,660
communications capabilities in ways that

01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:15,830
we could never have imagined and that's

01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,230
part of what's game-changing about

01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:20,930
Digium today we're doing it again this

01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:23,030
time by introducing a new family of HD

01:01:20,930 --> 01:01:25,130
IP phones that extends control of the

01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:26,900
user all the way to the desktop the

01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:28,610
launch of these new products represents

01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:30,710
the next phase indigenous history of

01:01:28,610 --> 01:01:33,110
innovation these are the first and only

01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:34,820
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,380
power of estrus when we first discussed

01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,390
our expectations for building a family

01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:40,550
of phones for use with asterisk our

01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:42,290
requirements were pretty simple we asked

01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,940
the team to build the phones such that

01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:46,130
they were easy to install integrate

01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:47,960
provision and use I think you'll soon

01:01:46,130 --> 01:01:50,540
agree our engineers have delivered on

01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:52,160
that goal user feedback is validating

01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:54,290
that when it comes to operation with

01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:56,720
Astra space systems including our own

01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:59,300
Switchvox based product these are the

01:01:56,720 --> 01:02:00,590
easiest to use best integrated most

01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:03,170
interoperable products on the market

01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:05,170
today the digitally of phones will

01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:07,220
initially include three IP des hommes

01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:09,170
uniquely designed to complement any

01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:11,030
asterisks or switch box based solution

01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:13,700
these phones are different for a number

01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:16,370
of reasons first there is clue sively

01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:17,780
designed for use with esters secondly

01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:19,390
we've made it really easy to

01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:21,800
autodiscover and provision the phones

01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:23,870
next we've made it easy for the phones

01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,420
to access information inside of asterisk

01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:27,420
allowing tight coupling

01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:29,410
between an application and the phone

01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:31,569
additionally we've created an

01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:33,670
applications engineer that allows users

01:02:31,569 --> 01:02:36,280
and developers to create and run their

01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:38,349
own apps on the following and finally

01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:40,390
we've done all of this at a very

01:02:38,349 --> 01:02:42,099
compelling price point at Digium we're

01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,869
always thinking of ways to give our

01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:46,240
customers the best value in business

01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:48,130
phone systems and also give them the

01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,260
power to create their own solutions or

01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:52,059
any communications challenge well

01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:53,829
continue to push the boundaries not only

01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:55,900
to make Astra's cooler faster and more

01:02:53,829 --> 01:02:57,640
technologically feature-rich but to make

01:02:55,900 --> 01:03:00,190
asterisk and communications even easier

01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:03,119
and together we'll change the way the

01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:03,119
world communication again

01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:21,580
prospects I every way this is the way to

01:03:17,890 --> 01:03:23,530
better utilize all your resources and it

01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,560
makes managing all your resources pretty

01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:31,420
easy all of the innovation is happening

01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:34,780
in open source the collaborative nature

01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:37,450
and of the you know of the community and

01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:39,340
the speed at which these are these you

01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:41,440
know these these deficiencies these bugs

01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:44,050
are getting discovered and then fixed is

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,380
it like that really shows the power of

01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:49,030
the of the open source community it is

01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:53,230
global and it's definitely because of

01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:59,560
the users community people are extremely

01:03:53,230 --> 01:04:01,330
friendly and always ready to help if you

01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:03,010
go an entire see any day you'll see

01:04:01,330 --> 01:04:04,870
these guys helping each other out and

01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:07,780
they're all doing it like in a selfless

01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:09,610
manner the product is transparent for

01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:13,810
everyone everyone can look at the code

01:04:09,610 --> 01:04:15,850
base everyone can see how close duck is

01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:21,700
being built nothing nothing is

01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:24,370
proprietary everything is open in many

01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:28,570
ways it's absolutely vital to the the

01:04:24,370 --> 01:04:32,320
ongoing health cloudstack the most

01:04:28,570 --> 01:04:36,150
exciting event in recent memory for me

01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:38,880
was our first developer boot camp

01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:41,520
and our call gave people I gave me two

01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:45,480
weeks notice to come attend I was

01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:49,650
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:52,500
with 87 people and had to go get more

01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:55,020
chairs in the room twice everything

01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:58,349
within cloud computing is commodity and

01:04:55,020 --> 01:05:01,349
is open source and so I don't think that

01:04:58,349 --> 01:05:03,089
you will you'll see anywhere where open

01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:06,119
source is not pervasive in cloud

01:05:03,089 --> 01:05:08,849
computing and so i think it's i think

01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:10,200
it's an assumption i think when you talk

01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:11,309
about cloud computing you're really

01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:16,859
talking about open source cloud

01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:20,010
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

01:05:16,859 --> 01:05:22,410
for large deployments you have dozens of

01:05:20,010 --> 01:05:26,339
data centers and thousands of servers in

01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:28,980
each data center is these hardware is

01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:32,490
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:35,190
to handle number one that mass scale

01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:38,339
number two it's designed to handle the

01:05:35,190 --> 01:05:41,190
failure that inevitably happens in large

01:05:38,339 --> 01:05:45,420
deployments started working on pop stack

01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:48,660
over four years ago and it was the

01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:50,460
original set of people working on it and

01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:54,569
a background of delivering software

01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:58,799
telcos and service providers lots of QA

01:05:54,569 --> 01:06:02,430
lots of users actually using it high

01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:05,490
availability is a key feature multiple

01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:07,680
hypervisors support different network

01:06:05,490 --> 01:06:10,680
models we can pick up whatever suits you

01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,450
better while step management server can

01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:16,140
be deployed in different physical

01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:17,789
machines it definitely has a huge

01:06:16,140 --> 01:06:22,799
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

01:06:17,789 --> 01:06:25,380
there's a major movie studio that they

01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:28,680
were using cloudstack they were using it

01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:30,660
to transcode video and i thought that

01:06:28,680 --> 01:06:32,279
was terribly fascinating what i found

01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,549
more fascinating is what they did during

01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:38,339
lunch where they would spin up you know

01:06:35,549 --> 01:06:39,520
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:41,350
lunch was over they would

01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,610
all the instances and go back to doing

01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:47,110
real work CloudStack is vast it touches

01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:49,180
so many different aspects and there's no

01:06:47,110 --> 01:06:51,550
one person that's kind of like a master

01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:55,690
of all those realms I think clouds stack

01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:57,880
as a project is going to be one of the

01:06:55,690 --> 01:07:01,960
leaders simply because it's some of the

01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:07,390
most feature fallen and and robust

01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:10,290
platforms out they were I don't senior

01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,290
