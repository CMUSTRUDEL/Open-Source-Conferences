I'm Rob zero and height some of you

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,539
might know me from IRC in other places

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,879
I'm well I try to be a male consultant

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,520
in real life but that's not going too

00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:53,520
well so if you guys know any clients

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,649
that'll that are looking for male help

00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,390
there's my simple little web page and

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,390
it's if you can't read it because it's

00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:07,170
blue on blue stupiddope libre office

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:13,290
theme here that's Rob zero no dns for

00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:16,560
dot us I also do mail and DNS services

00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:21,570
for slack builds org and a few other

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,570
little things here and there this is my

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,020
second self I was here last year doing

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:31,500
another boring presentation about spam

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,600
and well this one's slightly different

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,600
than last year things are evolving so

00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,840
alrighty well that's my my theme I just

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,259
picked a default one out of a Libra

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,759
office and this is called recommendation

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,979
of a strategy and I thought that was

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,159
appropriate because we're that's what

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,020
we're all about here we're about

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,469
strategies to try and fight what the

00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,759
spammers are doing and we've got a nice

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:01,759
little maze down here in the corner

00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:17,550
okay I want to do a quick little preface

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:20,660
this is the talk was about the enemy

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:24,120
within spammer spam the enemy within and

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:26,870
it's about a well I hate to say it's a

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:33,480
new type of malware that they're using

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:35,130
but it's certainly a nasty one and I

00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:43,500
wanted to talk first a little bit about

00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:46,739
who the spammers in the world are the

00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:49,950
spam house project who does a lot to

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,080
protect people worldwide from the

00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:54,870
effects of spam have done a lot of

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,940
research into it and they maintain a

00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,260
thing they call the rock so the register

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,310
of known spam operations I gave the URL

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,330
there which you're not going to be able

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,820
to hit thanks to our lousy internet and

00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:13,140
that's another story I was up way too

00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:17,609
late last night trying to get the self

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:20,069
network going anyway on that page I've

00:03:17,609 --> 00:03:22,100
quoted from them it says that 100 spam

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,959
operations are responsible for

00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:31,739
approximately eighty percent of your

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:34,010
spam that's not very many and that's a

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,660
lot of spam when you consider that

00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:41,190
roughly it's hard to say exactly but

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:46,049
anywhere from 80 to 95 percent of all

00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:50,220
traffic on TCP port 25 is abuse it is

00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:56,519
spam eighty percent of that comes from

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:59,370
100 known operations each one according

00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,670
to Spamhaus typically consists of one to

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:08,130
five people and I use the term loosely

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:11,849
for approximately a grand total of 300

00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:15,390
to 400 people in the world I'm sorry

00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:16,400
that just boggles my mind that 400

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:19,299
people have been

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:27,050
able to make emails such a mess for

00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:28,880
everyone one thing I would like to ask

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,979
before we go any further is are there

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,889
any people in here that that work in

00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:41,449
mail or postmaster or even if you run

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:43,970
your own mail server good all right it's

00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:45,889
the talk is mostly to you folks but it's

00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:48,110
some hopefully it's not going to put

00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:59,090
everybody else to sleep we'll see if

00:04:48,110 --> 00:05:03,530
they were driving all night it might now

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:06,860
there's a ongoing cycle of how things

00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:08,510
change and as I mentioned before things

00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,650
have changed a little bit since last

00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:15,860
year one thing I've seen several times

00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:17,660
the what I call the enemy within I've

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,000
seen that several times in the past year

00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,400
fortunately I don't have any windows

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,010
users so it didn't hit me but I have

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,010
been called in to help a few times and

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,710
basically the way it works is the

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,169
spammer does something we mail

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,860
administrators and even end-users pick

00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:43,250
up on what it is they're doing and we do

00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:46,210
things to avoid that then they adapt

00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:49,639
they change their strategies to it to

00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:53,590
get around what we were doing to avoid

00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:53,590
them and it just goes on and on

00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:06,030
in the recent past it was mostly like

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:13,500
this and it still is mostly this way

00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:15,720
even now that spammers are using certain

00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,960
number of main tools and on this page

00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:26,340
I'm going to just touch on for them

00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:28,910
we're going to go into depth on how some

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,930
of these are used in further slides but

00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,020
their main tools and these are

00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:37,220
prioritized the main tool that spammers

00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,660
are using nowadays are the spam botnets

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:50,400
malware or like I like to call it rat

00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:53,430
where see our little maze and a second

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,410
secondary tool they're using is free

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,740
mail accounts from providers such as

00:06:55,410 --> 00:07:03,300
yahoo and hotmail and gmail and you name

00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:10,320
it they have scripted a lot of these web

00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:11,400
interfaces they do have some servers and

00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:15,840
networks that are under their own

00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:18,270
control and there are cases not very

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,810
many that are documented well that I

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:24,000
know of but that they've used cheaper or

00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:28,260
cheap labor in third-world countries and

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,800
sometimes even online games to help

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:35,540
break CAPTCHAs where they're not paying

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:38,640
any paying people and they're getting a

00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,470
free service for that from them why do

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,210
you think breaking captions is a good

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:47,190
thing for a spammer register for free

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:52,200
accounts exactly that's what they're

00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:56,190
doing and right that's that slide let's

00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,300
move on and we're not prioritized here

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:03,060
we're going to go we're going to talk

00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:05,040
about the spam networks first as it says

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,290
they're the direct sending from spammers

00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:10,260
from networks under their control is a

00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:11,760
waning tag tactic they are not doing

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:15,030
this as much as they had

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:19,380
bin and its continuing to decline it

00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:23,450
still exists here in USA we have a law

00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:25,920
called can spam or as people in the

00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:29,360
anti-spam community like to call it it's

00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:32,430
you can spam because it tried to

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:35,760
legitimize certain illegitimate

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:39,330
marketing practices basically it's okay

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,419
to steal email addresses and send

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,520
unsolicited bulk mail as long as you

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:46,290
meet these requirements you've got to

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,450
have unsubscribed links in the spam

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:52,970
you've got to give them a real sender

00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:57,510
address rather than Joe somebody at

00:08:52,970 --> 00:09:00,630
gmail and you also have has to have

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:03,500
other other contact information in the

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:07,560
spam now usually these unsubscribe links

00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:10,770
they might work but they might not do

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:12,870
what you expect sometimes you will click

00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:15,240
an unsubscribe link in a spam and you're

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,720
going to end up subscribe to other span

00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:22,440
lists there are certain kinds of

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,280
spammers that we call pink or pink

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:27,780
spammers or gray hat senders that

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,880
actually do try to launder their list

00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,820
and they try to keep it clean they don't

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:35,010
care if it's dirty coming in but when

00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:37,770
people complain they try to clean it up

00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:42,630
that accounts for the other twenty

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:46,710
percent that Spamhaus didn't that aren't

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:53,570
coming from the rocks of folks and some

00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:53,570
people do subscribe I mean go figure

00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:05,500
another type of spam that you'll see

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:08,020
from spammers networks is the what we

00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,000
call snowshoe spam and which snowshoe is

00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:12,130
kind of an alien concept to those of us

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,980
here in the south but I guess them

00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:17,290
Yankees strip tennis racket on their

00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:19,420
foot and walk across the snow with that

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:25,690
thing it spreads out the weight over a

00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:27,280
larger area and that's what snowshoe

00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,950
spam is all about they'll get a large

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,110
range of IP addresses and they'll send a

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:34,090
few from this one and a few from that

00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:38,170
one and then a few from another one and

00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:43,480
it just there's only a small amount

00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:45,930
hitting any particular spam trap so we

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:49,750
get to the what's called the whack Amole

00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,250
tactic you try to you see one pop up

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,990
here and you're whack it and you see one

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:56,260
pop up over there and you hit over there

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,330
well it doesn't work unless you're going

00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:01,780
to block the whole range and that might

00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:06,570
be a little more than the more careful

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:11,620
dns block lists are going to want to do

00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:14,890
i mentioned here about the range being

00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:17,770
well camouflaged camouflage in those

00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:20,620
terms i'm talking about the reverse dnf

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:23,710
forward and reverse dns of the IP

00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,750
address is in the range it's all they're

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:28,570
almost always going to have good forward

00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:30,280
and reverse DNS sometimes it looks

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,920
spammy though just you can just look

00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,550
down a list of a slant 24 and you can

00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:42,370
see names that just don't sound right

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:46,180
and oftentimes that's being used for

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:49,060
snowshoe snowshoe spam is becoming more

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:54,730
expensive as you all know in the past

00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:58,000
year we did run out of we I a na that is

00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,730
ran out of ipv4 address space it's all

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:06,520
allocated out to the regional registries

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:11,110
now so as the availability of ipv4

00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:12,910
addresses becomes less the address has

00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:15,460
become more expensive and we'll spammers

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,410
are all about not spending money they're

00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:21,160
all about offloading their costs onto

00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:23,950
everybody else so as I say we're seeing

00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,960
less and less snowshoe spam which is

00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:33,790
good because snowshoes been pretty hard

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:41,050
to fight moving on to the free mail

00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:43,060
accounts we have there's two different

00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:49,420
ways they're going to use free mail

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:56,800
accounts what's that I'm sorry I didn't

00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:57,970
hear you oh okay one way is as we talked

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:03,010
about before they're breaking the

00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,690
captions and they're signing up accounts

00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,100
for one-time spam runs and they're

00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:11,200
signing them up by the hundreds

00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:13,540
thousands these are real accounts with

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,940
free mail providers but they're

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:21,730
disposable they're going to just send

00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:25,060
one large spam run through that account

00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:28,630
and yes it's going to get past a lot of

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,490
filtering but then usually what happens

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,500
is the free mail provider is going to

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:36,360
detect that there was too much sent and

00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:40,570
they're going to shut him down hopefully

00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:48,310
excuse me another thing they'll do is

00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:52,270
they will crack a real users credentials

00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:55,560
for their mail account my own

00:13:52,270 --> 00:14:00,360
brother-in-law in real life passed away

00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,360
some years back and he was yay whoo user

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:08,190
six months after the funeral we heard

00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:08,190
from him nice to hear from you Ron

00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:16,209
no he was it was his account had been

00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:20,050
broken into by spammers and it was real

00:14:16,209 --> 00:14:22,180
easy to see we we got two messages about

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:26,769
12 hours apart when one of them was from

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:31,750
an IP address in Korea and the other one

00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:35,220
was in England so if he can get there in

00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,220
12 hours you're doing a pretty good job

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:44,350
another thing that these free mail

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:45,910
accounts do and and as it did for my

00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:48,910
brother-in-law well they got my address

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:56,200
from him they harvested his address book

00:14:48,910 --> 00:15:00,399
and added quite a bit to their spam list

00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:04,990
that way also some people don't realize

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:09,220
this but you can't trust the sender

00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:11,140
address on an email the vast majority of

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,510
spam that is sent out is sent out with a

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,560
false sender address you may be a real

00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:21,700
address but it wasn't as it was not sent

00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,740
by that person and so some people that

00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,560
don't understand this have white listed

00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,550
the sender address oh sure I want to

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:37,779
hear from wrong well it's not him it's

00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:43,630
spam finally we're getting to the

00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:47,440
botnets as I mentioned before botnet is

00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:51,760
the biggest single tool that that the

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:57,190
spammers are using now and in time to

00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:59,320
come the definition of a botnet is it's

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,470
a group of infected Microsoft Windows

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:06,490
machines with one or one of two basic

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:11,170
types of rat where now it is when we

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:14,550
don't know of any of this sort of rat

00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:18,150
where that has affected non Windows

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:25,460
users that includes Max and

00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:25,460
linux of course the two basic types and

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,350
we'll just touch on them here two basic

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:38,220
types are the direct to MX which means

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:40,650
the rat we're actually goes has a list

00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:44,180
of email addresses and it goes directly

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:49,110
to the mail server for those addresses

00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:52,050
it looks up the MX the mail exchanger

00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:57,180
record and tries to connect out on port

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,650
25 to send spam to that address the

00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,360
second kind and this is what is

00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:01,770
increasing and this is the subject of

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:08,160
the talk we're finally getting to that

00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:11,880
how far into the talk we are relaying

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:16,080
rat where that sends through the

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:25,110
infected persons mail user agent this is

00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:27,420
what I call the enemy within now let's

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:35,640
look at direct to MX rat we're a little

00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:40,440
bit here in general director MX rat

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:44,940
where is a solved problem for most mail

00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:50,430
systems at least for mine it's not a

00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:53,400
significant problem if you are affected

00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:57,410
by this say you're running a site that

00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:00,090
has a user with direct to MX rat where

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:03,270
you might be blacklisted well how would

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:07,830
that happen it happened to me in I think

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:15,120
2004 when I was maintaining a mail

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:19,290
server for a small company in Texas they

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:22,770
got some users with viruses that just

00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:26,610
started spewing out a lot of junk

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:32,970
we solved it real quick by blocking port

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:36,210
25 outbound there's really no reason why

00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,250
a mail client needs to connect out on

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:41,220
port 25 even if you're using an external

00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,780
mail service most of them are going to

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:48,240
offer a submission on port 587 and

00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:50,130
that's safe from spam because it's only

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,440
going to accept authenticated mail oh

00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:58,830
well it's safe them sometimes the spam

00:18:52,440 --> 00:19:02,640
you might say but it's not going to get

00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:06,090
the same type of abuse that port 25

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,590
gifts and then what you do with the

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,510
originating site will you clean up your

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:17,010
viruses we had our port 25 block there

00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:20,340
the Texas company and I had it logging

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:25,320
whoever was hitting port 25 well we

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:27,900
found him real quick we sent people in

00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,080
to get the viruses cleaned up and it was

00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:34,830
no problem anymore after a while we came

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,530
off the blacklist and it was all done

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,530
with it wasn't a real big deal during

00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:42,450
the time it was actually sending out we

00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:46,170
were blacklisted and our legitimate mail

00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:48,870
was being blocked not for the receiving

00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:52,830
site there it's also pretty easy we've

00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:56,880
got as i mentioned blocking port 25

00:19:52,830 --> 00:20:00,390
above there a lot of end-user ISPs do

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:02,850
that anyway I don't know how many of

00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:08,060
them do it these days but I know when I

00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:12,540
was on AT&T you can't go out on port 25

00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:14,790
who's that time warner does comcast did

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,830
when i was on comcast i was able to get

00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:18,780
out on 25 but i think they have changed

00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,290
that and it might be different in

00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,290
certain regions

00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:31,300
um yes AT&T in Ohio you can ask for an

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:34,090
override that's that's going to be true

00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:36,370
in a lot of ISPs that you're going to be

00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:38,770
able to go to them and say I would like

00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:42,190
to get out on port 25 and and they will

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:44,440
do it hopefully they're going to keep an

00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:52,450
eye on you and shut you down if you do

00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:54,450
get a spam zombie but that's your

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:59,380
responsibility to take care of that

00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:02,110
another thing that trips up the director

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:06,240
MX rat we're quite a bit is the

00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:06,240
behavioral problems that they exhibit I

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:13,030
imagine some of you folks are

00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:15,910
programmers here and can you imagine the

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:19,570
challenges that these rat where authors

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:21,220
face they're trying to get in a tiny

00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:24,070
little virus they're trying to get

00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:29,590
something that implements smtp in a

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:32,200
sensible way they they often they're not

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,650
able to rely on getting the replies back

00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:45,250
from the server smtp is an interactive

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:47,080
protocol we have several ways of

00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,970
tripping them up i mentioned here gray

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,640
listing which is not something i do or

00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:54,370
recommend any more but but it still does

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:59,050
trip up a lot of the zombies the greet

00:21:54,370 --> 00:22:00,880
pause and MX priority violations well a

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:05,740
lot of these things they go directly to

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,840
a secondary or lower priority mail

00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,510
exchanger rather than going to the first

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,090
one like they're supposed to do and then

00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:19,150
only to this to the lower priority after

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:21,370
they have hit the highest priority so

00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:25,390
overall it's not too big a problem for

00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:31,600
anyone and as we mentioned these the use

00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:33,190
of this direct DMX is waning and it

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,549
looks like I've kind of repeated myself

00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:37,409
on this next slide here

00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:40,230
see I didn't have time to prepare thanks

00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:48,629
to time order cable let's hear it for

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:49,950
time warner came cable Alan ok I'm just

00:22:48,629 --> 00:22:53,249
going to go over this real quick because

00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:56,940
I've already basically covered this many

00:22:53,249 --> 00:23:04,320
isps do block port 25 we look at IP

00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:08,100
reputation a lot of this is going to

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:11,369
come from dynamic IP address space that

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:15,659
is listed on the spam house policy block

00:23:11,369 --> 00:23:18,690
list or PBL which oh they started that I

00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:21,269
don't remember how many years ago four

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:28,230
or five and it has helped a great deal

00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:30,239
because it lists large areas of I of IP

00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:35,129
space that really should not be sending

00:23:30,239 --> 00:23:39,899
direct mail now if you have a mail

00:23:35,129 --> 00:23:42,029
server in pbl you have good forward and

00:23:39,899 --> 00:23:44,970
reverse DNS it does not look like it's

00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:47,549
dynamic it doesn't say that it's some

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:51,029
pool address or dynamic or user or

00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:56,580
whatever you can get yourself removed

00:23:51,029 --> 00:24:01,109
from that policy block list another

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:03,480
thing is that once direct TMX rat where

00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:06,899
starts sending out a lot it's going to

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:12,090
very quickly get detected by spam traps

00:24:06,899 --> 00:24:14,159
in such blacklist as the CBL the

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:20,159
composite block list which is part of

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:27,330
the spam house Zen list another thing

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:30,119
you'll see a lot of these zombies coming

00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:36,149
from host which don't have proper

00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:39,629
reverse DNS like nope PTR most of Asia

00:24:36,149 --> 00:24:45,119
is that way they don't have reverse DNS

00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:47,090
out there a lot of the end user space is

00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:51,800
going to have

00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:57,170
a PTR that looks clearly like its

00:24:51,800 --> 00:25:01,100
dynamic address some of them the pointer

00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:04,150
and the a record don't match so these

00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:08,570
are ways that you can often trip up the

00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:10,400
direct DMX and as I mentioned before the

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:13,700
Miss implementing of standards that

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,710
these tiny little zombies do one thing I

00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:19,640
wanted to mention about direct to MX rat

00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:24,620
where before we go on is that they were

00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:27,860
a little more careful in those days they

00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:32,810
way they coated those things they tried

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:35,600
to be like a proper parasite generally a

00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:40,310
proper parasite doesn't want to kill its

00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,800
host they tried to be undetected as they

00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:45,110
got more and more as the botnets got to

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,090
be bigger and bigger it was less

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:50,110
important to pump out as much mail as

00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:53,330
they could and so they they started to

00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:57,230
hold back a little bit and also try

00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:59,060
sending twice I mentioned gray listing

00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,370
well that's not as effective as it used

00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:03,370
to be because a lot of these director MX

00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:10,760
bots are going to be sending they're

00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:13,040
going to go through the list twice the

00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,930
second time you see it oh I've seen you

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,520
before so the gray listing

00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:26,380
implementation is going to say it's all

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:26,380
right real a rat where the enemy within

00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:35,210
that's what we were here for today what

00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:39,650
happens when your mail server that

00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:42,490
you're running has a user that gets

00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:45,590
infected by this relaying rat where

00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:48,770
you're going to notice two things real

00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:52,390
quick the first thing you're going to

00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,390
get is a denial of service

00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,890
this parasite doesn't care whether the

00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,230
host lives are not it knows that it only

00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:07,200
has a very brief window of opportunity

00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:08,880
to take advantage of it it's all an

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,540
automated process so it's going to keep

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,740
on spewing as long as it can but what

00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,570
it's going to do it's going to saturate

00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:26,360
your link it is going to send out as

00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:26,360
much spam as it possibly can now I'm

00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:39,970
then it's going to go on as your your

00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:44,040
mail server itself is going to become

00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:47,260
bogged down I've seen cases where you

00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:50,290
can't even SSH into the server because

00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:55,750
of all the use of bandwidth it's going

00:27:50,290 --> 00:28:01,840
to most sites have a bottleneck in terms

00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:03,850
of their uplink to the Internet and that

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,710
is that bottleneck is what's going to be

00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:11,830
full your mail queue is going to just

00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:16,300
keep growing and you're not going to be

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:19,990
able to get it out also as you start to

00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:22,060
get detected by the blacklists you're

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:24,940
going to get blocked there's your second

00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:26,500
denial of service that you get all the

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:31,000
major black lists are going to find you

00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:34,510
and most of the minor ones to all your

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,670
male belongs to spam and it's going to

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:41,920
be rejected even your legitimate mail

00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:44,820
you're a spam source people don't want

00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,820
to take mail from you

00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:53,440
the problem of relaying rat where is a

00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:56,799
little different than that of the

00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,100
director MX it's a much bigger problem

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,559
for the originating site because as it

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,169
says you will be blacklisted this mail

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:09,039
is coming from your server it's not

00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:10,990
coming from as far as anybody else can

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:16,919
see it's not coming from some zombie it

00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:19,120
is coming from one of your users to them

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:22,360
the fixes are not going to be real easy

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,779
you can't just block a port you're going

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,490
to have to know who is the cause of the

00:29:25,779 --> 00:29:31,119
problem and you're going to have to hunt

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:35,399
them down the receiving side is going to

00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:40,769
have different set of problems too at

00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:44,860
first your site is not going to be

00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:49,330
blacklisted and so the very first hour

00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:54,309
or so you're going to get quite a bit of

00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:57,730
the spam into people's mailboxes there's

00:29:54,309 --> 00:30:01,149
no behavior problem that like the Greek

00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:03,820
pause is not going to help because your

00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:05,860
server it's real MTA it knows to wait it

00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:08,230
has to wait for that greeting from the

00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,659
banner from the from the server that is

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:14,889
connecting to so it's going to sit there

00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:21,340
and wait it's not going to be an early

00:30:14,889 --> 00:30:24,070
talker eventually the site is going to

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:26,499
be blacklisted so it's not going to be a

00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,980
problem but it will be up front for the

00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:32,830
first little bit I have noticed in my

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:37,659
own mail I don't get that much spam but

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:40,570
I have noticed some of this class you

00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:42,970
can tell by looking at the header

00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:45,570
sometimes if it actually did come from a

00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,570
real MTA

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:59,040
there's a bunch of different ways to

00:30:53,430 --> 00:31:00,240
mitigate this problem and here I'm going

00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,930
to list it and then we're going to go

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:08,790
into each one of these on separate

00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:11,490
slides further on the first thing you're

00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:17,070
going to want to do is separate your MX

00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:18,450
mail the MTA mail transfer agent from

00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:22,110
your submission mail your mail

00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:27,570
submission agent you can do that all in

00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:32,910
one particular instance of an of a MTA

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:37,530
such as one I run I'm a postfix guy it's

00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:39,630
no problem to do that all in one you're

00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:41,640
going to one thing that I think helps a

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:46,550
little here is to require authentication

00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:48,510
for all your senders you from your users

00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:50,970
you're going to want to rate limit

00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:53,670
you're submitting clients you're going

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:55,230
to want to use content filtering but

00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:59,240
slightly different from what you're

00:31:55,230 --> 00:32:01,860
going to apply to the MX and bottom line

00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,410
if you can discourage the use of

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:09,870
Microsoft muas you're going to be safe a

00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:16,790
mail user agent as far as we know this

00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:20,130
is generally Outlook Outlook Express and

00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:22,320
well what's it called windows live mail

00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:24,930
or whatever the replacement of Outlook

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,570
Express was I've been out of that so

00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:29,570
long I don't I don't know

00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:39,570
okay separating MX mail from it from

00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:42,929
submission mail there's more than one

00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:46,410
way you can do that the best practice is

00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:47,850
to force your users on to port 587 Hey

00:32:46,410 --> 00:32:53,130
look if you want to send mail you're

00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:56,460
going to use port 587 to do it some

00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:58,740
people have problem some people are not

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,940
politically able to pull that off in

00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,590
their company but it's not a problem

00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,120
there either he's just going to you can

00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:11,760
just use the different IP address you

00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:15,570
can leave your submission mail on port

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:21,780
25 on one IP address and take your MX

00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:23,820
mail on a different IP address you can

00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:28,410
use a different host name for submission

00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:33,030
versus your MX now suppose you failed

00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:35,700
and you use o use mail example.com for

00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:37,470
both MX and for you told all your users

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:41,270
well send your mail through mailed up

00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:44,790
example.com that's not a problem either

00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:47,760
just make a new host name for your MX

00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:50,880
your users can still use mayo example

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,260
calm and you can make an MX dot

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:59,490
example.com and that can be where you're

00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:01,830
going to get your internet mail from as

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:03,360
I mentioned before the main reason

00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,770
you're going to want to do this is the

00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:11,280
different different requirements of

00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:12,780
filtering for submission male versus MX

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,950
and we're going to cover that under the

00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:21,570
content filtering page further down as I

00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:23,369
said I think helps a little to require

00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:25,919
authentication from your users when

00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:28,080
they're sending mail it does make one

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:30,419
more hoop for the rat where to jump

00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:36,320
through or one more little maze for them

00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:39,899
to run through you might say maybe I

00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:45,270
don't know as I said we think that this

00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:49,350
is invoking outlook via some sort of

00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:51,330
windows API so it's it really doesn't

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:53,429
matter that much but it sure does make

00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:56,040
it easier to identify who has the

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:59,240
problem all you have to do is look in

00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,330
your logs successful authentication from

00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:06,210
Joe and example.com well you know to go

00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:10,940
strangle mr. Joe you know go turn off

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:13,860
his computer and get him away from it

00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:16,140
it's a whole lot easier to identify and

00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:19,680
stop the abuse when you know exactly who

00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:21,510
it came from yeah you can do that with

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,130
IP addresses also but you're going to

00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,310
have to you might have to look up where

00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,110
that IP address is it's a whole lot

00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:36,990
easier when you have an actual name to

00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:38,670
associate to it now you're going to want

00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,220
to rate limit you're submitting clients

00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:49,940
this is not a silver bullet for the

00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:49,940
whole problem but consider how much a

00:35:51,140 --> 00:36:04,370
typical user can send out your rate can

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:08,430
be really pretty low for legitimate mail

00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:12,420
and to illustrate that I come packing a

00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:15,810
weapon today I'm prepared I've got a

00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:21,480
squirt gun here I can get you wet with

00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:24,000
this right ok back home I'm a volunteer

00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:25,650
fireman I have a fire truck I have a

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,380
two-hundred-thousand-dollar fire truck

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:34,110
with 2.5 inch fire hoses those can get

00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,690
you wet too which one you think is going

00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:39,029
to get you a little wetter it's pretty

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:42,609
easy to tell

00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:46,019
that's just it this relaying rat where

00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:55,349
is going to try to pump out that 2.5

00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:59,229
fire hose of spam at you a typical user

00:36:55,349 --> 00:37:03,130
gosh if you were really typing at high

00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:07,719
speed and or even just pointing and

00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:10,779
clicking in your mail client you're

00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:16,119
going to be lucky to send out maybe 30

00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:19,900
an hour and if you have a large list of

00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:25,630
CCS all on one male well that's just one

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:27,640
connection so I think you can set a

00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:30,789
limit of about thirty an hour and

00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,329
probably be pretty safe most people

00:37:30,789 --> 00:37:36,969
aren't going to be able to hit that the

00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:39,759
thing you're going to want to do is also

00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:42,660
set that to be a hard limit that when

00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:47,589
somebody hits that limit no more mail

00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,599
know if you try to send any more than

00:37:47,589 --> 00:37:52,479
that you're probably you probably have a

00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,630
relaying rat where problem you what you

00:37:52,479 --> 00:38:01,989
need to do is tie that in to disable the

00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:05,939
credentials of the sending user ID say

00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:05,939
shoot first ask questions later

00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:17,730
now I mentioned I'm a postfix person so

00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:17,730
I'm mentioning some postfix

00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:26,650
rate-limiting tools and the mill ters

00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:28,329
are actually there send mail creation so

00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,030
those will work with send mail also and

00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:33,690
I think Exim supports milkers too but I

00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:39,039
don't know there's any Exim users here

00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:44,770
no and for some reason i think is the

00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:47,049
dot info libreoffice didn't think that

00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,760
was a real URL so you get to you can

00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:52,470
actually read that one it's actually

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,589
white on blue instead of blue on blue

00:38:52,470 --> 00:39:01,059
the postfix policy protocol is a is

00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:04,150
another means of doing this and i've

00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:08,170
listed three that i know do rate

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:13,210
limiting of senders the post FWD I guess

00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:17,849
post firewall demon which is post FWD

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:22,240
org if you can't read that policy d

00:39:17,849 --> 00:39:24,160
policy d org and SQL gray which is a

00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,109
great listing implementation that also

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,329
happens to do rate limiting of senders

00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:33,700
SQL grade org and that's great with the

00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:40,450
ey that's the way they spell it for gray

00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:44,230
listing I don't know why moving on to

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:49,210
content filtering we got a short list of

00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:54,039
do's and don'ts here on your submission

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:59,470
mail you are going to want to do the URI

00:39:54,039 --> 00:40:03,849
BL test that's where your content

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:07,049
filtering software looks at URLs in the

00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:10,380
message body and it's going to have

00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:12,700
usually some sort of spammy domain there

00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:14,589
why are they doing this they're wanting

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,619
to sell something almost all the time

00:40:14,589 --> 00:40:19,820
that's what it is it could be politics

00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:23,350
also but

00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:23,350
they're too they're selling a product

00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:35,570
you are i BL is a URI block list there's

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:41,090
two major services of those you are i BL

00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:43,190
org and su rbl org these are very

00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:48,590
effective in content filtering that's

00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:50,840
also effective used in MX mail but you

00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:54,200
need that for your relaying rat where

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:58,990
for your submission mail you can also

00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:02,900
look at the spammy content rules like

00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:05,590
well I'm really not too big into spam

00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,510
assassin but I know they've got lots of

00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:10,070
different tests for things that are

00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:15,110
considered spamming for various reasons

00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:19,610
and those do help there are some types

00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:21,290
of content filtering that just aren't

00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:24,080
going to help in fact they're going to

00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:28,450
be counterproductive you do not want to

00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:34,010
do DNS BL tests on your received headers

00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:35,930
most of your users say you say you're

00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:39,470
trying to send mail from here through

00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:43,100
your submission server at home or gmail

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:47,080
or whatever it is it's going to have the

00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:49,760
hotel IP address is your originating IP

00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:53,810
I'll almost guarantee you that that IP

00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:57,700
address is blacklisted you don't want to

00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,700
look at your received headers and

00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:07,750
consider that mail that originated from

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,770
a blacklisted IP is not good because

00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:14,990
that's what we're sending from

00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:17,300
legitimate people do that another thing

00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:19,160
then is not good in your content

00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:22,940
filtering is white listing in general

00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,650
either two different types of white

00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:27,920
listing that you might want to use or

00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:29,600
our sender addresses as we mentioned

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,280
before the rat where might be using

00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,490
these sender addresses it might be

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,869
coming from you

00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:44,130
or user it might be coming from forged

00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:46,590
addresses also but if it's from your

00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,150
user is not really from that person you

00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:51,150
don't want a white list based on the

00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:53,880
sender address also if you're doing

00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:56,700
white listing of known good clients well

00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:01,590
gee I exchanged a lot of mail with this

00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,000
company over here example org I trust

00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:04,970
their mail servers so I'm going to

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,440
bypass my content filtering well know

00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:10,200
what happens when they get hit by the

00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,660
relaying rat where it will happen if

00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:20,460
there's windows users there it's going

00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:22,320
to happen I've listed here three content

00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,650
filtering tools that work with postfix

00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:32,640
they'll also work with most if not all

00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:36,420
other mail transfer agents a Mavis dinu

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:39,840
is a it's really not a content filter

00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:42,720
it's more like a framework for multiple

00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:47,040
content filters it receives mail via

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,630
smtp from the MTA and then runs it

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,619
through whatever scanners you have

00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:57,950
configured and passes it back to the MTA

00:43:52,619 --> 00:44:05,520
to be delivered it can be used as a

00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:08,910
before Q filter which I personally have

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:14,000
not done it's not as safe to do it that

00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:18,090
way in my opinion but but it is an

00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:25,020
option that you have a vez tu is written

00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:28,230
in perl which is rather ugly but it's a

00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:31,170
good project and so is spam assassin

00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:33,570
which is also in perl am a vestido new

00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:38,330
has the benefit of running a demon of

00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:38,330
its own and it invokes the spam assassin

00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:44,970
processing as a perl module within that

00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:50,640
process so

00:44:44,970 --> 00:44:54,180
one process gets you the smtp framework

00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,010
from a Mavis d new and it also runs you

00:44:54,180 --> 00:45:03,240
spam assassin for you so it's quite a

00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:09,060
bargain clamavi is a antivirus software

00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:11,460
that it can't hurt it's it hasn't been

00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:16,170
effective in sites that i have used it

00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:18,450
but it can't hurt there too it's going

00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:20,460
to be something that Mavis T is going to

00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:22,320
be able to pass directly to so you're

00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:23,670
just going to run as far as the MTA is

00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:26,040
concerned you've just got your one

00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:28,380
content filter and it's going to pass to

00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:39,330
both of those or even more you can even

00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:43,880
have other filters configured now I

00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:48,930
think we're to the last slide here yay

00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:53,040
suppose you got caught with your pants

00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:54,810
down you weren't prepared you hadn't

00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:01,490
done all this mitigation stuff that I

00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:01,490
was talking about what do you do well

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,160
Colorado for just a few hundred dollars

00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:12,570
I can take care of you just fine no

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:15,540
seriously i do i will i will work on

00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:17,130
these you can't send me email from your

00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,070
server because i'm going to be blocking

00:46:17,130 --> 00:46:21,660
you since you're blacklisted but you

00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:24,960
could get yourself a gmail account and

00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:27,359
contact me the first thing you need to

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,330
do the absolute first thing to do and

00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:35,849
there's no argument i get people arguing

00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:38,609
with me about this when they come into

00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:40,650
IRC with this problem or when they even

00:46:38,609 --> 00:46:43,770
had a fellow who hired me and he said oh

00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:47,190
no i can't stop my MTA I've got to be

00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:51,300
able to get bail well guess what you're

00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:54,119
not getting mail your pipe is saturated

00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:56,550
you've got all this junk that you're

00:46:54,119 --> 00:46:57,870
trying to send out and that's coming in

00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:00,920
from your

00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:03,570
used user you've got to shut it down

00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:08,040
you're going to stop the abuse right

00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:11,490
there once it shut down your log file

00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:14,850
which is going possibly faster than your

00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:16,020
syslog can keep up with you're just

00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:18,330
going to look at the end of it and

00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:23,580
you're going to see who your offending

00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:25,590
user was okay it was Joe at example.com

00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:32,040
so I'm going to revoke those credentials

00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:34,950
and we're safe now next you're going to

00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:40,980
go on and you're going to send your thug

00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:43,680
with your lard and you're going to

00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,940
remove the rat where from that users

00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,860
computer but you don't have to do that

00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:48,990
right away that's a low priority thing

00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:52,260
you've got it stopped that's the

00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:54,630
important thing next thing you have as I

00:47:52,260 --> 00:47:56,940
mentioned you've got a huge male q you

00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:59,630
may have thousands of males in your

00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:04,310
queue that you're not able to send out

00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:06,870
and this could be a challenge but

00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:09,990
usually it's usually it's not that

00:48:06,870 --> 00:48:12,960
difficult to identify all the spams that

00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:15,510
are being held in there you're going to

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,030
want to identify them and put them on

00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:20,420
hold or delete them you don't want to

00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,420
try them again

00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:29,440
as I said you're listed on various

00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:34,120
blacklist it depends how long you let

00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:36,940
the problem go as to how quickly you'll

00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:39,130
get back off of those lists but you're

00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,620
going to want to look and see on the

00:48:39,130 --> 00:48:44,910
composite block list which is I should

00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:48,700
have given the URL for that it is I

00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:52,180
can't think of it offhand but you can

00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:53,410
find it from Spamhaus org but you're

00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,860
going to want to check and see if you

00:48:53,410 --> 00:49:02,560
are listed on that CBL before you start

00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:04,330
your MTA up again if you're still listed

00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,650
on their most sites in the world are

00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:08,410
going to be rejecting you anyway so

00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:12,700
what's the point you don't want your

00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:14,740
legitimate mail to be rejected for a

00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,870
while after the fact we're after you've

00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:18,640
done the cleanup here you're going to

00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:24,510
want to keep an eye on the logs and see

00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:27,460
how much you're getting rejected and

00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:30,490
finally you're going to want to go into

00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:36,940
the mitigation strategies we talked

00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:40,090
about before and that was it does

00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:49,170
anybody have any questions or comments

00:49:40,090 --> 00:49:52,350
or or heckling or rotten fruit or beers

00:49:49,170 --> 00:49:52,350
go ahead

00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:57,440
domainkeys is a good idea yes I have

00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:04,350
that's not really going to be going to

00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,160
help very much in this particular

00:50:04,350 --> 00:50:07,160
instance

00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:19,620
I think you're talking about you're

00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:22,900
talking about being able to identify

00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:27,490
forged senders when you're talking about

00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:29,170
domain keys yeah it it does help

00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:33,160
somewhat at least you can look at the

00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:34,540
reputation of the sending host but yeah

00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:39,460
right it's not going to do much good

00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:42,970
with if I'm supposing in sending as your

00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:45,790
user well gee that's what it's supposed

00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:50,620
to look like the ones i have seen though

00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:53,170
I will say mostly used yahoo addresses

00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:56,290
the ones that I've actually cleaned up

00:50:53,170 --> 00:51:01,870
personally they use da who addresses

00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:04,380
from not just yahoo com but other yay

00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:13,480
whoo subdomains like Asian ones and and

00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:15,880
European anything else all right I think

00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:19,440
we're done thank you all for coming and

00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:19,440
I hope I didn't bore you too badly

00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,460
you

00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,880
when we created asterisk over a decade

00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:37,830
ago we could not have imagined that

00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:40,050
asterisk would not only become the most

00:51:37,830 --> 00:51:42,180
widely adopted open source communication

00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:44,220
software on the planet but that it would

00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:46,740
impact the entire industry in the way

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,720
that it has today asterisk has found its

00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,360
way in the more than 170 countries and

00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,310
virtually every fortune 1000 company the

00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:55,410
success of asterisk has enabled a

00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:56,790
transition of power from the hands of

00:51:55,410 --> 00:51:59,070
the traditional proprietary phone

00:51:56,790 --> 00:52:01,470
vendors into the hands of the users and

00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:03,420
administrators of phone systems using

00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,650
this power our customers have created

00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,570
all sorts of business changing

00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:08,430
applications from small office phone

00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,950
systems to mission-critical call centers

00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:12,540
the international carrier networks in

00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:14,340
fact there's even an entire country

00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,740
those communications infrastructure runs

00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:18,870
on Astra's the gym has always been about

00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,580
creating technology that expands

00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:22,740
communications capabilities in ways that

00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:23,940
we could never have imagined and that's

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:26,340
part of what's game-changing about

00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:29,040
Digium today we're doing it again this

00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:31,110
time by introducing a new family of HD

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,240
IP phones that extends control of the

00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:35,010
user all the way to the desktop the

00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,720
launch of these new products represents

00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,700
the next phase indigenous history of

00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,220
innovation these are the first and only

00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:42,570
IP phones designed to fully leverage the

00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,220
power of esther's when we first

00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,870
discussed our expectations for building

00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:48,480
a family of phones for use with asterisk

00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:50,280
our requirements were pretty simple we

00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:52,020
asked the team to build the phones such

00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,240
that they were easy to install integrate

00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,070
provision and use I think you'll soon

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:58,650
agree our engineers have delivered on

00:52:56,070 --> 00:53:00,270
that goal user feedback is validating

00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:02,370
that when it comes to operation with

00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:04,800
astro space systems including our own

00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:07,380
Switchvox based product these are the

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,700
easiest to use best integrated most

00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:11,280
interoperable products on the market

00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:13,250
today the Digium family of phones will

00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,330
initially include three IP des hommes

00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:17,150
uniquely designed to complement any

00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:19,140
asterisk or switch box base solution

00:53:17,150 --> 00:53:21,810
these phones are different for a number

00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:24,450
of reasons first there is clue sively

00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,890
designed for use with esters secondly

00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:27,500
we've made it really easy to

00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:29,880
autodiscover and provision the phones

00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:31,980
next we've made it easy for the phones

00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:34,030
to access information inside of asterisk

00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,520
allowing tight coupling between

00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:38,230
application and the phone additionally

00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:40,720
we've created an applications engineer

00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:42,910
that allows users and developers to

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,670
create and run their own apps on the

00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:47,740
phone and finally we've done all of this

00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:49,480
at a very compelling price point at

00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,670
digium we're always thinking of ways to

00:53:49,480 --> 00:53:54,010
give our customers the best value in

00:53:51,670 --> 00:53:55,330
business phone systems and also give

00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:57,430
them the power to create their own

00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:59,230
solutions or any communications

00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:00,910
challenge well continue to push the

00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:02,680
boundaries not only to make Astros

00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,540
cooler faster and more technologically

00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,100
feature-rich but to make asterisk and

00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:08,320
web communications even easier and

00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:11,250
together we'll change the way the world

00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,250
communication again

00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:19,070
you

00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:29,579
Klaus that's I every way this is the way

00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,200
to better utilize all your resources and

00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:34,650
it makes managing all your resources

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:38,480
pretty easy all of the innovation is

00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:42,000
happening in open source the

00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,770
collaborative nature and of the you know

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,720
of the community and then the speed at

00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,609
which these are these you know these

00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:49,770
these deficiencies these bugs are

00:54:47,609 --> 00:54:52,140
getting discovered and then fixed is it

00:54:49,770 --> 00:54:55,500
I think that really shows the power of

00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:57,150
the of the open source community it is

00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,349
global and it's definitely because of

00:54:57,150 --> 00:55:03,720
the users community people are extremely

00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:08,940
friendly and they're always ready to

00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:10,410
help if you go on tire see any day

00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:12,720
you'll see these guys helping each other

00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:15,089
out and they're all doing it like in a

00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,980
selfless manner the product is

00:55:15,089 --> 00:55:20,760
transparent for everyone everyone can

00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:23,220
look at the code base everyone can see

00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:25,829
how close that is being built nothing

00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:30,930
nothing is proprietary everything is

00:55:25,829 --> 00:55:36,420
open in many ways it's absolutely vital

00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:40,290
to the the unborn health card stack the

00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:44,310
most exciting event in recent memory for

00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:46,980
me was our first developer boot camp

00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:49,620
and our call gave people like maybe two

00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:53,580
weeks notice to come attend I was

00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:57,750
expecting 25 or 30 people so we ended up

00:55:53,580 --> 00:56:00,600
with 87 people and had to go get more

00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:03,120
chairs in the room twice everything

00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:06,390
within cloud computing is commodity and

00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:09,450
is open source and so I don't think that

00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:11,190
you will you'll see anywhere where open

00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:14,220
source is not pervasive in cloud

00:56:11,190 --> 00:56:16,950
computing and so i think it's i think

00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:18,300
it's an assumption i think when you talk

00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:19,410
about cloud computing you're really

00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:24,960
talking about open source cloud

00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:28,110
computing cloud sac is a robust solution

00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:30,510
for large deployments you have dozens of

00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:34,440
data centers and thousands of servers in

00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:37,080
each data centers these hardware is

00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,560
going to fail and CloudStack is designed

00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:43,290
to handle number one that mass scale

00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:46,440
number two it's designed to handle the

00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:48,990
failure that inevitably happens in large

00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:53,520
deployments we started working on cloud

00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:56,790
tech over four years ago and it was the

00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,560
original set of people working on it and

00:56:56,790 --> 00:57:02,670
a background of delivering software

00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:06,900
telcos and service providers lots of QA

00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:10,530
lots of users actually using it high

00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:13,590
availability is a key feature multiple

00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:15,780
hypervisors support different network

00:57:13,590 --> 00:57:18,780
models we can pick up whatever suits you

00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:20,550
better while step management server can

00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:24,240
be deployed in different physical

00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:25,890
machines it definitely has a huge

00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,900
footprint it's being deployed everywhere

00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:33,480
there's a major movie studio that they

00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:36,660
were using cloudstack they were using it

00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:38,760
to transcode video and i thought that

00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:40,410
was terribly fascinating what i found

00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:43,680
more fascinating is what they did during

00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:46,440
lunch where they would spin up you know

00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,820
50 or 60 game servers then as soon as

00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,450
lunch was over they would destroy all

00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:51,690
the instance

00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:54,240
go back to doing real work cloudstack is

00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:56,010
vast it touches so many different

00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:57,869
aspects and there's no one person that's

00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:01,290
kind of like a master of all those

00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:04,440
realms I think cloudstack as a project

00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:06,690
is going to be one of the leaders simply

00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:13,640
because it's some of the most feature

00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:13,640
folan and and robust platforms out there
